Del Seoul
"I'm a huge fan of Korean food and any type of Asian fusion. I have been here 4 times now, I figured it's time to write a review. The vibe is great, love the atmosphere, everyone is generally very friendly. BUT THE FOOD... phenomenal. The shrimp tacos, kalbi tacos, kalbi poutine, and chicken wings are my usual and I'll say they never disappoint. All the dishes are perfectly balanced with sweet and spiciness.. wash it all down with a cold Lagunitas IPA- perfection.Definitely a must try. Enjoy!"
"What a great way to spice up tacos!I ordered the blackened tofu and shrimp tacos. Both were jam packed with flavor and left my taste buds very satisfied! The tofu taco was especially good, while the shrimp was decent - not very fresh and I wasn't personally a fan of the aioli sauce it was dipped in..a little to creamy for my taste. But overall, all ingredients in both tacos worked together pleasingly well!Only had two tacos and I was full (usually I'll order 3-4)..my meal came out to ~$7 which is a great deal.I did not have anything other than tacos but dad was also highly satisfied with his tofu hotpot.Order at the register and your meal is delivered to you. Pretty quick service and easy enough.Happy that I live close by to this place. I'm sure I'll frequent it a lot!"
"I'm a huge fan of tacos and Korean food so this Asian fusion place fit to my liking. It has a comfy, hippy feel to it and the food is authentic. I got the spicy shrimp and kalbi tacos which I think are the two best. The spicy shrimp wasn't spicy, but tasted a little sweet. I would recommend getting the tacos at this place."
"Screw everything else. Get the Fish Tacos with sambal. OMGSuch a great find! Being from California, I have high expectations of Korean-Mexican fusion. I miss my beloved Kogi Truck, so Del Seoul was able to fill that small void in my heart with their amazing tacos. At around $3 - $5 depending on the taco, you get a very solid meal with all the right fixings.However, I can't say enough how delicious the FISH TACO was. It completely overshadowed the bulgolgi and kalbi tacos I ordered, which were fine, but irrelevant compared to the fish. There aren't a lot of places that use sambal as an ingredient, so you are in for a treat. This Southeast Asian chili paste will make you go woot woot, and the taco is where it's at.Seriously, I am getting hungry just thinking about this damn taco."
"All about the korean tacos. The shrimp taco remains the star, over the kalbi taco. Honestly, I'd recommend one to order shrimp tacos with kalbi poutine fries.  Soooo yummy. It's the perfect sweet, savory, creamy combination. I dabble with sriracha, of course.I keep meaning to try other K-fare, like the dumplings, and bibimbop... but really, when I think of this spot, I think of a quick, delicious bite. Not a lengthy sitdown spot, especially considering most seating is chairs only. I like booths and cushy seats for chatty dinner dates.  They cater to the clientele in the area, offering a selection of beer and wine to pair with K-food goodness. You can have stuff from pinot noir, to soda, to a Vandermill's apply raspberry cider. I feel like food quality does suffer if you happen to come in during prime dinner time, or a rush.  A line can swiftly build, but I think this spot generally  handles service well. Well worth a try! I still have to give it a 5 because I haven't found a place like it that could replace it."
"Korean fusion, Del Seoul just didn't capture my soul.After booking my visit to Chicago, I knew that I would have to look up all the must eats in Chicago. Frequently I found the tacos and the poutine to be some of the highly recommended dishes to try at Del Seoul. So I bookmarked it and set off to try Korean fusion (something I've never had before!).It was actually pretty crowded when I arrived, but we were able to get a table. You order at the front and then seat yourself. The food will be brought out to you. Utensils and napkins are found in the right hand corner, and you also bus your own table afterwards. I ordered the shrimp taco, kalbi taco and the street dumplings. The street dumplings are a popular item here because of it's 100 year old recipe. I didn't get the kalbi poutine, but I probably should have.The food came out promptly and I was pretty excited to try Korean tacos. The shrimp taco was amazing! It was dripping in sauce so just be aware that eating these tacos won't leave you looking like a beauty. I just loved how plump the shrimp was and the sauce that they had used. The veggies add a nice little crunch and of course the soft tortilla makes the greatest vessel. Now the kalbi tacos were the ones that got the most hype on some of the food websites I looked at. Unfortunately, it just didn't do it for me. Now I love KBBQ and kalbi is a must have. But I just didn't feel like the kalbi was shining very much in the taco. It really just tasted like julienned kalbi and tortilla. It tastes fine - just not outstanding.Now came the 100 year old recipe of street dumplings. It comes in a little steamer and there are 8 plump little dumplings that come with soy sauce. I was pretty excited since it's a customer favorite but was left wondering why this was a fan favorite. These dumplings were cooked perfectly and the filling was meaty but it just tasted like a steamed dumpling to me. I didn't feel myself saying ""Mm! These are so amazing!"" I really felt like I could have gone without. None the less, dumplings are dumplings so they were still pretty good to eat. I just thought I would be more amazed since it's such an old recipe and raved about.All in all, I could see Korean fusion work if done right. I didn't feel like my experience here shined through. It was still a good place to get a bite to eat with a bit of comfort to it."
"I think the best food that I've had on my Chicago trip was in Del Seoul! My favorite was their famous K-town Chicken wings. It was a bit spicy for me but there's so much flavor in it. The sauce was made with sweet soy chili and garlic glaze... Oh my.. Thinking about it makes me drool already. We also tried their famous kimchi fries, it was awesome! My friend told me that the beer that he ordered was good, probably it complimented the flavor of the wings."
"Walked here after visiting the Lincoln Park zoo and was pretty hungry. I thought it was a sit down restaurant, but you order at the counter, get a number and they bring your food out to you.I ordered the street style dumplings and the ktown chicken wings. The chicken wings are glazed in a thick sweet chilli sauce that was pretty spicy. I had to brush off some of the spice flakes. But they were really good, and the addicting spicy where you had to keep eating it. The dumplings were on the doughy side, but the filling was just so so. However I loved how they were served on top of the boiled tops.overall, a great chill spot for some korean food!"
"Del Seoul has got to be one of my most absolute favorite places! I've been here more than a couple times and it never fails to leave me satisfied! The area it's located in is perfect. There's a wide variety of food and shops all around. If you want dessert afterwards, Molly's cupcakes is literally a couple shops down. You could even make the hike to the corner for some Snow Dragon Shaved Ice if you wanted! Anyways, Del Seoul is a pretty chill place with chill music. You just order and sit anywhere you like. It's never been packed when I've gone, and food comes out really fast. The workers are always super friendly and patient. On the last visit, I had the kalbi taco and the shrimp taco. I always get the shrimp taco so I'd highly recommend that. You'd think the kalbi taco would be more flavorful, but in my opinion it isn't (and I love kalbi). I had the kimchi fries, but for a couple dollars more you could get the kalbi poutine. I prefer the poutine over the kimchi fries but both are good nonetheless (although a little heavy). And when I'm really hungry, I almost always get the bulgogi bento box. I don't usually get bulgogi when I go to a Korean restaurant but for some reason, it's really good here. It comes with a small salad and some rice. Everything on the menu is so affordable and you can get a lot of food for not much at all. For some reason, I tend to overspend when I come here. Don't be afraid to try anything new because everything I've had from here has been on point. Even though there are a lot of restaurants around this area, I'm always down for some Del Seoul!"
"Boy oh Boy! Everything I ordered here was indubitably delicious! From the delicately battered fish tacos to the perfectly seasoned kimchi fries!  The flavors formed a beautiful medley for every mouthful.  The Sambal Fish Taco was probably my favorite item here.  The Sambal Aoli the taco was dressed with really added an extra kick to each bite.  The Bulgogi Bahn Mi however was lacking some heat. It would have been a bit more enjoyable if it had a couple of slices of jalapenos. The Kimchi Fries were bomb.com! I love that they didn't skimp on any of the sauces, spices, or meat."
"The sesame-chili shrimp taco ($2.99) is advertised as their best taco.It is. It's a perfect mix of crunchy lettuce in soft tortillas keeping the sweet and spicy shrimp company. Yummmmmm.Also worth your notice? All the other tacos. My youngest enjoyed the kalbi tacos because they involved his favorite meat without the bones. The kimchi fries are also worth every calorie. I would prefer spicier kimchi, but I can't completely reject the blend of kimchi, tender pork belly, green onions ON TOP OF HOT FRIES!!! We also had the dumplings and kalbi bento box. Both good, but not the best we've had because homemade Korean always takes the cake. However, if you have a pickier eater you won't go wrong with these two items."
"I can't say I've ever had Korean BBQ tacos so this place definitely piqued my interest. Food was decent, but didn't blow me away. I had the shrimp taco (advertised as their best) and spicy pork BBQ taco. I'm not too sure why the shrimp is considered their best because all I tasted was the tortilla and the lettuce thrown on top. The shrimp is noticeably flavorless. The pork was better.However, the star of the show is definitely the kalbi poutine! I was drooling the second I laid eyes on this beauty. The fries were perfectly done and had just the right amount of onions, scallions and tender kalbi!! They could have easily just thrown on a few pieces of kalbi, but I was so happy they didn't skimp on the meat! I was fighting off my friend so I could have more.If I lived in Chicago, I know I would come back for more. When I left, I was pretty full but that didn't stop me from eyeing the delicious looking bento boxes other people ordered."
"KIMCHI FRIES! This is my favorite new discovery all year. Fries, kimchi, pork belly, melted cheddar and jack, sour cream, and scallions. Holy shit. I've fallen in love with Korean Fusion fries. This place was on my hit list for this Chicago trip. When we approached the entrance of the place the door threw me off. The little weather shield things were annoying to get through the front door. Inside the restaurant was pretty empty aside from two tables with customers, that was a little worrisome, but it was only 4pm. Looked like a pretty laid back place. You order at the counter, take a number, and grab a table. We went with the kimchi fries, and one sesame-chili shrimp taco to share, and a couple of beers, $21, not bad. My boyfriend tried the fries first, he said he didn't want to comment on it until I tried it for myself. Judging by how many times he went back to scoop more into his mouth, I knew it was good. It was insanely good, the kimchi did not overpower at all. Try this shit. The taco was damn good too. There was an explosion of flavor for such a small little thang. Warm, tasty corn tortilla. The shrimp were panko crusted, I think I would have liked it better just sautéed. Customer service was fine, not over the top, but friendly enough. I felt like the restaurant, although trendy, looked a bit tired. Aside from that though, the food was exceptional. Take your ass to this place. They do fusion right!"
"Yesterday I tried this place as a late lunch after a day at the Shedd. My friends always talk about here and compare it to Bop n Grill, so I thought i would give it a try! My sister ordered some type of fish taco and Kalbi taco. She seemed to like it! There were veggies on top of each with a nice mustard-like sauce on the fish taco.My uncle ordered the shrimp taco, BBQ taco and kalbi taco. They all looked great and we're just the right portions. However, I wouldn't say they are the best tacos in all of Chicago. They're easy to make, the tastes are all very unique and fun because of the fusion, but they're not incredibly fancy or anything. If you've never had Korean food, or tacos, or Korean food in tacos, I'm sure these will definitely excite your taste buds.I ordered the bulgogi bahn mi and that was super yummy. The bread was a bit hard/crispier than others but it was fine. The bulgogi was marinated well and the jalapeños were no joke - definitely some real spiciness there. I wish they would've added a bit more meat in the sandwich though.We also shared one order of kimchi fries - it's basically cheese, stirfried kimchi, French fries and basic seasoning. I enjoyed them, but I have to say that Bop n Grill's kimchi fries are way better.It was a fun place to try - definitely one that deserves to be on the list, but it's more like although I wouldn't mind coming back, I'd rather hit bop n grill."
"Del Seoul is amazing and I have been here way too frequently despite living in Hyde Park. It's a little pricey for what it is, but I never regret the purchases once I'm eating the food. They really hit the nail on the head for fusion food in Chicago. The shrimp tacos are hands down my favorite item on the menu - a must order for anyone coming to Del Seoul. The Kalbi poutine fries are what dreams are made of - perfect to share, or to eat all by yourself. Their entire menu is delicious but I beg you: get the shrimp taco.It's one of those places where you order at a counter and sit down to eat, so it's fairly relaxed and generally pretty busy. You usually don't have to wait for a seat, however."
"The food here is awesome! We got sambal fish tacos and sesame-chili shrimp tacos. I like the shrimp one better. The fish and shrimp are fried with a bread shell outside, very tasty! The spicy tofu hotpot is good too but not that unique. It taste like usually tofu dish, but I do like the combination of soup, seafood, and tofu in one pot.Kimchi Fries is a must try! The sourcream and sautéed kimchi fully covered the usually greesy taste of French fries. I couldn't stop eating them:)I didn't give a five star b/c of the environment. The place is really small and crowded. It's hard to walk though the tables...and you can definitely hear every word from the neighboring table conversation indeed..."
"Another staple. I've had the fish, kalbi, and shrimp tacos. The sesame-chili shrimp tacos are my favorite. The kimchi fried rice is good, too. Kalbi poutine is delicious and good for sharing. I like their seasoned fries, too, but I consider that an individual serving. Hey, I love my fries."
"After ordering my food, the song Forever Young by Rush was playing and they had me right there.  That was a pretty popular new wave song back in the 80s when all the Asians were so into new wave music.  The music just hit the right tone.As for the food, I ordered a tofu, fish, and shrimp taco.  Everything was tasty.  There wasn't one I liked better than the other.  I mean, it was pretty creative.  I knew how he made the secret slaw, it's a Korean way of dressing up lettuce as a banchan dish which I thought was clever.  It went really well with the shrimp.  As for the the fish, it was the freshest piece of filet that I tasted.  Lastly, I left the tofu for last and thought I would like it the least but I was wrong.  It was just as tasty in this green sauce they whipped up along to go with it.  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and am so happy they're near my apartment.  Love their food."
"From a foodie's perspective, I would say the taste of food was worth three (3) stars.  Nevertheless, the chic and coolness factors were a solid four (4)-star quality.  Before commencing on my review, I would like to ask you yelpers one thing.  Let's say that you are taking a walk on the street, and you see an Asian person passing by you.  Can you tell whether that person is Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Thai, or some other unusual mixture of oriental heritages?  I can tell about 95% of time because I work in a retail environment, and I see more than 200 people per day in average.  In other words, I can profile people well because I can distinguish manners, gestures, and speeches among different races and ethnicities.Food at Del Seoul, to me, is similar to a mixed child coming from a Korean dad and a Japanese-Vietnamese mom.  The entire family happens to live either in America or in Mexico.  Does that make any sense at all?  You can shout out ""NO"" and I wouldn't be offended.  From what I have observed, they serve pan-Asian style food with a strong Korean emphasis.  With that being said, one shouldn't get too caught up with the authenticity of the food because pan-Asian cuisines are consisted of multiple origins.  To be honest, it's difficult to judge food like what I had this evening because I don't have anything to be based on.  I had the bulgogi bento box, and hubby had the hot stone bimbibap.  They do have lots of vegetarian-friendly items, if meat isn't going to tickle your fancy.  My bulgogi slices were tender, but the entire dish was a bit sweet for my palette.  I noticed hubby was quite diggin' the bimbibap he ordered.  The sauce also had a sweet undertone.  I would say the food here has the city of Chicago ""chic"" factor.  The service we received was very friendly considering it's a ""counter-service"" type of establishment. Overall, it's the right type of restaurant that matches to the neighborhood demographics (Lincoln Park).  I say it's also slightly pricer than a fast-food restaurant but less expensive than most full-service restaurants in the Lincoln Park neighborhood.  We spent $29 and some change for two (2) entrees and two (2) fountain pops.  That's why Del Seoul has its own ""niche"" to rise above among other local restaurant businesses in the city of Chicago.Hubby has come here twice already!  He's Italian, English, Irish, and Croatian, but I bet his tongue, stomach, and intestines were ""borrowed"" from an Asian man because he has too much love for Asian food!  For the sake of his happiness, we will be back."
"I dropped in on a lovely Chicago spring afternoon Saturday.   Kind of off hours so it was not too packed around 4pm.  Del Seoul is fusion korean food which I think is a happening trend that is sure to stick around.  The complex flavors of sweet, sour and savory are all present with many of the dishes.  Casual atmosphere where you order at a counter with video boards displaying the menu, then get a number.   You could have a beer or sample some Asian soft drinks as well as the typical Coca Cola help yourself fountain.  I've previously tried their burrito and the korean poutine fries, I enjoyed every bite.  The bento boxes seemed like a very generous portion of food - it should have filled me even in my college days when the motto was to consume mass quantity.  I was walking by, looking for a snack.  Just was gonna order the fries with aioili, but I accepted the upsell challenge and went for the kimchee fries.  Del Seoul even sells their own jars of the fermented korean cabbage.  The kimchee had bits of pork belly and some crema cheese which was a great combination.  Texture of the fries was good and crisp as required.   The portion was a bit disappointing though, figured I'd get a slightly larger portion for $6.95, but hey taste was there!   I'll be back.  Good times."
"Super super good! Great tacos with a little bit of flare but not over the top with weird toppings. It's supposed to be fast casual but everything looked so good we had to sit down and look at a menu for a couple minutes before going up to order. We had a few tacos- chicken, pork, & fish and steamed dumpling everything was fantastic and came out quickly. The pork taco was my favorite super flavorful and the meat was cooked just right. The fish was heavily battered but still good and I loved that it was haddock rather than tilapia which you normally find in the Midwest. Tacos are my absolute favorite food and Korean BBQ tacos are no exceptions. This place is an absolute must try for taco lovers!"
Grabbed carry out from Del Seoul.Some of the best tacos I've ever had.The fish tacos were my favorite.
"Del Seoul blew our minds last night. I'm literally picking my new apartment based on its proximity to this restaurant. If you think I am exaggerating, you either haven't been or you ordered the wrong thing. Or you're just delusional.I've been a pescatarian for 5 years, but I can't resist a good chicken wing. Usually, I taste one and I'm like ""eh, not as good as I remember."" This one I tried and was like ""THIS IS ALL I WANT TO EAT FOREVER."" Seriously, out of this world. Spicy, sweet, sticky and perfectly crispy on the outside and very moist on the inside. Amazing.The shrimp taco though stole the show for me. It was the PERFECT taco. The fish taco was delicious as well. A nice hunky piece of fish that resembled a twinkie and was so moist and fresh. All the food was fresh and hot which is also really wonderful. MUST gets (in descending order of MUST get-ness): 1.) Sesame chili shrimp taco, 2.) K-town chicken wings, 3.) Sambal fish tacoTotal cost of 4 tacos & wings: $28Other things to note: This isn't a waiter service restaurant. I didn't know that before I went in. But, NO complaints here--just makes it more comfy when I go here by myself every day once I move."
"My last Chicago review, au revoir Chicago! My friend suggested this place for my farewell lunch. Loved the shrimp tacos, forget about the others (I also tried the short rib tacos, but they paled in comparison to the shrimp). Had a taste of my friend's dumplings, but I'm not a fan of dumplings in the first place and these tasted a bit dry to me, lacked flavor and seemed a bit bland. You must get the poutine!!! It's heavenly and has a ton of meat...melt in your mouth deliciousness! I was not expecting one of the best poutines I've ever had to come out of a Korean taco place, but pleasantly surprised. I would totally come back and order just shrimp tacos and poutine and stuff myself silly. Great, friendly service too."
"I absolutely love this place. It's a great place for college students because you don't have to worry about splitting the check-- instead you order and your food is served to you. The Kalbi poutine is probably the best item on the menu, but I also love their banh mi. Anything you get here is sure to be good!"
"I am from Michigan - some friends who live in the city had us try Del Seoul while there for a weekend and now I crave them!  I had the chili shrimp, kalbi, and pork tacos.  The slaw adds an awesome crunch and the meat is full of flavor.   We ordered kimchi fried rice to split - which was not exceptional, due to the overcooked egg on top.  However, for the tacos alone this place gets 5 stars.  Will frequent this place every time i'm in Chicago."
"One of my favorite places to go in Lincoln Park! This is a casual korean fusion affair, and if you come expecting this you will be happy.Del I always order a shrimp and kalbi taco with gamja fries on the side. The beef is very flavorful and compliments the crisp and refreshing slaw on top. Likewise for the shrimp, which is deep fried in a batter with a tangy aioli. Fries are normal, but the seasoning makes it a tad bit different. This is a great place after a day at the zoo. You can pair the place with Molly's Cupcake right on the block for perfect dessert to compliment Del Seoul!"
"BEST TOFU TACOS EVER! The sauce that they put on the taco is AMAZING and the veggies are super refreshing with the blackened tofu. The vegetarian hot bowl is also good, but go easy with the red sauce. It is really potent. I don't pass out 5 stars often, but this is well deserved!"
"I've been to Del Seoul twice now - the first was on St. Patty's Day when they were slammed and they basically forgot my order. Which was the shrimp bahn mi, and when it did finally come it was delicious. The second time, I ordered the k-town wings with sticky rice and kimchi. WOW am I glad I came back! Highly recommended. Seating is first come, first served and really casual. You order at the counter and they bring it out to you. You get your own drinks, and bus your own table at the end of the meal. If you need anything else though, service is pretty friendly."
"I've been stuck on Asian fusion lately so Del Seoul was a must try. Might I say, it was pretty damn yummy. I ordered wings, tacos, and kimchi fries, and nothing disappointed. The wings were juicy and that sauce was tasty with just the right amount of kick. The fish, kalbi, and tofu tacos were all amazing (not crazy on tofu but one of the employees recommended it so I said screw it and took it on. lots of flavor, thanks dude!) the kimchi fries were great but I was sold on the wings and tacos. All the staff was very friendly and accommodating. I will definitely be back again!"
"Overall: Lunch Review: Fantastic food at a reasonable price, Del Seoul is a great lunch or takeout or quick dinner option.The good: The food is fantastic. Lots of tacos to choose from and great tasting meats and toppings. The bipimbop is also fantastic. I'm sure all the other offerings are great as well. Serves beer. The atmosphere is clean and the music was trendy.The bad: Not much, the restaurant was a little cold.Atmosphere: 9/10Service: 9/10Food: 10/10"
"I've got a thing for fish tacos. Blackened. Grilled. Tempura. You name it. There's just something so delicious about a light and well-cooked piece of fish wrapped in a soft tortilla and loaded with zesty aioli and plenty of crisp lettuces.But Del Seoul broadened my seafood taco horizons. Here, my heart belongs to the Sesame-Chili Shrimp Taco.  Hand-battered panko shrimp is piled into a warm white corn tortilla along with toasted sesames, cilantro-onion relish, slaw and sesame-chili aioli. It's sweet and spicy, soft and crunchy and perfectly chewy all at once. Above all, though, it's just really fulfilling - the best taco I've ever had.Prices are reasonable, the atmosphere is relaxed and the menu includes an array of Korean-fusion street foods making Del Seoul a fitting choice for Taco Tuesday or any other day of the week."
"The food here is solid for the price. The best thing off the menu is the bulgogi bibimbap but the recently featured spicy chicken platter is not far off at all at second.Its a casual joint but the service is really fast and efficient, rarely any mistakes in the time I've been a regular."
"Not to be confused with the early 90's hip hop group, Del Soul drops the hits on the Koren food front, and Me, Myself, and I youtube.com/watch?v=FJEz… are absolutely in love them! The street food sensation features tacos, banh mi sandos, rice bowls, and other sharables for super cheap. I'm talkin' two people for under twenty bucks cheap, and that doesn't mean you're eating kibble. They do delicious hand-battered panko shrimp, grilled beef short rib, chicken with Korean red pepper marinade, and of course kimchi. There's no bar or booze but at over 1000 reviews and 4 stars strong it's pretty obvious that people love this place. You can either get there or miss out on the creation of kalbi poutine."
"I strongly believe that the price, customer service, food quality, and location of Del Seoul to be one of the best. We didn't dine in, but I believe it might be BYOB (don't take my word for it). I'll have to update you all next time we decide to take in the whole experience and eat our food there.Cheers!"
"After craving it for some time, I finally made it back to Del Seoul. This time I tried the shrimp taco with flour tortilla substitute. I'm not sure if I'm just imagining it, but I feel like they give you more filling with the flour tortilla since its wider, so it's worth the extra 25 cents extra on the flour tortillas substitute. The shrimp as delicious. Flavored perfectly, with the perfect chewyness."
"Overall I was pretty happy with this place. It was packed when we went in on an early Saturday afternoon but we were able to find a table right after we ordered. Here's was we got...Kalbi Poutine - This was pretty good, but the more I ate it the more I lost interest. I wish the meat was more Korean style and not like a shredded stew meat. And I wish it had more spice. I can tell this is a popular item because a lot of people were ordering it. But next time I come here I'll probably try the kimchi fries instead.K-Town Wings - I really liked this! They've got a great sauce and are super crispy with a little kick. They tell you that it takes 12-15 minutes to prepare, but it's worth the wait!Sambal Fish Tacos - These were excellent! I was really impressed by how well the fish was cooked and the samba slaw really made it a great dish. I decided to get corn tortillas instead of the flour, but that's just my personal preference. I'm looking forward to ordering these again and trying some of their other tacos."
"I'm not into Mexican food but the idea of fusion korean/mexican is AMAZING First of all, the price is sooo reasonable with the perfect portions. The food is very tasty and solid. It's a unique place and I've never had anything like it. Lastly,  I can always come back here and try everything they have. I especially love thier Kimchi fries. It's like nacho and salsa. But fries and kimchi stuff instead, who wouldn't love that idea?Ugh. I'm getiimg hungry just talking about all of these!"
"Had take-out fish and meat tacos. Was a wonderful combo of flavors and textures. Tortillas were fresh as was the fish and toppings. As far as take-out tacos, they did a great job. Good packaging worthy for leftovers. Will come back!"
"Been here multiple times and have loved it each time. I've had the bulgogi bento box, the bulgogi banh mi, the kalbi poutine and the bibimbop. Loved each and every one of the items. I've never had to wait for a seat the the food comes out pretty quickly. I'll definitely be back to try some of the other items like the tacos and kimchi fries."
The shrimp taco is one of my favorite. Whenever I am in this part of the town I make it a point to go here.
"Del Seoul is an excellent little Korean fusion restaurant. You order at the counter, grab your utensils, and then the staff brings it out hot. It's small, clean, and appears to stay pretty busy. I had the Shrimp, Kalbi, and Spicy BBQ Pork tacos. They were all delicious but I'd have to say the Shrimp tacos were, surprisingly, my favorite. I tried the Veggie Bibimbop too and that was very, very tasty and fresh. I wish I lived closer because I'd love to go here regularly. I'd really like to try the Bento Box meals, their Kalbi ""Poutine,"" and those wings!If you're ever in this area of Clark, you should definitely try Del Seoul. You won't be disappointed!"
"Super low-key, no frills place, so if you're looking for a high end restaurant, stop reading. However, you will regret trying the food.........One of the best Korean tacos I've had! It's a hike to walk here from the CTA, but it was well worth the walk. The three of us split the Sesame-Chili Shrimp, Kalbi and Spicy BBQ Pork tacos because we wanted to try a few. They were all amazing and had great flavors. We also got right pieces of pork dumplings (not bad) and the kimchi fries. Get the kimchi fries, they are a must."
"Another visit and another great experience.  Kalbi poutine is a must-get, just nice collection of flavors.  Shrimp and pork tacos both tasty.  We ventured out and got the Spicy Pork Banh Mi sandwich.  The meat was good quality, but the concept of Banh Mi just didn't impress me much, I think there needed to be a bit more sauce and the pickled vegetables are an acquired taste.  We also tried the K-Town chicken wings.  The soy/chili/garlic glaze was a nice combo, but I don't think worth the $9.50 price tag for 8 pieces."
"I love this place!I had both the shrimp and breaded fish taco and they are soooo tasty!I also had the Kalbi bento box. It came with the Kalbi, rice, and salad. The salad was great and the Kalbi...well...I are it all!I'll be back to try some other things for sure."
"So what is there to say about this place that hasn't already been said.  Pretty doggone good is the assessment.  In an area with relatively stiff competition, Del Seoul easily holds its own.  The shrimp taco was amazing and saw was the fish taco.  The spicy chicken bulgogi was great, although I thought the meat could have been a tad warmer. This place is foodgasm city.  Stop denying yourself and get there!"
"What can I say that hasn't already been said?The shrimp taco is really good. Eat it. Actually, eat two. The fish taco is also really good. You should eat it too.The only downside is that I wish Del Seoul was open later."
"Fish taco is a must... As per usual. I love their fries with all the works (not the kimchi one). Except, too much sour cream(?) and pickled onion. I'll have to inquire about lessening such ingredients next time (keep point: there will be a next time for you, fries!!)"
"This was a great place if your in the city and looking for some GOOD Korean food/BBQ. I love when the server takes time to answer any questions and provide suggestions. We started off with one shrimp and one kalbi taco. Both were great. We also ordered the kalbi poutine. This was the best dish we had all night, just perfect. Good for 2 people to share. Finally, we got the kalbi box. (Kalbi, rice and salad) this was a great trip, meat came out sizzling on a hot plate.Service was great, food was great, and the price was right. Avg 15$ a person. I would highly recommend this place."
"Back home, I had never heard of Korean bbq tacos so I was leery about trying del seoul, but it's easily my favorite place for a quick bite. I usually go with my bf and get 1 of each taco. along with pot stickers or a bento box"
"Kimchi fries. Get those. Topped with onions and pork belly. Also, get the kalbi poutine. My favorite. Had delicious short rib and cheeses. I also tried one of their tacos with the sesame chili shrimp. This was so yummy! I loved this place. I want to try more things!"
I got the kalbi tacos and they were super good. The steak had a nice flavor and the coleslaw on top really brought that flavor out. My boyfriend had the kalbi box dinner and it came out on a hot plate and it was pretty cool.
"Kalbi Poutine. That's all you need to know. This was my first time back after a few years and they've added a few things to the menu. Kalbi Poutine was one of them. I shared it with a friend and both of us scarfed it down within minutes and openly wished we weren't sharing with each other. It was seriously the best poutine I've ever had. Fries smothered with heaps of their special beef gravy, seasoned crema (tasted like sour cream only better), and lots of chunks of kalbi. Topped with pickled onions. I'm drooling all over my keyboard. After I ate/snorted the poutine I ate my tacos. I got the sesame-chili shrimp and BBQ pork. They were good but not mindblowing (hence the 4 stars). They taste like how I remember them years ago, so I'm glad they've stayed consistent. I've had the kimchi fries and bibimbap here and both were good, too. Next time I'm going to order the chicken wings and poutine and share with nobody."
"Being Korean myself and growing up eating Korean food my entire life, I am always a little skeptical about ""fast casual Korean food"". Other places have tried and they usually tend to come up short. I am happy to say that Del Seoul exceeded my expectations.The pricing is reasonable and the ""tacos"", while not exactly Korean, are excellent! The galbi is as good as you would get at a higher priced Korean restaurant. Highly recommended."
"I took my husband here after a co-worker gave me a sample fish taco.  Good god almighty, they're amazing.  So amazing, I had to share. We went in on a Saturday afternoon, stood in a quick moving line, and ordered 2 shrimp, 2 fish, and 2 kalbi tacos, 1 fountain drink and one hot tea - Citron ??  Service was very quick, the place is well organized, if crowded, and as long as you know you're in for an order at the counter experience, it works.Bottom line, the fish and shrimp tacos are 5+ stars, as was the hot tea, which had fresh lemon shreds at the bottom.  It WAS sweet, but they advertise it that way, and I loved it.  The kalbi tacos were disappointing - the meat was a bit tough and not as tasty as I would have liked.   We didn't try anything else, but probably will sample the dumplings next time.And there will be a next time."
Food was good but there are much better options for tacos in Chicago. It didn't taste that much different than pork tacos I would get from a Mexican place. The poutine fries were also slightly disappointing for the price point.
"Visited here a few times in the past but never reviewed. With that said, one of my favorite places!! Korean-Mexican fusion at its best. The shrimp tacos are fantastic and happen to be my favorite. However, you can't go wrong with the chicken or beef tacos. Tremendous flavor. I've also had the kimchi fries and dumplings which are equally delicious. Walk up to the counter, order your food, take a seat. Consistently great tasting food, you won't be disappointed."
"these tacos i like. this place is more korean than mexican and you can see this on how they prepare their tacos. ive been to chicago 3 times in the last year and i think ive been here every single time. food comes out fast enough. i also had their spicy seafood hot pot (during the winter) and although it took a bit longer than anything else, it sure was good, warmed me up and you cant beat the price."
A little gem in Lincoln Park.An excellent lunch spot for the Korean connoisseurs and novices alike.Kalbi tacos and Kimchi fries are musts.Beers and wine served.
"I recently became a fan of Korean fusion food, and the Korean-Mexican dishes have continued to surprise my palette. Who knew Korean food and spices can be so deliciously adapted into different cuisines?I got the galbi and shrimp tacos, both of which were really good. We also got an order of the galbi fries, which was yummy but I think I would ask for more pickles because the cheese/sour cream sauce is sometimes overwhelming. If you go for lunch, the bento boxes are also really filling.Del Seoul is also in a hip part of the city that is great to walk around in."
"Perfect for a snack or meal. Fish, shrimp and kalbi beef tacos were yummy. Add the flavored fries and that was enough to hold me over to dinner. They also have main course meals to fill you up for those with a Korean appetite!"
"Del Seoul serves up some damn good fusion food.Incredible shrimp tacos (make a point to get their fantastic fried shrimp in some form or another!), great kalbi tacos, and I can never resist a side of the craveable kimchi fries. Kimchi must be one of the most underutilized ingredients there is, why don't more people do this? It's such a good and simple idea.Would skip the sandwiches and bowls, they're good but the carb-to-protein/tasty stuff ratio is a lot better with the tacos!"
"With the kitchen closing in less than 15 minutes, my friend and I rushed to find parking so we can grab a late dinner at Del Soul before it closes. Parking was easy to find since it was a late Wednesday night. We only had to pay for parking until 10 PM and it was $2/hour.You have to order first before you sit down with your order number and wait for the staff to bring it to you. We got 2 orders of tacos each. I got the kalbi and spicy bbq pork taco with an order of the kimchi fries. 4 tacos and the fries + tax and tip came out to $22. It is a pretty good deal for a dinner for 2 people.I don't remember the difference between the kalbi and spicy bbq pork but they were both very yummy. I didn't think it was spicy at all and had to put a little bit of Sriracha to give it a little kick.The kimchi fries came out a little later than the tacos and I wished it came earlier so I could have eaten it with the tacos. The fries were delicious, although they may have put on a bit too much sour cream on the fries. I really like the blend between the fries and the kimchi. It is definitely shareable and I don't think I would have been able to finish it by myself.I would definitely come back! Kitchen closes at 9:30 but you can sit and eat a little bit longer."
"Absolutely enjoyed the kalbi and chicken tacos alongside the gamji fries (forgot how to spell it XD) nice meal to enjoy on a summer night, dining outside. Definitely coming back when i can :D"
"Kalbi Poutine fries are my faveeeee, first time I tried it I couldn't get over how good it was. I also tried the kimchi fries which were also good. I always plan on trying other stuff on the menu, but whenever I go there I end up getting the kalbi poutine fries. Can't wait to go back and try more!"
"Super yummy tacos! My favs are the chili shrimp and kalbi tacos! The shrimp taco has a nice chili kick into it and the kalbi is nice and savory! The kimchi fried and regular fries are really good too, it's a pretty big portion so it's perfect for sharing with a few friends! The kimchee fries are super filling and enough for a meal own it's own. The regular fries are seasoned well and comes with a white aioli sauce which is absolutely delicious!Def worth a visit if you are around the area and stop by Molly's Cupcakes or BlueMoon Frozen Yogurt afterwards for dessert if you still have room!"
"When a food place is suggested to me by a lot of people, my expectations tend to go higher and the hype gets real.  Most of the time, because of the hype, i often feel let down and leave the food place feeling like something was missing.  This was NOT the case with Del Seoul.  The portions are just right and if you are a fatass like me, you want to try everything they freaking offer.  Definitely try the kimchi fries. We also got the kalbi poutine fries. Both were amazing! We also tried the shrimp, fish and kalbi tacos. Very good as well. Lots of flavors going on and your mouth is having a party on its own.  You and your stomach will leave very happy!"
"Came for a quick bite and we ended up having an amazing meal. Tacos are very tasty and not as spicy as one could have imagined. Service was fast, place very pleasant and and overall great experience. Worth trying!!!"
"We order three tacos. Two of them was some Korean BBQ and one of them was shrimp. The BBQ tacos were great. The meat was flavorful and juicy. The shrimp was not my favorite. It was covered in thousand island dressing or something like it. I don't like thousand island. I might have been able to put up with a tiny bit, but I think the put too much in the taco.I also don't like the restaurant scent. For most people it probably won't be a big deal but for me, I don't like the smell of meat on my clothes. I wish there was better ventilation in there."
"Had Dinner here tonight. Love love love the concept! Place was busy and service was rushed but friendly. We had the Bbq Pork Bahn Mi. Flavorful Meat and the baguette was nice, but not enough of the other good stuff or meat. 2 leaves cilantro, 2 jalapeño slices and just a little pickled Veg. Please charge more and deliver more of everything in the baguette including the meat. Also had Kolbi bento Box. I think I made a mistake ordering this because I love this stuff it just doesn't do well compartmentalized. Salad was a bit of a joke, underdressed, while leaves, and flat. Meat was tasty. -also had kimchi fries. Great idea, tasty stuff, just poorly executed. It needed more kimchi, crispy lardons of the pork belly and less sour cream. No balance for me and a bit flat. That  said I would come back and try some of the other items. Great concept!"
"Heard their Korean tacos were amazing so I just decided to go for their three most popular tacos, which were conveniently labeled on their menu. The service was amazingly fast! We sat down and the food literally came a minute later. I started out with the shrimp taco and was concerned because as someone who likes to finish their meal on the best, I was worried I'd chosen the order wrong! But nonetheless after the shrimp I went for the fish taco which was AMAZING. I'd never seen a fish taco like this which made it all the better, especially since it was fried. The fish also went super well with the toppings and sauce on it. After being super satisfied with that, I finished it off with the kalbi taco. The beef was cooked to perfection and again all the flavors just worked so perfectly. These were definitely among some of the best tacos I've had in my life! My problem with a lot of tacos is the shell, but these were just right in taste and texture. I would definitely come back even just for more tacos, but then I looked around and saw these really good looking steamed dumplings and bowls of something else that looked really good and knew that I would make the effort to come back here sometime. My other favorite taco place in chicago is probably about just as good and a little cheaper, but these were super filling and added a great asian twist to the classic taco."
"I decided to try Del Seoul during my visit to Chicago and I'm so glad I did! My only regret about my visit was not ordering more food. I had the shrimp taco and my boyfriend tried the BBQ pork. Both were really good! My favorite part was the kimchi fries, they are like an explosion of deliciousness in your mouth. I will definitely be back to this place!"
"Whoa, I haven't had fusion chow this good outside of the LA food truck scene!Kalbi, BBQ Pork, and chili shrimp tacos?  Check.  Kimchi fries?  Check.  ""lollipop"" chicken wings?  check.  Friendly staffers, quick service, and a mod atmosphere make me wish they would open one up on the Northshore."
"i first tried korean tacos a few years ago in LA, and have been craving them ever since, and this place certainly hit the spot! the kimchi fries are an amazing concoction! i'm a big fan of fish tacos and their's was on point. also had the spicy bbq pork and the spicy bbq chicken which were delicious as well. fast service and they have a few tables set up right outside which is nice because i take my dog everywhere"
"It could be rather crowded in here during dinner time on the weekends.The fish tacos and tofu tacos are good. I usually get a combination of 2 or 3 tacos for myself for a meal. The galbi tacos are good, I think I get those every time I visit here. I've tried the kimchi fries before maybe a year or two ago and they're okay but not that memorable so I'll have to get them again!"
"This review is not for the food and the quality of it, rather the service.The Hot Stone Bibimbop was yummy and I would have definitely been back, but now... not so sure.I was using a prepaid card and when I asked the cashier how much to put on it, he did not listen. As a result, he swiped it multiple times and now I have negative balance due to all the holds that I have to wait 30 days to clear.A little CS goes a long way."
"My fiancé would not stop bugging me to come to this place as I kept thinking to myself ""who the hell wants Korean tacos"". So we finally went and I have been apologizing ever since. This place is amazing and I don't use that word loosely. Within one bite I was hooked. Don't be dumb like, me try it out!"
"Came here on NYE with my Asian-food loving fiance. I'm not generally a huge fan of Asian food, but I suggested this place because of it's awesome reviews and it's fusion cuisine. I love tacos, so figured this would be more accessible cuisine than a traditional Korean restaurant. After eating there, I feel ready to try other Korean restaurants, because I loved it.Yelp did not steer us wrong! The food was inexpensive, the service was friendly and helpful, and everything was delicious. We ordered the dumplings and the person manning the cashier informed us that it would be about a 15 minute wait because they'd had so many orders come in at once for them. We considered this a sales pitch and were totally happy to eat them when they came out! We also got the Kalbi poutine (thumbs up from me- the fries weren't too soggy and I love that this came topped with sour cream instead of a mayo based sauce), and each ordered two tacos- kalbi and the spicy pork. I loved the slaw that came on top of the tacos, as it added a delicious crunch and was very flavorful.The tacos come standard on corn tortillas, which was fine with me, but they do offer flour tortillas for a .25 cent upcharge, which my fiance would definitely do the next time. This is more of a personal preference for him as opposed to believing this would be a better pairing. We'll certainly be back the next time we're hungry in Lincoln Park (he's still talking about the food, days later), and look forward to trying some other items on their menu.Note that they do serve alcohol, but it's all beer/wine in bottles. This is a pretty low-key environment- pay at the counter, get a number, and they deliver your food to your table as it's ready."
"I love this place for Korean tacos!!! The dumplings/ tofu soup I had there weren't great, not amazing. But your must get their kimchi fries.... They were so delicious! The lollipop chicken is also very good and flavorful! Tacos, fries, and chicken are the way to go at this Lincoln park joint. It's a small space so hopefully you can find a spot during peak hours too."
The food is amazing. It's a must go. The food has so much flavor and it's very authentic.
"So as an educator, I'm told that I always harp on and on about the necessity of 21st century skills.  But the thing is, what I mean by critical thinking skills is basically - please don't be an idiot.  Sadly, such was what I experienced when I tried to order bibimbap without rice.  ME: ""Hi, can I have bibimbap without rice?"" EMPLOYEE:  (Gasp....paired with look of disbelief that someone would try to order something ""different"" than what's on the menu) ""No...I don't think we can do that..."" ME:  ""Well...it's basically your bibimbap bit just don't put the scoop of rice on the bottom""EMPLOYEE:  now consulting a more ""knowledgeable"" co-worker.  ""No, the kitchen won't do that."" ME:  You mean they won't just not put rice? EMPLOYEE:  now scoffing at me--- ""You can talk to my manager if you want..""  I had to walk away.  It's been a while since I've encountered such stupidity.  I wasn't asking them to dramatically alter my dish- just skip the scoop of rice, people! Oh and the rest of the food? Terrible.  Chicken wings were overly sweet and bulgogi was so tough, I swear it's horse meat.  In addition to incompetence, not a single server looked or acted as if they like their job or people in general.  Never again!"
"This seems to be the area for Korean fusion, with crisp and rice n bread a few minutes away (by bike, at least). This is bigger than the other two I mentioned, since crisp is tiny. Service is friendly, although that slows things down a bit. Both of the parties ahead of me talked to the person taking orders for a while, getting pro tips is suppose. That said, once an order was placed, the food was ready very quickly. The staff kept and eye out for larger parties in line, and tried to keep appropriately sized tables open.On to the food. The menu says the shrimp taco is their best, and I think that's likely true, although I haven't tried all of the tacos. It was very tasty. The kalbi was also good, and more filled than the shrimp. A few tacos would be enough food, along with some shared dishes."
"I had two tacos here: sesame chili shrimp ($2.99) and the kalbi ($2.95). Both were tasty, with lots of marinated/tossed lettuce to give a zesty crunch.  I also ordered kimchi fries for my table to share.I dig Del Seoul for their ""novelty"" (they added Kalbi poutine to their menu) and their fusion flavors. In a heartbeat, I would bring a friend to this area just to try Del Seoul, Molly's Cupcakes and/or Aloha Eats... Though not necessarily in that order!My one drawback is that it can get kind of pricey. In my opinion, if you want a semi-filling (taco) dinner here you should at least order 3-4 tacos... Which adds up to around $10-13 bucks NOT including a side of kimchi fries.I like Del Seoul, but kind of wish they would be more generous with their portions, similar to a real tacqueria where a humble meal goes a long way.  Their food is light, not heavy... So afterwards I usually end the night with cupcakes from Molly's (I think a lot of others have this ritual as well).I hate to gripe on the price... Del Seoul is worth it to try at least once.  Their staff is pretty friendly and take your orders efficiently. They crank their tacos out pretty quickly too, even during prime dinner hours on a weeknight . It's a pretty casual environment and you clean up after yourself cafeteria-style.I'd stick with ordering their classic fusion tacos and either their kimchi fries or kalbi poutine.  And you'll easily have room for dessert next door."
"Solid fusion food, really pleasant atmosphere and located super close to Molly's. What more could you ask for?"
"Excellent Korean fusion joint. I was inspired to have a ""Make your own Korean taco"" night at home after eating here. It's all ingredients that we Koreans have at home (you're not Korean if you don't have several jars of fermenting cabbage, aka kimchi, in your fridge). Just pick up some tortillas and you should be pretty set.Anyway, if you've never had Bibimbap and you're looking to order this here -- make sure to get the stone bowl. It takes your rice bowl to a whole other level for an extra $1. I think it's a dollar well spent! The best part of getting the stone bowl is that the bottom of your rice gets nice and crispy. I'm drooling right now just thinking about it...and I didn't even order that on this visit LOL.We ordered a few tacos and the kimchi fries. I wish the fries had more meat in it, but other than that, I loved the flavor and textures. As for the tacos, just get whatever you're in the mood for. They're all good!"
"So good. Will definitely come again whenever we would be back to Chicago!! We tried a variety of tacos, Kalbi bento box, kimchi fries, miso soup and Seoul dumplings. Everything we ate was delicious and up to the hype. Service was fast and courteous. Will definitely recommend this to anyone who loves Korean food. It's not the usual kind but their take on street food Korean is right on mark. Loved it!!!!"
"Had a casual dinner with a friend there.  It's kinda like a fast food chain with Korean food, so don't expect too much service. Some people dine in, while lots of people just order to go. Food was really good. We ordered Bibimbop, street dumplings and fried chicken. All very good. Next time gotta try their fries and tacos - heard great things about them."
"Fast & friendly service. My previous experience at Del Seoul was 3.5 stars with the shrimp taco being the redeemer lifting it from complete meh-dom. So this time around, I didn't have much expectations. Ended up liking all the food that we ordered, made me rethink my original rating for Del Seoul.Kalbi poutine ($9.95) - 4.5 stars. I like cheese, cheese fries, and meat. By that logic, I can only love poutines :D. This poutine was excellent. With each glorious bite, I was thinking of the calories, but also thinking that it was so worth it.Kalbi taco ($2.95) - 4 stars. Delicious.K-town chicken ($9.50 for 8 wings) - 4 stars. Crispy, crunchy goodness. Fan of the sauce. Would be better if the chicken skin/fat layer wasn't as thick.I will be back for the kalbi poutine, fo sho!"
"Perfect meal, galbi tacos and shrimp bahn mi some dumplings and the crema on kimchi fries was OBSCENE. 10/10"
"If you appreciate kalbi, you may be disappointed in these. But for the average person that doesn't eat a lot of Korean food, these will be amazing!However, I strongly suggest the sambal fish tacos, even if you don't like fish. There isn't a fishy taste and it just has a great flavor profile.Kimchi fries are interesting and worth a try. Perfect lunch spot and very good prices."
"The food, the staff were wonderful! Would recommend the shrimp tacos and bento boxes. Price is just right. Everything tasted fresh and good. The only reason why it's a 4 star for me is because parking is hard. A wonderful place like this deserves its own parking lot. But again, hands down to this place!"
"Just...well I cant even find the words. You just need to go. The decor is very fast-food-ish, with a Corner Bakery set up (you order and pay at the counter, they give you a number and then bring the food to you). OH but what food! I had the BBQ Pork bahn-mi, and the pork dumplings. I was so impressed by the complexity of flavors and the freshness of everything. I cant wait to go back and try other things."
Tacos are yum (even Vegetarian). Pork Bento Box is the best. Pork Dumplings are awesome. Anything Pork this place is brilliant..!!
"Great service awesome tacos, kalbi bento box and Bimbibop.  My tummy loves this Korean food, can't wait to go back again :)"
Awesome restaurant! The Korean tacos are really delicious and the kimchi french fries are a must! Tons of flavor and soooo good. There's nothing special about the interior as it's designed to sit as many people as possible.Food Rating:4.5/5Service Rating: 4/5Ambiance Rating: 3/5
I LOVE Del Seoul. Everyone that I've brought to Del Seoul loved it as well. It's just unique and pure goodness. I always pretty much get the same thing: Sesame chili-shrimp and the Kalbi tacos. They are my favorite!
I found the chicken wings a little too sweet and a little bit dry. I have had better.
"Pretty fast in terms of service, similar to Panera where they bring you your order. The Kalbo tacos were very good, and the K-town chicken wings were amazing but SO SPICY! Not for the weak-paletted, and my mouth was kind of numb afterwards. The kimchi fries were very interesting, I've never really had kimchi but it was enjoyable and very different in taste. Would come again!"
Absolutely AMAZING food!! I love this place. Everything is good. The staff is friendly and always willing to recommend something to try. Worth every dollar. Great atmosphere too.
"Hi Everyone. I feel like I have been here, there, and everywhere lately. My friend and I, decided to have date night at this place. We were looking for something authentic and different from the ""norm"". After finding this gem on yep, I thought it was everything my heart could have imagined. Unfortunately, it was more like a hipster inspired Korean bbq -infused restaurant. Although many of the items were authentic, I just didn't get the flare and feel that I felt I would get from the restaurant of its origin. It's more-so a new age version. Then again, I was in the middle of Lincoln park You start by ordering your food from the counter. Don't worry they have all of the traditional favorites such as kimchi,Kimchi rice ,bulgogi & bento boxes. I decided on the bulgogi bento box and it was darn good!! My date went with the bibimbop made in a hot stone bowl. Both were great!   They are no longer BYOB. They do have limited wine & beer available. All and all, I suggest you give it a try!"
"When I was told my friend was taking me to a Korean taco place to dinner I was a little confused, but completely open to trying Del Seoul. I love the name, it's pretty clever, and I love the unassuming location in Old Town. I was really impressed with the food as well. The place is small but had a line out the door when we went a few weeks ago-always a good sign. I would highly recommend the Korean BBQ taco and the chicken wings are out of this world! They have this exquisite glaze on them that gave them almost a candy taste. I really loved everything I had and will certainly be back when I am jonesing for some Asian/Mexican fusion cuisine."
"Reliable, consistently delicious food with great value.  It does get pretty noisy there during peak lunch and dinner hours."
Love all the tacos and the wings and the poutine fries.  I can't eat regular tacos any more!
"I'd always head of Del Seoul as the place to go, if/when you're ever in Lincoln Park; thier kimchi fries were apparently TO DIE FOR. When I tried their food, I understood why. The combination of Mexican and Korean flavors was a beautiful marriage of vibrant and complementary tastes; and I could definitely recognize and appreciate the Korean flair to all their food. Food is 5-start worthy; but the place lost 1/2 star, because you don't get enough food for what you pay (their kimchi fries used to be a lot of food, now I have to order two). Lost another 1/2 star, because of how long their food can take (I've had to wait 30 minutes for my food to come out)."
"I've been a lover of Korean food for a while, but street Korean food was new for me. I had heard of Del Seoul for a while, so I finally got to see what all of the hype was about.We tried a little of everything (dumplings, tacos, Banh-mi sandwich, Kimchi fries). It was all good - everything was full of flavor, pretty cheap overall for how much you get, and a short wait! We decided to eat in - you order at the counter and then they will bring the food out to you as they make it. It's a decent place inside, nothing fancy, but nice. They have takeout and delivery as well.I would definitely come back - those tacos were pretty dang good!"
Unbelievably good kalbi poutine. This is some umami grade stuff here. Everything was fresh and flavorful and the staff was friendly. Reasonably priced for the amount of flavor. Will be back when in town.
"The line to order took a while to move but after eating their food,  it explains why there was a line.  We order 2 awesome shrimp tacos,  a kimchi fried rice and dumplings and it only cost $26 excluding tip. Prices are pretty good for such delicious food.  Everything we had was super flavorful and didn't even need the siracha sauce.  The food didn't taste americanized to me.  Definitely fullfilled my Asian food craving.  The only downside is that it has poor ventilation so you definitely smell like Korean food street you leave but it was well worth it. Definitely will go back again."
Very yummy Korean food. Service was quick and the bill was cheap. I really liked the kalbi tacos. Omg someone in this place has a brilliant mind.
"Absolutely delicious!  My boyfriend is Korean so I was very excited to try this restaurant while vacationing in Chicago.  We ordered the Sesame Chile Shrimp Taco, Kalbi Taco, and a Bulgogi ""Bahn Mi"" Sandwich. All tasted great, wonderful flavors and all meats cooked well. I enjoyed the tacos the most. Would highly recommend all 3 items.  The Sesame Chile was not too spicy, and as Kalbi meat lover, I will say the Kalbi Taco was wonderful as well.Cute place, chill ambiance. You could make it a quick meal or hang out for a bit. Can't wait to go back!"
"The tacos were flavorful! Had the Kalbi taco, BBQ chicken taco, and the shrimp taco and WOW! The Kalbi had this delectable marinade, the BBQ chicken had a sweet/spicy tangy flavor, and the shrimp taco had this rich, crispy, mayo-based saucy flavor. All of these selections went very well with the tortilla, lettuce, and spiced dressing they use in their tacos. We split a Kalbi poutine (fries covered with shredded Kalbi, onions, sour cream, and whatever other deliciousness there was), and it paired very well with the tacos. Prices were fairly decent. Loved the laid-back, street feel of the place. The service was very friendly, and our food came out very quickly!! Loved every detail of our experience dining there!!! Yum yum!"
"Great flavors all around. The Kalbi tacos are to die for. The doors to get into the front with the weatherguard on them is a nightmare. Service can be a little sassy sometimes, other than those things, I love Del Seoul."
"I love this place! I'm vegetarian and have stuck to the Blackened Tofu tacos, and they are amazing. They definitely stuff them with a lot, so two are generally more than sufficient for me (plus, usually they provide two tortillas per taco so I can turn them into four).The place is small and casual, but is well-located, and they also have soy sauce and Sriracha, which only enhance the taco experience."
"My experience here was pretty mediocre. First thing I noticed was they weren't using the AC for some reason. I was really expecting there to be some sauce (gochujang) in my tacos like other korean fusion places I've been to before, but there weren't any. Tacos simply consisted of the meat and lettuce, kind of underwhelming in my opinion. But the meat was flavored very well, so that makes up for it I suppose. This place is good, it's worth a try, but not good enough that I would come back or crave it. There are other Korean fusion places to go to."
"--VEGETARIAN REVIEW--Pros: Great casual Korean fusion place. Loved the laid-back atmosphere and reasonable prices.  Blackened Tofu tacos were amazing!!!!! Cons: Don't see why you wouldn't have a vegetarian option for banh mi, especially when there are vegetarian taco options. Also, the gamja fries were pretty underwhelming although fairly priced. Overall: definitely recommend for both meat eaters and vegetarians but be aware that options may be limited for the latter."
"I love Korean food as much as I love tacos. When I heard about this place, I had to go. I was not disappointed in the slightest, but what surprised me is that the tacos were not my favorite. Yes, the tacos are amazing, get them - any of them (within your dining limitations).But consider the kimchi fried rice. It's admittedly only for those who like kimchi, but if you do, you will be very very happy. It's pretty standard Korean comfort food done fantastically well. Pairs with fries, tacos, and beer.Come hungry and come often."
"I just happened upon this place one day and was pleasantly surprised. Their take on the Banh Mi sandwhich is so creative. I had the shrimp one and it was delicious! I had the fries, which were seasoned well and the aoli was good, but I was disappointed to find out that they were frozen and not fresh. Just a small complaint though! Will definitely eat here again and again."
"I always look forward to coming back to Del Seoul.  During my last visit I was happy to see they expanded their restaurant.  My favorite taco is the Sesame Shrimp Taco (although I do enjoy their Spicy Pork and Galbi tacos as well) and their Kimchi Fries.  I've tried Taco Chino on Kimball, but I definitely prefer Del Seoul as the restaurant is cleaner and they have more options.  I just wish Del Seoul was closer to home!"
"Love this place so much. Their tacos are just so good. Everything there is good! If you never been there, Kimchi fries and shrimp taco are a MUST! I love how it's Korean flavored. If you love beef definitely try their kalbi taco. Usually 3 tacos with a appetizer should fill you up. Chicken taco is about $2.5 each and shrimp taco is about $2.99 each. They are pretty busy most of the time but you can usually find seating for 2-3. You just order and you sit down and they will give the food to you. No waiter. Street parking."
To be honest I've been wanting to try this place out for a while. I read so many great reviews on the tacos and kimchi. I tried the kimchi fries and liked them. But the tacos were not good at all. I was very surprised. I'm not sure if it's because I got them delivered so they didn't taste as fresh but I just wouldn't order them again.  The taco bread didn't taste good and one of the tacos was shrimp and the shell was still on one of the shrimps. I just got kind of grossed out.
"Del Seoul brings Asian fusion food to a whole new level! It has a fast food restaurant vibe, with quick and friendly service. I recommend getting their tacos if it's your first time here! I ordered the fish, galbi, and shrimp tacos. All are priced ~$3. Super cheap for the amount of food you get! The fish taco came with a huge chunk of fried fish fillet topped with yummy cole slaw. The galbi taco came with small slices of meat. It was a bit too salty for my taste, but well-balanced by the cole slaw! The shrimp taco was my FAVORITE (also their most popular taco)! Crispy shrimps with a sweet and savory flavor? Yes please!You cannot go wrong with affordable and delicious Asian tacos!"
"This is actually one of my favorite places to eat out here in Chicago! If it wasn't so far I'd probably be there more often!It's simple, fast, and fulfilling (but not too fulfilling that you can't move the rest of the day)My favorites are the kimchi fries, the sesame-chili shrimp taco, and kalbi taco. I always say I'll try new things when I visit, but I always end up ordering these items!It's a good place to go with friends and hang out. On one visit it was super busy so we had to wait for a table to open up, but the workers worked fast to make it happen. This is one place I'll miss when I move home! :)"
"I can't count how many times I've done the Del Seoul --  Molly's Cupcakes -- Lincoln Park Zoo circuit. It seems like we aren't the only ones who do this--we notice that a lot of the people who eat at the same time as us at Del Seoul make their way to Molly's Cupcakes for dessert after as well! I have never been disappointed here. We like all of the Korean tacos (especially the Kalpi and the Sesame-Chili Shrimp) and the other dishes we've tried (chicken wings and bibimbop). We take all of our friends who visit Chicago to Del Seoul. Service is good and quick --even when they have been very busy with a line almost out the door, as it happened a Saturday this holiday season. On top of that, it's very affordable!I noticed that they delivered the last time I went--hopefully my home is within their delivery radius!"
"Tasteful and spicy little tacos that satisfied my hungry. Ordered the spicy shrimp, fish and kalbi taco that are loaded with spices and napa (korean veggie). Very similar to kogi from LA that started this korean taco craze. My favourite was the spicy shrimp as it was the most unique and flavorful....I did not really enjoy the kalbi as I would have anticipated, the meat wasn't tender and a little bit overcooked....it is a self served place so be prepared to wait for a table....other than that it was great place to satisfied your hungry with delicious saucy tacos"
"This is the BEST taco place in Chicago!  I've never had anything like these before, it's a Korean bbq/mexican fusion type place.  The thing to get here is tacos!  Between the steak, chicken, and shrimp tacos they all have unbelievable flavors, you can't go wrong.  Also the Korean BBQ ones are awesome!  For what you get, these tacos are very reasonably priced.  The meat is quality and they are filling.  I'm usually full after 3 tacos, 4 if I'm really hungry.   The tacos are a little on the small side, but I frankly like that because it allows you try a couple different kinds in one meal.  I haven't tried anything other than tacos here, honestly you don't need to.  The sriracha sauce really complements the tacos as well.  They are so well seasoned that you don't even need sauce, but I usually put a little but of sriracha on for a kick.  Be warned, the line can sometimes be long, especially if you go during the weekend for lunch/dinner but luckily this place is pretty low-key.  You can do take-out and eat them somewhere else.  It's not a typical sit-down restaurant, you go up and order the food and then they'll bring it out to your table number when it's done.  I'd also recommend getting the fries as a side, they are herb fries with a ton of flavor and are pretty good.  All in all, the BEST take-out place in Lincoln Park.  If you want good Korean tacos that will make your mouth happy, this is the place.  I don't know how they put those flavors together."
"I've been perusing yelp for a good korean bbq place for the past few months and finally decided to give Del Seoul a try after seeing quite a few good reviews.I had the Spicy Chicken Bulgogi, Shrimp taco, and kimchi fries. The fries were just as good as yelp reviewers said they were which was awesome. The Shrimp taco was way better than expected, will definitely get this again!The Bulgogi was okay, nothing to brag about and nothing bad about it. I may have just hyped myself up too much for it honestly. The atmosphere was kind of like a quick dine in the area. Definitely not a date night sort of place but great to take friends who want something different in the lakeview area.  Totally wasn't what I expected but that's not a bad thing! I will be returning here!"
"Went to Lincoln Park and decided to give this place a try. With so many delicious options on the menu we over ordered. Kim chi fried rice with spam and eggs served in a hot stone pot was the perfect combo of spicy and crispy. Followed by spicy pork banh mi. Banh mi was a little pricey for banh mi but it was still delicious. Finally we ended it with kalbi tacos and kimchi fries. All very tasty and flavorful. Oh and I almost forgot the best part, they serve beer, cider and wine as well! Great place for a casual lunch or dinner with friends."
"Thank you fellow reviewers on your recommendation to order the shrimp tacos, they were awesome and did not disappoint. Antique taco is still #1 in my book, however this place makes it easy to avoid the tortillas and has more private seating if that's you're thing."
"This place exceeds the hype. Really good, consistent, and creative Korean food."
"They have some great options for gluten free customers, although it's a shame that they don't have a GF option for any of the meat Overall though, food, service and ambiance gets a 4 stars!"
"I ordered the pork tacos which were amazing. The tacos has a great taste and loved the toppings.  The tortilla itself was ok.  If the tortillas were fresh, prob would be some great tacos but overall very goodI ordered the Galbi poutine fries which were good but not the best. Although the meat on the fries was very good. I should have ordered the kimichi fries. I was actually in Seoul in March and there was a Mexican fusion spot that had the kimichi fries with chorizo instead of the pork. They were amazing and wish this spot had the choriZo instead. I liked the spot and would come back. The place was big and was not overcrowded.  The service was good and the food came out within a reasonable time."
"If you like both tacos and Korean food, you'll love this place. The actual restaurant has no shred of pretentiousness. It was fairly packed for an unseasonably cold night. The cashier/hostess girl was really pleasant and funny. The interior has a fast food feel, which was a little off-putting (guess that means I'm a pretentious jerk) until I saw the glorious menu. My boyfriend and I shared 2 shrimp tacos, 2 kalbi tacos, 2 pork tacos, 2 miso soups, and the kimchi fries. It was about $31, and well worth the money. I was so full and so happy. I definitely recommend the shrimp tacos and kimchi fries."
"I've been to Del Seoul multiple times, and while it is not my favorite restaurant in the Lincoln Park area, it is a go to for me when I am craving Korean food. The first time I went, I got the Dolsot Bibimbap, which is a Korean classic, and it came out just as I expected it to. However, after mixing it and trying some, I felt like it was very bland and not as good as other places I have gone to. This was in Winter of 2013.The times after that I have tried the Kalbi taco. The first time I got tacos, I made the mistake of not switching to the flour tortilla. The default is a corn tortilla. I'm not a huge fan of corn tortillas, so it ruined the experience, but it was delicious with a flour tortilla. These tacos are not very big, so you would need to get multiple (~2-3) to make it a meal.The Kimchi fries are also a popular dish. While I like it for the first few bites, the flavors quickly become overbearing and the fries get soggy with all of the kimchi, sour cream, cheese, etc. Even though these are fries, it's definitely recommended, if not necessary, to eat with a fork.My favorite dish is the Bulgogi Banh Mi sandwich. I love the pickled radishes and the baguette. I went today and actually saw a lot of people have ordered the sandwich, so it must be getting more popular. If you've never had a Banh Mi (Vietnamese style sandwich) before, I would recommend trying it! I've had some in Argyle, and the Bulgogi one from Del Seoul is very similar and just as enjoyable. What's also neat is they sell jars of Kimchi at a reasonable price, which I think is great if you don't have an H-Mart or other Korean market around."
"I am a lover of the poutine, so naturally I had to get the Kalbi Poutine. Who would have thought this little bundle of Korean-Canadian joy would have been so appetizing? Other all-star picks: pork bahn mi and sesame-chili shrimp tacos. Bonus for kimchi fans: you can take a jar home so the journey doesn't have to end when you leave."
"Finally got to try this place, and wasn't disappointed. It's a fairly predicable meal - I'm betting you can already imagine what a Korean taco would be like if you've had Korean food before.I'd say definitely get the Sesame-chili Shrimp taco - best thing I had here! And of course get the Kimchi fries to share. If you get the Bibimbop - get it in the stone pot. Helps you get that rice crispy."
"Ordered take out which included the new kalbi poutine. On the way to pick up my food, 15 minutes later, they called to tell me they ran out of french fries over the weekend. Thanks for letting me know so late. Regardless, the food is pretty good. The k-town wings have a delicious crispy glaze and its kinda sweet and topped with sesame seeds. These are delicious! I was concerned about take out wings, they usually get soggy, but these were perfect. I'd like to try Crisp and compare the two wings.Ordered one of each taco. They are huge! Favorites were the kalbi (such good flavor), pork, and shrimp (although the shrimp was skimpy. But delicious breading and sauce.) The spicy chicken and fried fish were good but didn't have as much flavor as the others."
Best fish and shrimp tacos in Chicago - i recommend ordering 2 shrimp tacos and just 1 fish taco because the fish tacos are huge!!!
"I'm such a creature of habit and order the same thing every time I come here, but it never disappoints.  Every time I have visitors, I have to take them to Del Seoul!Our favorites are the shrimp tacos and kimchi fries.  Every thing is decently priced for being in Linkin Park and the restaurant is clean.  My only recommendation is to just try a few things here, like a mid-day snack, rather than choosing to eat here for a full meal.  I think they definitely have a few things they're good at, and that's what keeps me coming back."
"Interesting. Very casual and nothing fancy but food was very good. Korean fusion tacos and sandwiches. Great  idea and reminds me of the popular Food Truck. Grab a Quick bite at a low cost. If you are not a fan of tacos they had long list on things on their menu from dumplings to korean bibimbap, korean spicy soup and kimchi fries( kimchi on french fries with cheese). Highly recommend."
"Awful experience.   The quality has gone downhill.   Air Conditioner wasn't working and instead of putting signs up saying it is not working, they allowed hordes of people in the restaurant taking in sales without telling customers that it is an armpit in there.   Every table was sweating including the wait staff.     Same day, the dish comes with three or four small pieces of steak in the bidimbop dish they tout as recommended.   Kitchen was also off bigtime.   When told to the manager Shawn, his reply - sorry but there is nothing I can do.   Well buddy, here is one star for your shitty service.   Better go back to the glory days when you guys were good portions and nice atmosphere."
"I've been to Del Seoul a few times for lunch in the afternoon. The service is pretty quick and the place is fairly small. I find it a little pricey, but unless you go to a hood joint it seems like most tacos are being priced around $3.00.The tacos are delicious and have a different taste from the taco's I normally get elsewhere. They call it Korean Street BBQ. I normally order three taco's when I go: Sesame-Chili Shrimp, Kalbi (beef Short rib), and the spicy BBQ Chicken. My favorite is the Sesame-Chili Shrimp. It tastes a little sweet. On my last visit I also tried the Kimchi Fries, which were basically like a Poutine. They were pretty good. The next time I go though I plan on trying their Kalbi Poutine or the seasoned Gamja fries with Aioli sauce. I love Aioli dipping sauce, so I'm sure they'll be delicious!"
Awesome Korean tacos.  Kim chi good.  Really love this place.  It's casual.  A place to drop in.  Can even carry out.
"Just happened to check this place out on our visit to Chicago for some birthday celebrations. Wow. First off, we don't have great Korean food where I live so this was refreshing. All the reviews on how good the tacos are were on point! Kalbi and spicy pork are . They put them in these little corn tortillas (which generally I don't care for) that complimented them well. The kimchi fried rice was good....can't say anything amazing but it was tasty. Kimchi fries....yuuuuum! I had seen all of the pictures and wasn't really sure what the white sauce was but turns out it is a sour cream of some sort (Mexican crema?) nonetheless that mixture with kimchi and scallions on top was one I'll remember from this trip! Wings, they were good as well but again nothing too wow in my opinion. The steamed dumplings...meh. So all in all this place was a great first dinner experience in this big beautiful city!! We had a group of 5 and they were able to accommodate is no problem. If you are around the area or visiting and enjoy some Korean flavors...check this place out! It was worth it!"
"Del Seoul has a great menu of Korean Mexican fusion. The food was good, but it didn't blow me away. I was expecting a lot more based on the yelp reviews. I tried:Sesame-Chili Shrimp taco (this was my favorite)Kalbi taco (the beef was unpleasantly chewy)Spicy BBQ pork taco (I didn't find it spicy)I think I wasn't impressed because my food came out ~10min before my friends and I politely waited for her food to arrive before eating, so it was room-temp and the taco shells were soggy. I will definitely come back, because I want to give Del Seoul another shot- the kimchi fried rice is calling my name."
"Really great tacos and kimchi fries. Those shrimp tacos were in my mind for days. A little bit expensive, but every bite is worth it!"
"I've been here a couple of times now. The tacos were pretty good, but I didn't find them mind-blowing. I'm not sure if this is a fair comparison, but I liked Big Star's taco more. Everything else was pretty much standard Korean that you can find at other good ""fusion"" korean places (i.e. Belly Shack). I don't think I would ever crave something from Del Seoul, but I'll stop by for a quick meal if I'm in the area.Oh, and for some reason, they're not BYOB. I guess I just take BYOB at places like this for granted."
"Don't go here thinking that you'll get standard Mexican fare or some Americanized pan-Asian food.  The menu is totally unique and takes a little time to digest.  I really liked the food I got here.  The wait was moderate, but worth it."
"Is the food delicious and unique? Yes!Is the staff friendly and accommodating? Yes!Have I gotten vicious, weekend ruining food poisoning from two different types of said delicious food on two separate occasions?  Yes.This used to be one of my favorite go-to lunch spots since I work nearby, and I gave them a pass after the first time, but now I can't even think about it without getting nauseous.Be afraid....Be very afraid."
"Casual take-out setting with no alcohol license. Their fried fish taco is incredible with the pickled onions that totally make it. These are generous and heavily breaded, making them filling, so just get 1 and mix/match with other items. Also tried the dumplings and was not too impressed.... The starch was too sticky, so it ripped apart from the steam pot liner when trying to eat. Flavor was so/so, but perhaps they should try making alternate dumpling fillings and try perfecting the steam time, as a great dumpling is hard to find."
"The bibimbap and bulgogi here are amazing. I order one or the other every time I come. I tried the spicy BBQ pork and kalbi tacos, which were also very good. They're a little small for the price, but I'm probably just being greedy and want more ;-)The only thing that kept me from giving Del Seoul a 5 star rating were their kimchi fries. I was so excited to try them and was SOOOOOO disappointed by them. The pork belly topping was nonexistant and there was way way way way way too much sour cream. Totally inedible."
"This place made me realize how much I love Korean Mexican fusion. It works so well together! You can't say that about a lot of other ethnicities regarding fusion fare. I've tried all the tacos, and they're all delicious, but my favorites are the shrimp and kalbi! The kimchi fries are great, and I saw that they had a new item - poutine fries with kalbi. I'll have to try that next. The street style dumplings are super tasty, and honestly, I don't think anything on the menu is bad. I almost always come here if I have time, and I'm visiting Chicago. I wish there was one in Columbus!"
"Amazing tacos!  Highly recommend the shrimp and Korean BBQ ones. The pork dumplings are worth a try as well.  This is a small little place, but makes up for it in a tastey way!  Great staff that are fun and engaging."
"I have been here twice and this review is based on my second experience here.  The first experience I ordered 4 tacos to go and after 40 minutes, the tortilla did not hold up to well.  I just remember the shrimp taco being delicious though.  I cannot give a review based on that though!The second time I went I ordered 1 shrimp taco, bulgogi banh mi, hot stone bowl bibimbop, and kimchi fries.  The shrimp taco again was delicious and the tortilla was perfect this time since I ate it right away.  The bulgogi banh mi was okay.  The pickled carrot and daikon was right on and I liked the bread, but it was the bulgogi that lacked flavor.  It was not worth $6.95 is what I mean and I am used to banh mi that are $3-$4 that are delicious!  The bibimbop also lacked flavor and I had to add sriracha to compensate for that.  The kimchi fries were good, but for 2 people it was very heavy so I recommend it for 3 or more people.Overall I would defintely come back for the shrimp taco.  And I will try some other things on their menu next time too but I am kind of afraid since some of the things were misses for me.  Between 2 people it was almost $30 for lunch.  The service is quick and it is in a nice location so I would recommend this place to people but just for the tacos!"
"Went there 2yrs ago and was just talking to my frd about their kimchee fries! Pretty amazing! The restaurant has Korean food and korean&american fusion food. It's a quick counter service with a decent amount of space. A little out of reach if you are in Chicago traveling staying in the travel hotspot, but definitely a good place for a quick bit!"
"I love this place! Definitely get the shrimp tacos they are amazing! As well as the dumplings, and their seasoned fries!They also just started serving beer!"
"For Korean fusion food this place is pretty good, but again, after having Korean fusion food from California, this place is ""meh"". The food was expensive for what you get. For example, I ordered dumplings. It was $8 and they only gave you 8 small dumplings they you can literally get from the store! You can get a 3lb bag of 30+dumplings for that same amount! The taco's were delicious but also overpriced. Not to be a stickler or anything but if they dropped the price of their tacos by $1, then the price would be reasonable. (Note I said ""reasonable"" and not ""good"")"
Decent portions and good food. Definitely lives up to the hype. They didn't have AC though which is a necessity for that Chicago summer weather
"Love, Love, Love this place. Never had Korean BBQ but they definitely was an easy transition. My favorite is the shrimp tacos. I recommend eating there because the food does not taste well reheated."
"Best Korean Mexican fusion I've had so far in the Chicago and Champaign areas. It was a bit busy but we didn't  have to wait long for a table. It looks like it can get fairly crowded at times.I can't eat cilantro so I had my shrimp and kalbi tacos without their cilantro and onion mixture. They still tasted pretty good without it! The kalbi taco had a good balance of flavor, but the shrimp in the shrimp taco was fried so it added this greasy flavor.Their kimchi fries were so good! Its fries, cooked kimchi and pork, with cheese and green onions. Simple and good korean flavors mixed with a simple side like fries. Simple and amazing, definitely try it!"
"The best Korean street food around. I love the hot stone bibimbap. The dumplings are amazing, as are the tacos. The spicy chicken is really spicy- consider yourself warned!"
"I love this place. Seriously. Peter and his clan know what they are doing. The only bad thing about this place for me is that it is farther north and hard to find parking. Which actually may be a good thing cause if I could swing by this place nightly to grab some spicy pork tacos on a nightly basis, I probably would. And I'd have kimchi coming out of my, well, fridge since they make some good stuff. If you haven't been here and are looking for a different tasty treat, do yourself a favor and stop by. Try one of each taco. My wife loves the Banh mi sandwiches and we both dig the kimchi fries. I've been told I need to try the Kimchi Fried Rice which comes with rendered down spam. Yes, you heard me (or read correctly), I've heard it is delicious. And you really can't argue with a 100 year old recipe of street dumplings. Right? Anything that has lasted a 100 years HAS to be worth trying. No liquor license yet, but that is in the works. What you can pick up here though is a bottle of Sriracha to take back home. A bottle of that and a jar of kimchi, now you are almost Korean."
"This one of my favorite take out places in Chicago!  I moved to a different neighboorhood but still drive up here for their delicious tacos and kimchi fries. I usually call about 10-15 minutes before heading up there and they have it ready for me.  Admittedly, I almost never eat in the restaurant so I can't speak to the dining experience.The best things on the menu are the kimichi fries (love!), shrimp taco, and spicy tofu hotpot (this is a  bit more of a traditional Korean dish)."
"I had bibimbap with beef, and except for the sprouts (way too much of them) it was really tasty. I especially liked the shitake mushrooms. The rice was a bit mushy though. Portion size was alright, could have been a bit  bigger for the price."
"Delicious Fast and Friendly.Boyfriend and I ate here, we spit the Kimchi fries (loved but eat fast or they get soggy)I ordered the Kalbi Bento Box and an Allagash WhiteHe ordered the Spicy BBQ Pork Bahn Mi with a Nitro Milk Stout.Food came fast and all was delicious.The Kabli had a ton of flavor (if a little chewy) and so did the BBQ pork but he mentioned he would order the tacos next time as he felt that there was too much bread-to-meat on his sandwich.Overall great food in a unique setting."
"The tacos here are pretty great. The flavors are complex and the quality of the ingredients is also something I appreciate. Of note - who knew that spam could taste so good?!? The only thing meh I'd mention is that dining in can be a bit much, as it can be crowded. I've actually gone elsewhere because of it. When in doubt, just have them deliver."
"Great fusion restaurant in Lincoln Park. Went around 8 on a Friday night, line wasn't too long and wife and I were seated upon ordering. Service was nice, they bring the dishes out for you individually as they're prepared. Sesame chili shrimp taco was delicious, kalbi taco was so-so. K-town wings were awesome, reminded me of Great Sea's lollipop wings but not as spicy. Fries order was a little small but the aioli sauce made up for it. Definitely worth a visit."
"This place puts the yummy in my tummy! The portions are perfect and the spices are just right. We usually get the Kimchi Fries, the Shrimp Tacos and the Veggie Rice Bowl. The shrimp is cooked to perfection and the seasoning on the fries is mouth watering.Definite go to place!"
"First time at del Seoul, amazing food from the start very customer service orientated. All the employees seem to know the menu inside and out with with much enthusiasm. I was recommended the shrimp tacos by employee josh. Much appreciated! We will be sure to come back !"
SHRIMP TACOS AND KIMCHI FRIES. All you need to order and you will be satisfied. So freaking delicious
I went here twice with my friends up in the Lincoln park neighborhood. They got great tacos and appetizer. You order what you want and they just bring it over you. Each time I went it is pack with a long line. This is a great take out place and I have yet to back again and I always like going up to neighborhood since they have so many places to try and I am so happy I went to this place. I would recommend this place to my friends.
"The good here is delicious. Mixing Korean style dishes with other styles may sound odd, but this place pulls it off quite nicely. I recommend this place if you are in the mood for something new and exciting. I love you America, the end."
"First of all, let's all take a moment to appreciate the name. The pun is so witty and describes this Mexican-Korean fusion restaurant perfectly! Considering that this is an Asian restaurant, there were very few Asians there but the food was still pretty authentic in my opinion.Ordered the Sesame Chili Shrimp Taco, Kalbi Taco, and Blackend Tofu Taco. They were all pretty tasty, but the Sesame Chili Shrimp taco was the clear winner. Definitely a must try!I went for dinner on a weekend and it was too crowded and the service was quick. Enjoyable experience overall!"
"I literally fly in to Chicago and go straight to Del Seoul to get the short rib tacos and chicken wings, soooooo good!"
Not much in decor but the kimchi cheese fries are something I'll never forget. How come someone hasn't brought this dish to NY yet?!  The flavor combo of kimchi and cheese over salty soft texture of potato just works!We also ordered the tofu bowl but I found the broth to be a bit thin and watery. I like my soup to be thick and stewy like it's been cooking on a stove for hours. There were so many other items I wanted to try but it'll have to wait for next time!
"I wanted to try this place out because it has pretty good reviews on yelp.  The best way to describe this place is street food not on wheels.  It's modern truck food with flares here and there.  Overall, the food is very tasty.  We had the street dumplings.  They were  kinda dry but flavorful.  It is cute how it comes in a steam container with a silicone mat.  Down side, the dumplings stuck to the silicone mat.  I tried two tacos, the Spicy BBQ Pork and the Shrimp Taco.  The Spicy BBQ Pork was nothing special.  The shrimp one was good.  I liked the sauce and flavors.  I also tried the Bulgogi Banh Mi.  The Bulgogi was good and it was different eating it in Banh Mi form.  A lot of flavors marrying together.  Overall, the food was good.  I am intrigued to try the Poutine....essential carne asada fries.We ate this before working out.  I must say, bad idea!  All the burping and flavors coming up is not work out friendly."
"This is one of my favorite places in the city.Pros:1. Shrimp tacos: Amazing if served hot. Sometimes they come out cold though.2. Fish tacos: Probably some of the best fish tacos I've had3. Kalbi Poutine: Very inventive and very tastyCons:1. Service: This place is run by nice people, but they are very inefficient. Sometimes there will be huge lines, but there will be 3-4 employees standing behind the counter talking with each other casually. 2. Food temperature: The food quality has declined a bit over the past year. Sometimes the food now arrives luke-warm or even cold."
"After eating at Del Seoul a few times, we've noticed that the tacos have gotten smaller. What happened? The flavors are on point, but the portion size leaves much to be desired.  The kimchi fries are also slightly underwhelming. The fries lose their texture with all the kimchi and toppings piled on. And that's certainly not an indictment on putting delicious toppings on fries because that's usually a hit. Maybe we just got unlucky with our order, but the fries weren't as crisp as we'd have liked. Del Seoul is definitely worth a trip to try out their generally tasty Korean tacos. Just don't expect a full meal here, unless of course you order half the menu."
"Korean Mexican fusion?  KoMex?  Oh, but they also have Kalbi Poutine... Korean Canadian fusion?  KoCan?  Whatever, just try it.Went here for the first time on a weekday night.  Had to drive around a little bit to find street parking but it wasn't too bad.  Walked in around close to 9pm and almost all of the tables were taken.  Luckily some people were leaving so we were able to get a table right away.I ordered the shrimp, kalbi, and bbq pork tacos and the dumplings.  My boyfriend ordered the K-Town wings.  Let me tell you, I wish I just got ALL shrimp tacos because they were so good.  But since it was my first time there I wanted to try a variety of things.  The kalbi was cooked nicely, not too chewy,  The BBQ pork was pretty basic.  The dumplings were also good, but nothing life-changing.  I tried one of my boyfriend's wings and they were nice and crispy.  Sauce was also good.Ambiance was cool.  Had a chill, urban feel to it.  Great place to hang out and eat good food.  I'm definitely going to come back and try more of what's on the menu.  The bento dinners look amazing and the Kalbi Poutine seems to be a must try.  I held back on trying their kimchi fries, mostly because i recently had the kimchi fries from bopNgrill for the first time and they were so good there.  But next time I'll give them a try.  Because pork bellies."
"I know everyone loves this place and I'm going against the trend here with a less than stellar review, though I will say that it is a good solid joint and an interesting Korean fusion fast food concept.  I get that I'm not the customer demographic they are targeting with their offering. I don't get what all the hype is about this place as far as the food is concerned.  Maybe I didn't order the right stuff.  Otherwise, for an inexpensive fast food joint it's on trend with today's fast casual bold global flavor preferences, especially Korean which is has been the ""in-ethnic"" cuisine for the past few years. Glad to see someone taking it mainstream. I ordered the sesame chili shrimp, kalbi beef and pork tacos, all of which were good but tasted similar once the vegetable topping and sauce were added. I would have preferred more flavor differential but I get that with a fast food concept you need to trade off a certain amount of customization for the speed that comes with standardization of food, toppings and ingredients.  The soft taco shells were cold, again good, but I would have preferred them room temperature to slightly warm.  The traditional boring soft drink machine was a little old school. While they have a few good global beverage choices, I would have preferred some other more hip beverage offering, juice drinks, maybe bubble tea, milk tea, maybe even flavored Shaved Ice like they do in Japan or Taiwan for dessert or something. If you're looking for something different and on trend in cheap eats or are coming out of a bar this place is solid.  For real Korean tastes and flavors, best go somewhere else."
My favorite tacos in the city! Their dumplings are fantastic too.
"Nice and casual atmosphere. Quick service. Amazing food! Wasn't sure what to expect at first, but the YELP reviews helped me decide what items to get.We ordered the Street Style dumplings, Shrimp tacos, Kalbi Poutine, and BBQ Pork Bnah Mi. All really flavorful and delicious. I'm obsessed with the Poutine and shrimp tacos though...so tasty! I'll def be coming back for more:)"
"I love this place. Everything I have gotten is great. My favorites are the short rib poutine,  garlic chili  shrimp tacos,  or bhan mi, the fish tacos are great. Pretty much the best Korean fusion food around.  The door is Jenkie in the winter if you have a stroller beware."
"This is a review for delivery. They said 1.5 hours on the phone but they came in half an hour. We ordered at about 10 pm. The kimchi fries were outstanding, definitely order this. They have fried cheese and some sort of heavy dipping sauce on top with chives. We also got the dumplings which were good but not outstanding and the pork BBQ bento box. I liked this a lot, the flavors were interesting, not too sweet or spicy and had a smoky edge that I liked."
The shrimp tacos are phenomenal!
I am slightly ashamed at how I've been here at least five times and each time I get the exact same thing. The sesame-chilli shrimp and kalbi taco - always delicious. Some time in the near future (or far future tbh) I will eventually try their banh mis and hot plates. Their korean tacos are always a good bet - although - I haven't had the ones from LA's food trucks so perhaps my 4 stars is a little biased on this end. PS: Get the kimchi fries! It's good for sharing 2-3 people. Molly's cupcakes is also a few doors down. Great area.
I had the sesame chili shrimp and kalbi tacos. Shrimp was on point and very flavorful. Tha kalbi on the other side was way too chewy and not tender at all. Also had the gamja fries and that was good. Will be back to try other items on the menu!
"This place rocks great food, fast and friendly service.  Good eats great for families.  I love the shrimp tacos delicious."
best. fish/shrimp tacos. ever. that is all.
Quality food. Absolutely fresh ingredients
"Okay, okay... this place is awesome.I stumbled in here with a friend several months ago, but having eaten already that day, I was only able to try a chicken taco and swore I would return to live out the full experience. Last night, I got that full experience in all its glorific abundance.I had the fish tacos, which were insanely flavorful, zesty, and fresh. They're wrapped in a really fresh and hearty soft shell, and topped with mounds of meet, pickled onion, greens, and a spicy/tangy aioli that lingers to the next bite.I also tried the kalbi poutine--HOLY COW (literally). It's a little wrong how much delishfully marinated meet is piled on top of this mound of savory french fries, with a white (cheese?) sauce that just melts in your mouth. Whatever they put in that white sauce, there must be a touch of crack. And the french fries are a perfect crispy texture for the intoxicating mix.I also tried the pork dumplings, which are probably not the strongest menu item, but tasty nevertheless.Seriously though, whoever thought to take tacos and magically infuse a Korean twist was a culinary genius. And should win the nobel prize for geniusness. No joke--a heavenly combination."
"Whoops.. we went on Saturday night.Had walked past this place and it was always packed plus it had great reviews here so we decided to give it a try. When we went inside it was so smokey that it was hard to breath, we had to shower when we got home to wash the smell of us. We orderd the Pork bento box and a few tacos. The tacos were not bad, but if you ever been to the taco joint or antique taco, don't bother with these. The bento box was flat out bad... just lazy, sloppy food with no care taken to what is being served to customers. The meat was inedible due to it being so tough... the salad was ok.. but the best part was the rice, so that's saying a lot. There are so many good food places in Chicago that why would you bother with this place."
"Om nom nom, this place is good. I ordered take-out from here a couple weeks ago with my friend, and we were really pleased. We ordered online, and the order was ready in about 10 minutes, which was awesome. We ordered the kimchi fries, Sambal Fish tacos and Kalbi tacos, and everything was delicious. The price is also very affordable too. I'm lucky to live so close! Highly recommend!"
"THE BEST.(Like I said before, that's all that really needs to be said about this place)Nothing on their menu will disappoint you. Everything tastes amazing. Especially their shrimp tacos. Each taco is huge, and it really is the size of two tacos anywhere else."
"I literally live at this place!  Soooo delicious. A little expensive, but absolutely worth it! Shrimp taco's, kalbi and fish taco's are BOMB.com!"
"I am loving Del Seoul for its shrimp tacos and fries! I can't wait to come back and try more options, but will definitely be making these shrimp tacos a staple. The asian slaw here is spot on to the point that I'd eat just that for a meal. Tangy, sweet, refreshing, and crisp mix of greens goes great with the flavors of the proteins. The service is fast and low key. Next time I'm dining by myself, I'll be coming here."
"I LOVE THIS PLACE.To be completely honest, I had never had Korean style food in my life. After eating here, I may have to explore more into that realm.My top two favorite items so far have to be the kimchee fries and the BBQ pork banh mi sandwich. The fries are super crisp and fresh, and everything about the banh mi is absolutely perfect. I'm going to go as far as saying that it's probably better than anything I've ever gotten near Argyle. Yeah. it's that good. The french bread is crusty on the outside and soft on the inside, the meat is flavorful, and they pack it with all the typical banh mi veggies.Large portions, decent prices, amazing food."
"Finally, I made it to Del Soul, the Korean Fusion restaurant in Lincoln Park! It was everything I have always wanted! On the menu was:Sesame-Chili Shrimp: It was a panko shrimp with a cilantro-onion relish , a sesame chili aioli and a slaw made of napa cabbage and carrots. It was amazing! The shrimp was crispy and flavored with the sesame and the corn tortillas were a great complement to it. Kimchi Fries: NOM NOM NOM OMG these were absolutely amazing!!! The fries just by themselves were freshly fried and crisp. Then they covered it with a sauteed Kimchi, onion and pork belly slaw, sour cream, cheddar and jack cheese with some scallions. I went to heaven. K-Town Chicken Wings: The lollipopped crispy chicken wings were covered in a sweet soy, chili glaze and there were 8 huge pieces. Crystal and I died trying to finish all of it. If you have the chance to come here, do it because it is a greatly priced restaurant and food is top notch!"
"First venture into Korean cuisine. Flat out amazed. Kimchi, BBQ short ribs, pork belly, and bibimbap. Layers of flavor, crazy colors and textures. The dishes were unbeatable, I would eat the entire menu!"
"Del Seoul is... Well... It's a religious experience. The poutine fries, the tacos, the kimchi.... It's truly amazing. They also serve booze now. If only I didn't live 45 minutes away!"
"After seeing the good yelp reviews, I decided to give Del Seoul a try last week. Great food and friendly service. I particularly enjoyed the kalbi tacos. They are reasonably priced and delicious. I look forward to returning!"
"Great place to grab a quick bite for a reasonable price, and not to mention that at that reasonable price you are getting exceptional food. My favorite items include: ALL the tacos, mainly the shrimp taco, gamja fries and the K-town chicken wings mm mmm mmmm! It's one of those places that I like to take people who come in from out of town and haven't tried something as unique as this."
Wow - don't know where to begin. Maybe shorter is better here. Everything here is unreal. Not joking. Wings. Tacos. Kimchi fries. Beer.  Just go.
"This place was so good I joined YELP to make a review. This is officially my first review ever. I visited Chicago for 48hrs to see a friend and I ended up eating here three times. I have tried all of their tacos, kimchi fries, Kalbi poutine, chicken wings, and dumplings. I loved them all. My favourites were the shrimp tacos and Kalbi tacos. I'll definitely come back every time I visit the Windy City. Plus the staff is super attractive and friendly. Will be back to try the rest of the menu!"
Food was great we ordered the kalbi tacos and the kimchi rice the shrimp tacos and dumplings which were amazing. Service was ok. You have to order up front and they bring it to your table. More of a self serve place. They very quick so its a great place to stop for a quick a lunch. Not a great place for kids or strollers! But food was great!
I don't think there's anything on the menu that's not solid! Lots of flavor in every bite. Price is reasonable too. Shrimp tacos are my favorite. But try the others as well!
"Ok, I have to admit. I was a little bit... no a LOT a bit hesitant to try this place.  My husband and our friends actually walked in about a month after the restaurant opened out of curiosity-  ""Korean mixed with Mexican food... sounds... Unique??""  As we searched the menu on the HD screens they have above the cashiers, we got confused about the choices, it went from tacos to bim bop to dumplings to miso soup.  As usual, I panicked and we decided to eat somewhere else that was ""safe"" that night.Now, we live about a block away from Del Seoul so we are constantly going by this place.  As months passed we watched people lining up to go in the place and eat.  We read 5 star Yelp reviews.  We watched Del Seoul have to buy the empty store next to their restaurant and have to expand due to their popularity.  Finally, take two: My husband and I decided it was a must try.  Being a pescatarian, I ordered the shrimp tacos and the gamja fries while my husband tried a few different types of tacos.  We sat down and waited about 5-10 minutes for our food to be freshly prepared.  When our food was brought to our table it was piping hot and the tacos were over-flowing with food (you will need a fork to eat up what falls out).  One bite and I was in Korean-Mexican food heaven!  The sauces are the perfect compliment for the battered and fried shrimp and other fillings!  The gamja fries are good but the garlic dipping sauce makes them amazing.  My husband liked the other tacos he tried but enjoyed the shrimp tacos the best.Fast forward to today.  I am so happy I live only a block away from Del Seoul!  We go to this restaurant or order carry out about once a month.  Our friends and family constantly request it when they visit from out of town.  Their carry out service is quick.  If you're in the neighborhood and want to try some delicious fusion food, look no further and try the tacos here!!  My only recommendation for improvement is that the restaurant becomes a BYOB..."
"A popular little joint  in the lincoln park area, servicing all those who want yummy korean food...but on tacos.The tacos were amazing. They remind me of the first time I tried korean tacos, which was in socal from a foodtruck. The shrimp and pork and kalbi were all good options for eating the tacos, but I was a bit underwhelmed with the kimchee fries. I didnt care for the cheese on it but did like the sour cream topping on those. Overall, food was a bit salty but I did enjoy the various tacos that we tried.Looking for parking for 40 mins was a pain in the BEEhind. I think that ruined my experience a bit, but the tacos made it better."
This review is solely based on the delicious fries I just ate. But even more the playlist was really cool  I was on my way out but then here some Marley cuts from Soul Rebel   and decide to sit and chill for a minute.  The music was really chill I would love to listen to a Del Seoul playlist
"Mmmmm tacos. Great little Korean place. Came here a couple of days ago and got the fish, shrimp, kalbi, and chicken tacos. Started off with an order of dumplings which were pretty good. Solid but not blow you away kind of dumplings. The tacos were absolutely delicious though. Packed with flavor they were all topped with the cilantro onion relish which provided a nice crunch to the tacos and helped balance out the flavor of them. The fish taco was topped with a slaw and was in a flour tortilla unlike the other tacos. The fish was fried nicely with a good amount of batter and it had a very nice kick to it. The shrimp taco was ok I felt, just not as much flavor as the fish and the kalbi and the chicken taco was ok as well. Overall I really like this place, solid tacos that are worth the price and I'll definitely be coming back for more"
"I eat here an absurd amount. (I live nearby).Try the sesame-chili shrimp taco, bulgogi bento, and kalbi poutine. YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"
"They have the best shrimp taco in the whole world. There is no reason to eat any other taco. If this restaurant was in Douglas Park, I'd take the bus there at night to get some food. It's that good."
"Great place for quick & ""no BS"" Korean tacos and some basic Korean staples.  It's always packed when I'm here; but the service is relatively quick (unless you've ordered a Bento box dinners) and the table wait isn't too bad.Taco recommendations: Sesame- Chili Shrimp; Blackened TofuBento Box recommendation: Spicy BBQ PorkIf you're feeling gluttonous (or don't care about calories), splurge on the Kalbi Poutine (french fries topped with short ribs, gravy, cheese, scallions & pickled red onions)"
"A great nuevo-Korean cuisine and relatively inexpensive neighborhood Lincoln Park restaurant. The menu includes popular and standard Korean dishes, albeit with a modern contemporary flare along with fusion dishes like Korean tacos and French Fries with Korean toppings and flavors. I would liked to try a lot more things on the menu, but between my girlfriend and I, we split:- A plate of Seoul Style Street Dumplings ($7), 8 good sized dumplings. Perfect appetizer even for larger groups.- Miso Soup, pretty solid (hard to mess up a Miso Soup if you ask me)- Bulgogi BBQ Plate ($10), came with a salad and rice. A good sized portion enough for the two of us (i.e. with the dumplings). Great flavor, highly recommended. Will definitely be back for more."
"Aside from the very awkward entrance/exit doors, this place is a gem.- Kimchi fries: yummmm. Some of the crispest fries I've had and not over-smothered with flavorful kimchi, sour cream, and various other light toppings.- AMAZING fish tacos. The outside was extremely crispy but the fish filet falls apart so delicately. Toppings added the perfect amount of spicy.- Kalbi tacos were also on point... loved the corn tortilla and the meat is tender, juicy, and bursting with flavorful marinade.A unique take on Korean/Mexican fusion and reasonable prices too!"
"I tried different Korea food, most of them are healthy, which means less oil, not much salt. I tried different sandwich and other soups in the store. They are not traditional, but modified Korea  food, with much oil and salt. It is good place for people would like to have some greasy style food after long time on diet.They need to improve the customer service as well, twice they forgot to put in the orders for my friends, so we had to wait a bit longer."
"This placed reminded me of the Kogi Truck in California, but better!After reading all the reviews about this place, my family and I decided to take the train and walk to this place (about 3 miles all together). We were all drained out and tired from the walk, but it was SO WORTH IT!The food here was so flavorful and scrumptious!!!! IWe ordered the Kalbi Poutine, Kalbi Tacos, Banh Mi and the Chicken Wings. Oh my, writing this makes my mouth water, but sadly I won't be back anytime soon :(. I'm so sad!!!If I ever do return to Chicago, this will definitely be the first place that I would run back to again! I will/ do not mind walking those long distances for the delicious food!YUMMERS, I hope we meet each other soon...again"
"After 1000+ reviews, this place hardly needs more affirmation... but here goes. People sitting inside with delicious looking steaming dumplings in front of them is what prompted us to enter the place. I was disappointed that they dont have veggie version of their dumplings. I ordered the shrimp banh mi, hubby got the blackened tofu veggie tacos and a side of gamja fries. The fries were delicious, crisp and addictive. They were dusted with Korean spices and came with a garlic aioli dip. The shrimp banh mi was great - the shrimp was cooked to perfection and the veggies on top were fresh. The veggie tacos were delish... yum!! Korean and Mexican fusion really works very well. I would love to come back here to taste the veggie bowl."
"Dude told me that the spicy tacos weren't that spicy yet I've been spending half of my shift today with hot booty. That's either a good or a bad thing depending on your perspective. On one hand, I get a bunch of bathroom breaks. On the other, my bottom burns with the intensity of Kevin Garnett on cocaine."
"Holy wow. Kimchi fries... Could have skipped the tacos entirely as these are more than a meal for me. Thought they sounded strange, but I'm the curious sort and was NOT disappointed! Plenty of kimchi and cheese, sour cream, green onions, and PORK BELLY BITS. I literally could not stop, got them to go and kept trying to put them in my fridge, and kept going back in for one more until I gave up, gave in, and finished them off. Take a friend or friends and share unless you are okay with waking up a little bigger tomorrow.Tacos were great too, tried the kalbi and sesame shrimp. Both were tasty, but the shrimp, with its light batter, tasty toothsome cabbage, and amazing, slightly spicy sauce, was the standout.This review is making me hungry, which leads me to a short consumer alert: this place's food is addictive!The only thing that doesn't do it for me @ this place is the ambience: there isn't any, and they keep it a little cold too, so take a sweater and an entourage or take it home to gorge yourself in private."
Any Chicagoan at one point in time had to have tried this place before. Well worth the visit their fries and tacos are top notch.
"The food here has an interesting spin. A fusion of Korean and Latin. I like the fact you order first and then they direct your siting. It's quick, fast and easy. The food comes running out by a server and you sit and wait to be served. It's a little tight of a space but the set up makes it work. The food is good and not very expensive."
Absolutely love this place! My favorite meal is the shrimp tacos and the kimchi fries with aioli. Highly recommend
"Kalbi Poutine. That is all.Nah, I'm just kidding. There's definitely more to say. But the Kalbi poutine is amazing. More on that later...I've been coming here for a while now (gotta support my brothers and sisters!), but a review has escaped me. I can say that this place delivers the good each and every time. I love the kalbi and shrimp tacos best. And with the addition of Kalbi poutine, this place has entered legendary status. Korean slow-braised short rib (Kalbi Jim), beef demi gravy, blended cheeses, seasoned cream, scallions and house pickled onions. Simply amazing.You know what, I just made myself hungry. I'm going to get some right now."
3 close to 4 stars.I ordered the kalbi taco.  The slaw/salad had good flavor but the kalbi was a little tough and lukewarm.I could probably eat 4-5 of these if it were cooked right.
"If you're currently reading this review, then I strongly recommend to stop what you're doing and walk, no run, to Del Seoul. Get their chicken wings, shrimp tacos, and kimchi fries and feast until you can feast no more."
"I was craving some rice and thought I would try the bibimbap for the first time ever! it was really good but it was really hard for me to mix all the toppings together. some of the stuff made it hard for me to chew too (I have braces, lol), but I managed! I really wanted to try the tacos but because I was taking it to-go, they told me it would get soggy. I'll definitely be coming back again though to try some tacos and maybe get the bibimbap again for sure!!"
"Best Korean taco joint in Chicago. I always get 4 chili shrimp tacos (their best taco), 1 kalbi taco, and poutine fries (really fucking good)."
Great fresh inexpensive food! KImchi is to die for! I wish I could buy it in larger jars!
"Del-Seoul was my first exposure to Korean fusion and is still my favorite place for Korean tacos. I've been to many different fusion restaurants, but this place is always gonna be my number one! Their menu has expanded by added a variety of tacos, but I would definitely recommend getting the shrimp taco! The sauce they add to food is so mouthwatering that it will make you want to order another one. Another item I LOVE from their menu is their kimchi fries. You seriously can't go wrong with that... Make sure you order fries with your tacos. I promise you that you won't regret it! :)"
"I've been to Del Seoul several times. As a fast casual Mexican/Korean place, this will not fail to disappoint. The shrimp tacos are injected with incredible flavor, and the serving of fish in the fish taco will satisfy your fishy cravings. Also, a very unsung shout-out to the K-Town Chicken wings, they fairly bready, but once again are very well cooked and flavored (warning they are very hot when you get them). Interior is casual, relaxed. Can get your fix for 10-15 bucks. Be careful that there is a quite a spectrum of flavor in this menu - so if you go from most flavorful to least flavorful -- the ending my be a bit bland."
"The tofu tacos I had were delicious, and I love that they sell Milkis! Unfortunately they have a severe lack of vegetarian options... There were only two items on the menu I could order!"
"The pros- Their tacos are tasty and different. It is worth a try! The cons- When this place first opened, everyone was telling me I had to try it. After my first visit, I agreed! The second time I visited, I noticed the prices went up and the taco shell was smaller. Now, I think the tacos are overpriced. I know a few taco places that are cheaper, better, and much closer to my house. Instead of making the long drive up here to pay more for my tacos, I much rather stay closer to home."
"The only thing I can add to all of the other positive reviews is my vote for five stars.I've been here a dozen times or more, with *never* a miss on the quality of the product.  I always go for kalbi and pork tacos with a generous squirt of sriracha.  Rinse and repeat.I'll try the bulgogi one of these days, but the tacos never get old.  Price/value may feel like a mild splurge, but you won't regret it."
"Since we couldn't decide whether to eat mexican or asian food, Del Seoul was perfect! Del Seoul is an order at register, and then it gets delivered when seated. kind of a fusion between sit-down and a fast-food place. Which I quite like :]Food we chose:1. Tacos sesame chili shrimp (~$3): Truly delicious -  the savory, creamy sweet sauce and crunchiness of the shrimp but $3 for one taco is very expensive. :/2. Tacos kalbi (~$3): definitely preferred Shrimp Taco. This just tasted like, Meh - Kalbi. Not worth $3 in my opinion. 3. Bibimbap ($10): I've never had Bibimbap before and it's a delightful combination of rice, egg, carrots, mushrooms, beef, and other ingredients in a stone pot that made the rice crunchy. I really liked this combination, very 4. KimChi fries ($7): Most disappointing dish. I guess since so many people raved about it being amazing. there was just too much kimchi on the fries but the fries tastes better without the toppings. It made it all soggy and unappetizing. 5. Wings ($10) for 8 pieces: Piping hot and seasoned well with sweet bbq sauce. Granted, this is not their specialty - Wings were soft not and I still prefer Crisp because of the crisp skin before sauce. But Del Seoul wings still tasted good nonetheless. Overall, the price was quite hefty for the food we got. But overall my favorites were the Taco Shrimp, Bibimbap and the Wings. There are more specialized places for each of the dishes but Del Seoul presents an interesting fusion of flavors and delivery. I'm not sure if I would return but Del Seoul is definitely worth a try!"
"I only went to Del seoul once but I really liked it. My first time there I got the kimchi fries. I really like the kimchi fries and I would go there again and get the kimchi fries again. I do believe that the kimchi fries a little over priced, for the small amount of kimchi they give.What I noticed when I went in the restaurant was that I saw the employees were wearing this nice shirt. The cashier told me that you can also buy the shirt for around $10 from what I remember but I thought it was very cute and it stood out to me."
"AWESOME shrimp tacos- one of the best I have had. I would not recommend the tofu tacos though, they look well seasoned but are rather bland. I wish they had more space to maneuver. Definitely not kid or group friendly. This is more of a fast food type of place."
One of my favorite places to eat in chicago!! They have the most delicious shrimp tacos and their chicken wings are great. They also offer a few korean juices/soda. The prices here are reasonable and service is great. Must try this place if you love asian fusion dishes.
"Not sure what's left to say that hasn't been said already. This place is simply fantastic.- excellent food! Best shrimp tacos I've ever had. I usually get 2 shrimp tacos and a miso soup, but have also shared the 'poutine' with friends, which is delicious. Even their regular fries are good -- they are spiced and come with a tasty dipping sauce. I had the kalbi beef taco on my first visit, which was good, but the shrimp tacos are so damn good, I'd rather just get that. I've never ordered any of the larger menu items, but my friends love the bibimop.- quick & friendly service- super casual - you order at the counter and get a number at your table- cheap prices!Del Seoul, keep up the great work."
"An excellent ""fast food"" Korean restaurant!  I'm half Korean and have been spoiled with homemade Korean food from my grandmother my entire life.  Sometimes I get a Korean food craving and this place hits the spot! I enjoyed the bibimbop and the kimchi fries on my last visit.  The kimchi fries are a weirdly delicious entree that you will never find in an authentic Korean restaurant, but a great item on the menu!  The service was quick and friendly and worth the sprint in the ran.  I will be back to try the famous tacos as well!"
"These Korean tacos are scrumptious. I love the shrimp and beef ones in particular. They are topped with an amazing slaw and a spicy sauce that pulls it all together. Don't miss the fries; tossed in a spice mix that enhances the flavor and makes it unique. They are served with a great dipping sauce which I prefer to ketchup!This is a ""fast"" food restaurant. You order at the counter and they bring it to you when it's ready. Really casual, fun atmosphere."
"I have been wanting to go here every time I came to Chicago, but never was able to... Since our friend lived a block away, I tried this place twice in one week! I am a huge sauce fan... and their sauces were on par! Very good shrimp tacos! Kalbi taco was ok... too sweet and salty for me.Dumplings were meh - too much dough.. a good dumpling as a little bit of pork juice inside and very thin skin, which this dumpling lacked. Overall, I would go here only for the shrimp tacos!"
"Tried following;Fish taco: ok..I was hoping for the fish taco that I used to have in Soho, NYC...but guess it is hard to find it in Chicago yet.Shrimp taco: ok, it is like the shrimp rock that you can have from Japanese place but in tacoKalbi taco: This was pretty good. I strongly recommend this one! rocked it.Service: so so...there was Asian female server seems like have an attitude..but whatever"
"Go for the tacos and fries! Their shrimp taco is hands down the best I've ever had.The tofu soup was meh.  They added Kalbi poutine which I automatically assumed would have been the best decision of my life. I mean Kalbi, cheese, and gravy, duuuuuh! Only every woman's dream! But in reality, I think the kimchi fries were much better."
"I think this place is fab-u-lous. It's like street food, indoors, and that's tops in my book. It's a casual fast food joint - meaning you order at the counter, they give you a number, then bring you the yummy when its ready. I told the woman at the counter this was my first time there and she told me what was most popular, what she liked the best and after I asked about a couple things she mentioned some were more two person oriented. I always appreciate someone who is willing to offer advice on their menu. Good customer service goes a long way in my book. I ordered the 3 most popular tacos and I still can't decide which one is my favorite. I guess this means I will just have to go back and try them again! I watched some of the other items coming out of the kitchen and they looked equally delicious. I love Bahn mi's and can't wait to try their twist on it. And I want to try the Bibimbop, mostly because I think it's a fun word to say! Also, kimchi and pork belly fries? Shut the front door! Back to the tacos, I ordered the following: -Sambal fish tempura haddock with pickled red onions, napa slaw, spicy sambal sauce-Sesame-chili shrimp with hand-battered panko shrimp, cilantro-onion relish, sesame-chili aioli, secret slaw, toasted sesames-Kalbi grilled beef short rib with cilantro-onion relish, secret slaw, toasted sesames. Wow, all so so so good. Great combination of flavors. What was hot, was hot and what was suppose to be crunchy was crunchy and what was suppose to be spicy was spicy. Well done DS!This place is going to the top of my Chicago favorites list. STAT."
"It's in a great location, has agreeable prices, and a good amount of space for those who want to dine in.The food was Awesome with a capital a. I got the shrimp tacos and my girlfriend got the hot stone bibimpot. Scroll through ten reviews and you'll get the gist for the shrimp tacos, they are spectacularly delightful. I really really liked the bibimpot too, so very well done with the cuisine. The only knock was the girl who served us. Abrupt and apathetic. She bothered us when she took our order, so we looked back when we talked about it while eating. Her overtly loathing attitude really hindered what could and should have been a great first visit."
I had the khimchi fries n shrimp tacos . I did not like the shrimp tacos but the khimchi friess were really good
"Great spot for takeout or a quick bite. Delicious chicken and pork tacos (pork is my favorite)! Though it's not my thing, fiancé loves the kimchi here. I tried the kimchi covered fries and they were pretty good as well. Can't believe I went so long in the neighborhood before I tried this place! Definitely worth a visit!"
"For those that know me, know that I get cravings more often then a pregnant woman lol! So as you can imagine,  I was craving a korean bbq sandwich and i stumbled upon this place. ..I read their Spicy bbq pork banh mi was delish so I decided to get this and the Kimchi fries. I placed my order to go so sadly by the time I got home my fries didn't taste as good as I can imagine they would had I eaten them there. My sandwich however was DELISH! MMMM...just writing this review my mouth is watering lol.Now although the food is pretty good, I've been here twice so far and both times the staff have been unfriendly!! I'm HUUUGE on customer service and I get really turned off by a place with bad customer service.I may give this place another chance...third times a charm right?? But mark my words that if time #3 is just as unfriendly,  I will not be going back!"
"I'll make this quick (NY State of Mind here)! I got the Spicy Pork Bahn Mi sandwich and the Kalbi Taco.Spicy Pork Bahn Mi ($7) - EMPHASIS ON THE SPICY! Wow, did NOT expect that much spice. It was unexpected but pleasantly welcomed!  Good amount of meat (Look at my picture).Kalbi Taco ($3) - Yes, leave it to our Mexican brothers to do their job. We Koreans have no right touching and playing with it. And onto the next one...Great sandwich, bad taco. Pricey pricey though!"
"The food here was what I expected it to be when I walked in. The flavor combinations were good, but in the end my food was over salted. I decided to go with the shrimp tacos as their menu screen said this was their favorite dish. The shrimp were fried really well and had just enough batter on them. However each piece was over sauced. The spiced lettuce condiment for these tacos was in excess and I could have done with half the amount. Before going there was one dish I was really looking forward to eating, the kimchi fries. Picking my way around the dish I expected there to be a lot more kimchi, at least more than the tiny amount the was on top. The service was good and there was ample seating. People really seem to love this place as even at three in the afternoon there was still a respectable line. I think it deserves a second chance, but right now I can only say it was average."
"I came here on a whim and I am SO glad I did. The shrimp tacos were unreal. My friends got other tacos and were equally impressed. Looking around, it seemed that other diners all had their own preferences and seemed to be as content with theirs as I was with mine. That being said, it seems like you can't go wrong here. I came back again and was just as impressed as I was the first time. Consistently delicious.Don't forget the miso soup!"
"This restaurant is my back up plan for Toro Sushi a few doors down. When the wait is too long over there, we end up eating at this place. The food is pretty tasty. I usually get the fish taco, kimchi fries and beef bulgogi bento. We also tried other items, but don't remember them as well, probably not as good as these three ;)"
"Such great food.I have to come back and try the wings.I did try the shrimp taco, the kalbi taco, the kalbi poutine, and the kimchi fries.All were amazing. Deserving of the 5 yelp stars.The tacos are overflowing with ingredients and can easily be split onto two tortillas.The fries are piled high and heavily topped with delicious things and the poutine can be a meal in itself.Service was very friendly and fast."
"My first Del Seoul experience back in 2010/11? was not a very good experience. They were a small little restaurant with limited seating. When I go out to eat with family, we order a lot (err..too much) food to share, so we would like to sit together. A man that worked there at the time wouldn't let our party of 5 put two tables together (but we did anyways) and gave us the dirtiest look. But that was then, and this is now. I've forgiven that mystery man by now hahaha! Anyways.. I love Del Seoul!!!  The food is just amazing!!! Shrimp and kalbi tacos are a must. Poutine is great as well. Mouth is watering and stomach is growling as I type.."
"I wasn't completely hungry when I came in but the array of choices made me wish I was.  Parking on Clark around Wrightwood is pretty tough since you always seem to see an empty space on the other side of the street and by the time you u-turn, it's just taken.  We were able to get a space nearby and I paid for 1:15.  We left in 30 minutes because it came out pretty fast and we just wolfed the great food down.My friend had the shrimp taco and kimchi fries while I went with the kalbi, spicy pork, and spicy chicken tacos.  The tacos came out quickly and were well dressed with lettuce and sauce on toasted corn tortillas.  I liked the spicy pork best followed by kalbi then spicy chicken.  Even though I like sriracha sauce, it wasn't needed for these full flavored tacos with plenty of meat.  The kimchi fries came out shortly thereafter and were definitely a hit!  I was weary about the mix of bar food with Korean food, but the combination worked.  The top part was like melted cheese fries with a light crema and some green onions.  But underneath was the kimchi and pork belly, so you definitely need to use a fork to get all the good stuff.  Overall, I'd definitely return for some tacos and to try the dumplings and kalbi poutine."
"This place is amazing, would highly recommend! Great food, quick service. I've tried the tacos and they were incredible, certainly life changing! The poutine fries, soo good. I will definitely be visiting again."
"Food:-Sesame-chili shrimp and kalbi tacos, rare instance of fusion done right-Kimchi fries, wasn't memorableService:-Surprisingly quick and half self-service-Forgot one of our orders and didn't offer anything to make up for it, but the prices were reasonable enough so I let my anger goI haven't had good korean/fusion food in so long those tacos almost made me cry. LEGIT."
"The talk of this place does it wonders, I came here because it seems like everyone of my friends loved the place after eating here, so I HAD to stop by when I came back to Chicago to visit my family.  Great idea to mix Korean and Mexican! Loved the tacos and also homemade kimchi."
Excellent food every time.  I love everything on their menu
"I think I was just excited to simply find a Korean BBQ.  What's even more exciting is that there is an empanada shop next door.  Field Trip!  Well, just found this place on Friday and ate there for Lunch.  Then when dinner came around, I opted for a 2nd helping.  The shrimp tacos were probably my favorite choice of the day, but you simply can't ignore the other choices on this menu.  Also had the fish and the chicken tacos as well.  For dinner with home girl we tried the Kalbi Bento Box and Bibimbop & dumplings  I have no idea how to pronounce anything I ordered but it was all worth ordering again and I probably will.  Now I had some stomach issues, but I also drank 3 bottles of wine the night before, so I had some trouble narrowing down the cause of the after dinner dumplings.  Honestly, even if it was the food, I still wouldn't hesitate to order again."
"Kim chi- deliciousFish tacos - amazingShrimp taco - good (but fish trumped, although my friends prefer the shrimp)Veggie Bibimbap - ..wouldn't get again. Barely any egg and it was overcooked so you couldn't mix it around.Fries - sauce that comes with it is fabulousFriends got the kalbee taco, chicken taco, and dumplings and loved them.Very disappointed by the bibimbop but the fish tacos and other items are so good, and the prices are so affordable, that I have to give it 5 stars."
"Del Seoul korean tacos are good, however I've had better korean tacos elsewhere. One thing i will say is.. they have my favorite fries of all time here, the Galbi Poutin Fries. Wow I had to eat two of these because they were so good. Will definitely come back again."
"We (my boyfriend and I) love this place. It's close to our apartment, fast and delicious. We have have frequented this place since it opened. We don't cook much. the shrimp tacos are our favorite. I can fit two to three in at a time. Sadly, as word has gotten around the space has expanded and become busier and busier. I'm happy for them but their service has been compromised but I hope their food does not suffer. Their staff seems over worked and unhappy to answer the phone or assist with the line of hungry patrons. Because the tacos are good I've gone back, but if service continues to deteriorate it will cost a customer."
"I looove the flavors here. The kalbi beef tacos and poutine (I'd be OK ordering the poutine fries alone) are delicioso. Also, I recently discovered the wings, which are sticky and increible. Another go-to is the shrimp taco. For around $40, my bf and I get some of all of these things and we have scrumptious leftovers for later. We live nearby. So, Del Seoul is definitely a staple for us."
"Great place to grab a quick bite.  Laid back with friendly service and great food!  We had the following:- Sesame-Chili Shrimp Taco: hand-battered panko shrimp, cilantro-onion relish, sesame-chili aioli, secret slaw and toasted sesames; this taco was my favorite, and their best seller, it was awesome.- Kalbi (Grilled Beef Short Rib) Taco: grilled beef short rib, cilantro-onion relish, secret slaw, and toasted sesames; also another great taco, delicious!- Kimchi fries: french fries topped with sautéed Kimchi, onions and pork belly, scallions, melted cheddar and jack, and sour cream; these were okay, not that memorable - Seoul Style Street Dumplings: steamed homemade pork dumplings with sake-soy dipping sauce; these were also okay, not that memorableThis place have delicious tacos, would come here just for that!"
Kimchi fries!!!! I love the chili shrimp taco! Must try! Great staff and good food for the right price.
"I went just before the dinner rush. Waiting on my friends to arrive was the hardest part. If you ever find yourself in that situation order a taco there while you wait. Totally reasonable price and taco is stuffed to the max.  There's a decent amount of tables, mostly for 2 but your can always scooch them together. Everything on the menu sounds delish. I got the bulgogi box dish and it was yummy. Grilled flat iron steak and rice. Plate presentation was nice. It came with a salad that did not look as appetizing so I passed it over to my friend. You bus your own table, order food at the counter then they deliver to your table. Simple yet satisfying."
"I was anticipating the kimchi fries but was very disappointed. It was soooo salty that I thought I was going to grow hair on my breasts! I don't know if we got a bad batch, but please cut down on the sodium!"
"FOOD = ABSOLUTELY AM AZING!!!! SERVICE = COULD BE BETTER, ATMOSPHERE: CAFETARIA-LIKEI came here with a friend and hearing all the buzz about this place, the food was uberly good but the service we got was a bit snotty from the girl who worked in the front. Maybe because food tastes good she didn't care much on how to treat the customers because people would still come back. Hmm i don't know being that this was my first time here and an out of towner, I was displeased with her service. I asked what she recommended and she didn't even give me a response. So whatever here's the stuff on what I thought was good. Being a fan of tacos in general, I just had to order the three that sounded good - bulgogi, kalbi, and shrimp. They tasted amazing and the flavors were all there. Meat was tender and the sauces were very well marinated. Splitting the kimchi fries with my friend, this was also another popular tasty item on their menu. The spices were there but wasn't sure about the fries themselves. I like my fries crispy and they came out pretty soft to me. Anyhow, they also have bibimbop and street style dumplings which I have to come back to try. Located by Lincoln Park, this is an area to stop by during the week to grab a quick bite to eat for lunch and grabbing Molly cupcakes after for dessert."
My friend Sany N. recommended this place to me because 1) I was hungry and 2) we were going to Molly's cupcakes.  I really wanted to go in to satisfy my korean food craving (it used to be easily accessible in Los Angeles!!).  They have a great variety of korean tacos... I would say way more than what the Kogi Truck had to offer.  I went in for the bimbimbap hot stone bowl and it was really good!!  I loved that my rice was super crispy at the end of the meal.  You can't really go wrong with bimbimbap :).  Next time... I'm going back for those tacos!!
"The reason I gave it 4 stars is the food is amazing! Excellent quality. They have a wide variety of menu items to choose from. However, if it came to the staff, I would give it 2 stars. Luckily in recent months, It seems they hired a few new people who are very nice and helpful. However, there is one person in particular that is just awful when it comes to personality. She is the blonde with the bright red lipstick. Every time I am in there, (which is a good amount) she is ALWAYS rude, bitchy and acts like she is going out of her way to simply to her job, When she brings your food to your table, she almost slams the basket down. And God forbid you have to ask for a side of something, she acts as if you asked her to give her one of her kidneys! The food is great, but I really don't know how someone with that much rudeness to customers keeps a job there!!"
Absolutely delicious. Their tofu tacos are incredible.
"Love these tacos!! Korean and Mexican fusion dishes are the best! My favorite are the fish tacos. The poutine seems a bit overpriced for what you get though, so I would stick to the tacos."
"The first time I ate here it was really good, the second time was just OK. I think dinner time may have better side dishes than lunch."
"Sambal Fish Taco $3.95,  Sesame Chili Shrimp $2.99 and Kalbi Taco $2.95.Kimchee Fries and Mandoo (10-15 minutes to make).Great place to get some good fusion Korean foods."
"The food is interesting and good, but honestly, both my tacos and my kimchi fries were not fully up to temperature, which surprised me because the service is fast. The flavor was still decent, but the toppings on the Kimchi fries were kind of plastic-like and not very fresh. That was disappointing. Still good, but I hope they pay attention to slip ups like that."
"WOW. If you like new flavors and awesome food then try this place. It says on the menu that the shrimp taco is their best one and they weren't kidding.GET THE SHRIMP TACOS. I made the mistake of only ordering one and I was so sad when it was gone...they're crispy and super delicious. Almost like honey walnut shrimp but even better.  We also had the kalbi beef and spicy chicken tacos but the shrimp blew those out of the water. We also tried the kimchi fries, they were pretty decent. The kimchi was very very good but if I were to get them again I'd probably do no cheese & no sour cream.I'm definitely going back!"
"After reading some many glowing reviews of DS, my cousin and I stopped by for lunch. We wanted to make sure we didn't have to wait in a line very long, so we arrived shortly after 11:30. We split a taco (can't remember which one), which probably tells you how memorable it was to me...or it couldn't be an overload for my taste buds, from all the other places we had been to. We also order the pork banh mi, and of course kimchi fries. The fries were pretty good, but honestly for the price they charge and amount of people they get, I would've expected a lot more than what they served. Also the dish could've used more pork and kimchi. That was the first time I had an banh mi, so I really don't have anything to compare it to, but thought the whole sandwich was a bit dry, and once again, not enough filling. Overall, I would say the meal was good and wouldn't mind trying other dishes at DS, the next time I go out that way."
"The shrimp and chicken tacos are my favorite. Inexpensive, unique flavors, and quick service. This is good spot when you want a delicious meal or snack without much wait or fanciness."
"I lived a block away from Del Seoul for a couple years before trying it out. Then, within a month, 3 different friends wanted to go there. The tacos are SO good. I usually go for the shrimp or fish, but always get at least 3 different kinds. The fries are also a must have."
"The Korean tacos were really good - I asked for a little extra sauce as they were a bit on the drier side but that could've just been my own preference. However, it was the Kalbi Poutine (fries covered in short ribs, kim chi, cheese, sour cream, etc.) that knocked our socks off! We were in Chicago for 5 days and came back just for the Kalbi Poutine!!! Try it! You won't be disappointed!"
"I had the Korean chicken wings,  they are perfect blend of hot and sweet.  They go really good with the kimchi, ( spicy cabbage).  Also try the shrimp tacos,  one of the best I've had in Chicago.  Over all a great experience and will definitely be coming back to try other stuff on the menu."
"Their fish tacos are delicious masterpieces!  I eat here all of the time, can't get enough."
"I had the shorty rib and spicy pork taco.  I'm Korean, and would have liked to write a rave review for them but taste of meats was only so-so. I think they could have used a different type and seasoning for vegetable to better complement the meats."
"Finally tried this place and was not disappointed, got the sambal fish, sesame-chili shrimp, kalbi (grilled beef short rib) and spicy bbq pork tacos to go. All the tacos came in big portions for roughly 3$ a piece. Did not get to try the poutine this time but it looked good. All the tacos were delicious, and had great sauces in the slaw on top, as well as on the actual tacos. My only criticism was that the cashier took so long to take my order, and I had to wait a while for my food, but it was so good I didn't mind. Will definitely be coming back to try different menu items."
"I love Del Seoul's food! The fish taco, shrimp taco, and hot stone bibimbap are the best!! I live in the neighborhood so I come pretty often. I'd give them 5 stars except for one thing... The decor needs some major maintenance. The chairs are stained, the table edges are chipped off, the window seats are completely sunken in and torn. It just makes it seem like they don't care about the place. Give yourself a facelift Del Seoul! Knock down that awkward wall! Touch up the paint. Your customers will appreciate a nice, clean environment while we stuff our faces."
Yasss!!!!!!! Best fish and shrimp tacos ever!!!!!!!! That is all.
I've been dreaming of their sesame-chili shrimp tacos since I tried them...what took me so long to come here?!? The spicy BBQ pork banh mi was awesome too! This isn't a place I would come to with friends to hang out for a bite; it's more of a pick up and go destination in my opinion. Typically has a long but it goes quickly. Bonus points for having pineapple crush...ahhh!
"As a native Texan, I'm partial towards anything Mexican/Mexi - Mexican Martinis, Tex-Mex, Mexican chocolate, Mexican Coke, and I even had a Mexi boyz phase. So as soon as I heard there was a Korean-Mexican fusion restaurant in Chicago, I broke out into song and dance to Juanes (cue: A dios le pido). I have fond memories of Chilantro in Austin, so my expectations were definitely high. Del Seoul was definitely up to the test.We practically ordered everything on the menu - tacos, kimchi fries, banh mi, and dumplings. Everything was delicious. I had the Sesame-Chili Shrimp taco as well as the Kalbi taco. The shrimp taco was BURSTING with flavor. All of the toppings/dressings were delicious and went so well together. The beef short rib on the Kalbi taco was so juicy and tender. I was impressed by both. The kimchi fries were another favorite. They were totally different/amazingly better compared to any other kimchi fries I've had previously. Instead of just having a tad bit of kimchi and special sauce/atomic sauce/chilantro sauce/etc, they were loaded with sour cream, melted cheese, kimchi, a few garnishes, and other goodies. Del Seoul basically took the best parts of a baked potato and some Korean influences to make some BOMB ASS FRIES. Get them, you won't be disappointed. The banh mi and dumplings were also good, but pretty standard. Not saying they were bad, just nothing particularly special. The atmosphere is super casual and the employees are nice. Del Seoul is just a damn good place with really good food that that warms da soul. Even moreso than chicken soup.Disclamer: I haven't tried La Tacorea as of yet, so I can't offer a comparison between the two. However, the friend I was with had tried both and said they are pretty comparable."
Korean tacos?!?!?! who knew? Tasty though!
I absolutely love this place.  Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because they often screw up the orders but the food is truly delicious.
"How can I not give this place 5 stars?  I was a bit skeptical at first since I normally don't like fusion anything but man, Del Seoul manages to keep dishes traditional with a flare.  I particularly LOVE the kimchee fries and the hot stone bowl of bibimbap. Fast, easy, and quite affordable for Lincoln Park."
"AMAZING! Totally a fan! Finally some delicious Korean BBQ in ChiTown!Moving from Southern California, it was a difficult transition for us in finding authentic Korean BBQ. So far, this seems like its going to be as good as it gets.(For those of you familiar with SoCal Korean BBQ and food trucks - this is a better side of the Kogi Truck. The Korean BBQ tacos without too much of the forced fusion.)The tacos are amazing. Not large. They are small like authentic street tacos. So, if you're hungry and of about average size, you could probably down at least 4 of them. You really can't go wrong with any of the offerings. The kimchi fries (with pork belly) were just ok. I am not a big fan of cooked kimchi. I think it would probably be a LOT better if it was just regular uncooked kimchi and fried pork belly.THE LINE is out the door but they are pretty quick and have the seating and numbering system down to a T. Definitely worth the wait! We'll be regulars for sure!"
"Been wanting to hit this place up for a long time...being an out of towner, I finally had several days in Chi town and made it here. The decor is nice, the place is super clean, but what stands out, that I will never forget, is the FLAVOR of the food. The shrimp tacos were the best tacos I've probably ever had of any style, any ethnicity, anywhere! The slaw on the taco is incredible, the shrimps were huge and glazed in some sort of awesome chili sauce. It was refreshing with a ton of cilantro goodness. Just delicious...can't say enough. I went for the Bee-bim-bop next and although I've had it here in St. Louis before, this seemed more authentic and the veggies were extra fresh. Tasty kimchi, not too mild, not too spicy...just right. On the way back to St. Louis, I could not stop thinking about that food and was kicking myself for not getting some to go. Can't wait to stop back by up here in August when I come back."
"I've tried a number of different dishes here and haven't been thrilled by most of them. Not bad, but not great either. That being said, the chicken wings here might be the best chicken wings I've ever eaten anywhere. The sauce is incredible and the meat comes right off the bone. The bento boxes are also pretty good. I usually order takeout but when I go to sit down the service is fast."
"Lived in the area and somehow missed this gem! Fortunately, my wonderful BF introduced me to amazing tacos with a Korean twist. We shared 4 tacos (sooooo much better than Big Star!), gamja fries (The Peasantrys truffle fries are much better than) & the bimbibop (?) - filling but oh so good!"
The best part of this place is the stone bowls- they truly are amazing. I'm not a big fan of the tacos and the place loses stars for the long wait and not so upbeat service.
"It's hard to find a place that has consistently good take out.  My boyfriend and I always order the same thing -- spicy bbq pork and sambai fish tacos and we split the spicy bbq pork bahn mi sandwich and Gamja fries. I would definitely recommend the bahn mi sandwich, the ingredients are always fresh and the jalapenos give it a nice kick.Tacos aren't nearly as good as the ones from Taco Joint but it's nice to change it up every once and a while."
"Kalbi Tacos. Good.Bibimbop. Good.Kimchi fries. Good.Sesame chili shrimp tacos.  Yum.Everything was good.  Not amazing, but good.  It was a little busy but the prices are reasonable.  I'd like to give it 3.5 stars."
"I've already waxed poetic about the bulgogi, but this time I decided to change it up a bit and try these Korean tacos everyone's been talking about. Now I get it. The shrimp tacos are quite possibly one of the best things you'll ever put in your mouth (please don't make that one into a pun).I wasn't hungry when I walked in. I certainly wasn't hungry after a trio of taco's. I still shamelessly got up and ordered 2 more."
"Delicious food.  I usually get their Kimchi Fries, but their tacos are really good too.It's an interesting take on Korean food.Service has been hit or miss, but never terrible or amazing."
"Korean tacos you ask? Yes that's the concept. That was the hype in California for awhile and I'm glad Chicago has it! I got every kind of taco they had except the fish taco. My favorite was the Kalbi taco. The chicken was the next best, then the shrimp. They give you a fair amount of meat in each taco and splash on their sauce and some veggies. They have a condiments table in the back corner, so I added Sriracha to mine (of course...). I also got the Kalbi kimchi fries. The were good, but honestly, the kalbi is unnecessary. They give you kalbi in such sparse amounts that it's not even worth it. You're better off buying a Kalbi taco. Other than that, it's excellent. For what it's worth, my Korean friend (hi Soomin!) was hesitant to come, but decided to try it anyway. She said she liked it. :)Why 4 and not 5 stars? Well it wasn't the best tasting Korean taco I've had. Plus, somehow I managed to spend ~$30 here and I didn't even leave that full. Satisfied, but not really full. I can eat all you can eat Korean BBQ in California for $20 and leave stuffed!TIP: They sell Hi-Chew candy here! Just for those who like Hi-Chew :) They're advertised for $1.25 for a stick. I think they charged me $1.30, though... (shifty eyes...)((Also, since I'm giving shout-outs, I gotta thank my buddy Yanmen for suggesting this place. Join the Yelp family now!))"
3.5stars. I like their kimchi fries. I had their kimchi fried rice and tasted okay... Nothing special.
"It's like Big Star Korean style. Kalbi & Spicy BBQ pork tacos are beyond flavorful & satisfying. Kimchi fries that everyone raves about was ok, might want to skip it. The dumplings were really good too & steamed fir a healthier choice.  Next to try is the chicken wings!!"
I LOVE DEL SEOUL! I frequent this joint way too much. I'm addicted to their Kalbi Beef Tacos and Pork Dumplings!! I've had other dishes too though and everything has been delicious. There is almost always a line when I go so I don't think they'll be going out of business any time soon. I love you Del Seoul!
As good as it gets sums this place up.  I've never had something on the menu I didn't love.  Prices are spot on and everything is fresh and delicious- Korean fusion at it's best.The bulgogi sandwich and gamja fries are a must.
"High quality all around, got the fish shrimp and chicken tacos, also dumplings and kimchi fries, all were really good, i recommend all 3 of them"
"About a 2-2.5: I remember Del Seoul being much more awesome-er with having more bigger-sized flavorful portions compared to the recent trip - I had the Kalbi Taco (that contained grilled beef short ribs, sesame-chili aioli, and the eatery's secret slaw - no cilantro relish for me) - it was actually nice and flavorful, and you can taste the galbi bits (more on the chewy side, rather than being tender) - I wished they would pure more of the meat than the lettuce slaw; they also forgot to give me an extra corn tortilla! :(  I also had a side of the Kimchi Fries, and the pork belly wasn't really cooked well; the kimchi bits were well-fermented and had good taste, but the portion definitely decreased by half!  My friend had the Spicy BBQ Chicken, and the chicken bits actually had decent flavor - I was surprised!  She also ordered the Kalbi Poutine, which were french fries topped with brasied short rib, beef demi gravy, cheese, seasoned crema, scallions, and house pickled red onions.  The galbi was more like a jjim, and it had a lot of good flavor.  I'm not sure if I liked the pickled red onions, as this eatery really likes to pack in a lot of the veggies as their 'garnish,' so I probably would ask them to hold that.  I'm not sure if the place is doing a renovation or not, but it was a little dark and dingy in there.  A lot of people seemed to be ordering their sandwiches and their Dol Sot bibimbops.+galbi+well-fermented kimchi"
"My first time trying and it was a hit! We're were in a real hurry so didn't have time to sit and glad service is quick and food was great! We ordered the Kalbi, spicy BBQ park and spice BBQ chicken tacos to share and Seoul style street dumplings with soy-sake sauce that was perfectly steamed and hot. The seasonings on the tacos were right on and it was honestly difficult to tell between the pork and chicken tacos because they had the same spices and almost the same texture. I would definitely come back!"
"Lemme tell you something. You NEED Korean tacos in your life. You may not realize it today, but the first time you take a bite of the deliciousness that awaits you at Del Seoul, you'll be hooked.You must have three kimchi French fries. They look crazy, but they taste delicious. My only complaint is that you can't byob, and they don't serve alcohol. Otherwise, I'm into this place."
"I love tacos. I love Korean food. I love a good fusion.  Del Seoul was good.  I had a kalbi beef taco and fish taco.  Shared the Kalbi poutine.  Everything was very flavorful.  I wish there was a little more kimchi to the tacos though; not enough heat.  The fish taco was fried, and I knew that going in... but there was a lot of batter around the piece of fish.  The kalbi poutine also had a lot of sour cream, I wish it had more actual kalbi.  Whenever you got a bite of pickled onion, french fry, and beef it was really good!  Just not enough meat to have a good amount of those perfect bites.  I liked the idea of kalbi poutine, i feel like the execution could've been a little bit better. I get the impression that there's a lot of ""fluff"" in the food, and not actual product.  For example, there was a lot of cabbage slaw in our tacos; wish there was more meat.  On the poutine, a lot of fries and sour cream sauce; wish there was more meat and pickled onions. It's a cool place to hang out though.  And the music they were playing was pretty cool!"
"Had the kalbi, the fish and the shrimp tacos... kalbi was a little dry but still good. Fish n shrimp tacos were delicious. Fish tacos were best by far, shrimp tacos had a bit too much of the honey crunch for me. Fries are amazing.. fresh and well seasoned and topped with choice of kalbi or kimchi. Street style dumplings were good.. thin wrapping with vermicelli, chives n pork. Props for originality.. there was a line when i came, but line moves pretty fast. Would definitely recommend."
"I want to love you Del Seoul, I really do. Ever since I had my first Korean taco from Roy Choi's Kogi, I've wanted to find a place  that can recreate that magic. Your flavors are on point and your secret slaw is awfully tasty, but some je ne sais quois was missing. Maybe it's eating these tacos at a table with all the standard accoutrements in tow rather than on a curb with the sun in your face and grease fingers galore. I don't know what can be done to your taco to make it more Kogi-esque, I just know they're good enough for me to come back again and again. P.s. your flour torillas are 10x better than your corn tortillas. What's up with that?"
"I've been twice now and they have no bad items. Its a great feeling that you can order anything and be wowed, especially in a casual atmosphere."
Really good food and experience. I would have never thought to mix Korean food with tacos. The kimchi fries are delicious!
"I've heard mixed reviews about Del Seoul - amazing, over-hyped, fell short, pricey but good - but I thought they put on a solid taco. I had the shrimp, fish, and kalbi tacos (listed in order of enjoyment haha). The shrimp taco had a rich and sweet batter, and shrimp pieces were sizable. It was topped with cabbage that had hints of korean bbq flavors. The fish taco was very reminiscent of a San Diego fish taco, including the sauce. It had one large fish filet in a fluffy batter.The kalbi tacos were least enjoyable because the meat quality cheaper, chewier, and fattier than what you would imagine for a ""kalbi"". The sauce and cabbage toppings were nearly identical to the shrimp taco. All in all, I really enjoyed the Korean taco concept, but I agree it is a little pricey for what you get."
"I LOVE Del Seoul!  They were a pioneer in bringing Mexican-influenced Korean to Chicago.  I have eaten there by myself and with my family probably 25+ times, and the restaurant operates at a consistently high standard.The following dishes are terrific: shrimp tacos, kalbi tacos, gamja fries, and dolsot bibimbap.And it is super cheap - you can eat like a king for $12 per person.BTW, I am a half Korean who grew up in Texas, so this is like the greatest possible combination of comfort foods for me!"
"Where do I even begin? I have lived down the street from Del Seoul for over a year, and it took me until this past summer to try it in all its glory. I had passed by it probably close to 100 times and never thought to try it; the idea of Korean BBQ was never my thing.I am so glad my friend convinced me to order the shrimp tacos one fateful day in August. The moment changed my life.The orange sauce they use. The sesame seeds. The way the shrimp is breaded and fried to perfection. The tortillas. It all blends together to create a sensation I don't know if I could live without. A friend who is contemplating moving to New York cited, ""I won't be able to get Del Seoul anymore."" as one of his reasons he might stay in Chicago. My roommate said Del Seoul is stopping her from becoming a vegetarian. I took my boss here last Friday and yesterday he told me, ""I really need to get Del Seoul again this week."" I'm not kidding; these are actual conversations I have had regarding this amazing restaurant.The service is always great. The tacos are always mouth-watering. I want one now. Or three. Or six. Damn it."
GOOD GOLLY! This place is amazing! When we briefly moved back to Houston this place was on of the ONLY places we really craved.Love the Kim Chi Fries and now their Kalbi Beef Poutine! So good.I prefer the Pork Tacos but my girlfriend prefers the Shrimp. Really I don't think you can go wrong with any of them. The Banh-Mi is also really tasty. As good as any I've had in Chicago.Order at least Two because these are the tiny tacos a-la-Big Star style.
"ohhh yes.  My brother and I blew through some serious $$$ on 10 tacos, a banh mi and kim chi fries in the span of 30 minutes. It was well worth it. i tried one of the sambal fish, the sesame chili shrimp, kalbi and bbq pork tacos. I'd say i loved all of them. as for the banh mi, the sesame chili shrimp sandwich was light on the cilantro for me but heavy with flavor and deliciousness. i'm pretty sure i had to waddle out of here afterwards.I also loved the asian snacks for sale, and made sure to grab a calpis drink for myself. this place is pretty quick, and the friendly staff makes for a enjoyable experience.pretty sure i'd come back to throw down with those tacos as long as there wasn't a crazy wait. luckily i came on a weekday half an hour before closing when it was frigid cold outside, so it was only partially full. one of the few times I'm thankful for the wicked winter weather here - separates those truly dedicated to the pursuit of something from those weaker souls ;)FYI: Del Seoul is NOT BYOB. Just in case you were wondering."
"Del Seoul has a lot of great options if you are looking to satisfy a fix for Korean food without leaving Lincoln Park. The tacos are solid and tasty, but for fusion food, there isn't a spark of originality here.  I prefer the tofu hot pot or dolsot bibimbop, which are both less fusion and much more like what you will get at an authentic Korean restaurant.  Also had the wings which are a newer addition to the menu.  The wings are crispy, juicy, nicely fried, but I don't really get the sauce-- I don't think I'd order this again.   The prices are a little higher than you would get at a standard Korean restaurant, but then again I don't believe there are any in Lincoln Park.  The atmosphere is young, trendy, fast food wannabe.  Likewise, the staff is young and cheerful.  If I lived closer, I would probably eat here quite often."
"Chicken wings are good.   I devoured it all, but I can imagine them to be great when cold.bimbibap was good.My friend highly recommends kimchi fries, which I have to come back and try some day.  Parking was difficult!!!   Service was fast but minimum."
"This place is among one of my favorite places to eat where I know the food is always consistent and tasty. Whether you have a big or small appetite, Del Seoul offers something for everyone.Their shrimp tacos are my favorite followed by Kalbi tacos. I recently tried their spicy tofu hot pot which was perfect for a nice chilly afternoon. The broth in the hot pot had tons of flavor considering there wasn't too much meat or seafood in the pot. It was definitely heavily tofu but then...it is called ""tofu"" hotpot and not ""seafood/beef"" hotpot. 'I love their garlic aioli and their seasoned fries are always spot on. They have recently added some new items on the menu - chicken wings and fries with short ribs and other delicious sounding toppings which I can't wait to try! I always introduce my friends to this place and all of them have loved it and shared the love with others!"
"Stopped in for a quick lunch, and we were amazed!Friendly staff, and a decent area to wait while you decide what you'd like (this is something I find important because I hate to feel rushed or that I am in the way). We tried the poutine to share which could have been enough for lunch itself! Very filling and a lot of great flavors going on - definitely worth trying. My fiance had the pork and chicken tacos, and I tried the short rib tacos. Everything was very flavorful and filling. Would highly recommend!"
First time here and I was blown away wish how delicious everything was. Perfect amount of spice with a perfect pair of sweetness! Had the shrimp tacos and the short rib tacos! can't wait to go back!
"There was a time when I dragged everyone I knew to have the fish taco and shrimp taco here. Fresh, perfectly fried, and well put together. A year and a half ago they stopped frying fresh when you ordered and the taco looked like it was messily thrown together in a rush. Now they seem to have compromised and returned to telling customers it would take time to fry the fish taco(if they don't, ask them to prepare it fresh), but I've never been able to get a preparation of fresh lettuce, warm taco shells, and sauce as nice as in the past.In short: They're still good for these items, but they're now just an occasional visit place for me. Other menu items are just okay."
"absolutely try this place!!! this place is so good and really unique. the tacos are great and you must try the fries with all the delish toppings on em. This place is super affordable too which makes it an awesome quick dinner spot. I wouldn't take a date here unless its a stop before going out. You will get your food quick, so it's definitely a fast food korean place. Must try it out!!!"
"When I heard about Korean tacos being available in Lakeview I was very excited.  Unfortunately they didn't live up to my asian/latin fusion dream. I've had plenty of bulgogi and bibimbap and Del Seoul's was mediocre and without much atmosphere to save the experience.HOWEVER what saves Del Seoul from a mediocre 3 star review is their poutin, kimchi-and-pork-belly slathered french fries that I just could not get enough of. They match the comfort, perfect bite of blended flavors that bibimbap delivers only using french fries as the base and less veggies. I didn't finish my tacos, but I licked my fingers after the last crumb of poutin was gone."
"This is my hangover go-to. Some like McDonald's, some prefer a brunch at one of the many offered in the city, some even use a coffee-Adderall combo to fight that blaring headache and conquer the enemy that is mental sluggishness. When I've had a rough night, my wake up routine starts with me forcing myself to drink as much water asI can hold, lay down on the couch, jump on my iPhone and start to choose a hefty meal. I usually can care less how much I spend on food when I'm in this state, so I order aimlessly, especially from Del Seoul. This is a usual request:-3 shrimp tacos-1 fish taco-1 order of dumplings-1 order of Kimchi friesUsually comes out to around $30 including a $3 delivery charge. Oh, and tip.. but like I said, price is irrelevant at this point. When I get the goods, I usually grab a few of the fries first, hit 2 of the shrimp tacos, throw in a dumpling, hit the fish taco, another dumpling, etc. Mixing and matching each delicious flavor until the array of Korean gloriousness is no more. I then fall into hibernation to escape the bite of winter and wake in time for summer's smile. In all seriousness, Del Seoul is delicious. Even if you're not hungover. The corn tortilla tacos, steamed dumplings, Korean chicken wings and Kimchi fries are my personal favorites. I've never mustered up the courage to shy away from my normal items, because they sufficiently do the trick every time. Love this place."
The best bnah mi ever!!! The food is yummy. This place is always full and after months of trying I finally got in and it was worth it.
"Del Seoul is an attempt to marry Korean food with Mexican food. And it does a decent job.I was excited to try the tacos; they were okay, but I feel like I've made better Korean tacos at home. The pork belly fries were good, but they made me feel a little gross afterward.I probably won't come back here if I'm ever in the Windy City again, but it's cheap and I'd probably come by once in awhile if I lived in Chicago."
"My favorite place to have lunch in the Lincoln Park neighborhood. Most of the dishes are excellent and I have very few gripes. Some specifics:Tacos - great. The shrimp tacos contain large, delicious shrimp coated in a nice, soft batter and topped with a sweet chili sauce. These are the standouts among the tacos. The BBQ pork and shortrib tacos are also excellent. My only criticism is that the double corn tortillas slightly interfere with the deliciousness contained inside. Sometimes, I just peel off one of the tortillas.Bulgogi Banh Mi - one of my usual orders. Lots of bulgogi contained in this sandwich that is tender, slightly sweet, and perfectly marinated. Picked daikon on top is great. French bread is crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, as it should be.Bulgogi Bento Box - excellent again. Meat comes out sizzling on an iron skillet with onions. Meat is juicy, tender, and delicious. Salad and rice on the side are good. I kind of miss the large iron skillets they formerly used, as the rice used to arrive right on the skillet and get nice and crispy on the bottom and mix in a little bit with the beef juices.Chicken Wings - man, they really slather the sauce on these things, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. The sauce is really good - tangy and sweet. Eight wings might not sound like a lot, but they get pretty feeling. Kalbi Poutine - not going to touch it. I don't care if it's delicious. I am Canadian and I eat my poutine pure.Kimchi - excellent, one of the more flavorful kimchis I've had. Great to get as a small side for one dollar. The kimchi fries are also excellent and best if shared.Service - order at the counter, get your food in a few minutes. Not much to say here.Overall, a truly great place for lunch. Occasionally, I get a little tired of his place, so my regularity in coming here waxes and wanes, but I can't deny that the food is excellent. 5 stars."
"It's a nice fusion place. The atmosphere is creative and comfortable. Staff was real pleasant and the speed of the order to your table was not a problem. The tacos were solid. Loved the flour tortillas and you could really taste the marinade of the kalbi tacos. I noticed some traditional Korean meals on the menu, which I'm sure are just as good. I'll be back here ASAP."
This is my second place here. It is kind of loud here so it will be better to hang out with friends. The food is very good and kind of self-service styles.
"OK an update from my previous review. Not only is the Sesame Chili Shimp amazing, but now I have also tried the Sambal Fish Taco's and the Seasoned Gamja fries. Wholly hell, they are amazing and might just be my new favorites. That being said, I'm wondering if there is a bad thing on the menu? I'm thinking not! As a side note, wow, I love this place!!!"
"I visit this place pretty often as I get my hair cut next door. The Sesami-Chili Shrimp taco is a must-have on every visit as it is simply the bomb! (Pardon my late 90s slang, but this taco calls for it.) The Kalbi is excellent as well! Yesterday I tried the Spicy BBQ Pork taco and it was not bad. It wasn't spicy at all in my opinion, it was more tangy, which is actually how they describe it. The Spicy BBQ Chicken is not bad either, but also not spicy.I think I'll stick to the shrimp and Kalbi tacos in the future, but I do look forward to trying the kimchi fries, steak banh mi sandwich, and maybe the dumplings. All in all a great spot! If you're not extremely hungry I recommend you start with 2 tacos, as they're pretty filling. The tacos come out within minutes so you can always get another one."
"Alright, I'm not usually any big fan of shrimp, but the shrimp tacos here? MONEY. if you're Korean: it has a flavoring and texture akin to the gganpoong saewoo you find at your standard Korean-Chinese joint. The other tacos are good, too, but they really don't hold a candle to the shrimp tacos. The kimchi fries are definitely worth a nosh -- although they really load down that basket with the patatas, so waistlines beware."
"Del Seoul is an ingenious alteration of Korean cuisine.There's a few traditional dishes, but the craze is all about the Korean tacos, bbq sandwiches, and the kimchi fries. Go for the sesame-chili shrimp tacos and the kalbi tacos. I also recommend the bulgolgi sandwich. If you're not adventurous, you could always settle for the bibimbap, or the soondubu, or even the straight up bbq meats. Overall, this place is pretty unique, and the price tags won't hurt your wallet too much.  The tacos are no more than four bucks each and the sandwiches are around seven bucks."
Absolutely awesome. The tacos are to kill for. The fries are great too. The kimchee ones are actually better than the bulgogi fries but it might be a personal thing.
As a first timer I can say that it won't be my last time coming here! The other reviews were very helpful with deciding what to order. The cashier was also very helpful and friendly! Waiting time was short which was great due to my starvation! Can't wait to return!
"I don't like this place that much compared to how my friends are in love with it, but I guess I'll give stars.... Pros:They have poutine!!!! Tasty food Cons:Pricey :( Serving size is small for the price If you're taking a car, good luck with finding a parking spot. It's always busy."
"Juat ate here for the for at time, and I will definitely be back. I had the shrimp, sandal and bbq pork tacos. All wrre amazing and for $10 its reasonably priced.  The food was ready instantly. I have absolutely no complaints."
"Korean tacos!!! This is my first time trying korean tacos, but since I'm from LA, I should have tried the Kogi taco truck by now as a comparison.  I ordered the sesame-chilli shrimp, sambal fish, and spicy BBQ pork and thought they were pretty good.  I did think the tacos lacked the extra kick that actual tacos have (lime and tomatoes) since it was just shredded cabbage and/or lettuce or their ""secret slaw"" in their respective sauces.  I thought the shrimp was sort of lacking since it was just 2 itty bitty shrimps.  For the price you pay (~2.75$ each), that's not worth it.  Sorry, I'm too accustomed to tacos being $1-$1.25!  I also ordered the kim chi fries, but also found it lacking in pork belly.  More like overpriced cheese fries in my opinion.  Despite the quantity, the quality was good.  The flour tortillas didn't come out greasy.  They also have other dishes (tofu soup) that are not posted on their website/on their printed menu."
"I've tried all of their tacos and I love all of them! I especially love their kimchi fries too. I have to get their fries no matter what when I come here. It may be a little on the pricey side for tacos but other than that, I love it! The service is pretty good and fast for the most part too."
"I like this place most of the time. Food is mostly solid/good. Staff just looks like they are having a miserable time and that also shows in their customer service. If you're going to vacantly stare into space and have the look of complete disdain on your face,then be aware it will be very noticeable in public. Also forgetting orders is usually a bummer and take what seems 10 extra minutes and 2 reminders to bring it out sucks also."
I've been to this place since it opened. I was genuinely happy they were expanding not too long after opening. Everything on the menu is just amazing. (Except my bowl of rice were pretty old and dry. But I didn't complain) Very authentic considering the people who work there. But service wise it's a huge FAIL. I came in and ordered my food without a line. The girl at the register was just unpleasant. I thought maybe it's not a good day for her. 10-15 min later my good arrived. The guy literally just threw my food on the table. I said thank you he didn't say anything. Please pay attention to your service!
"Food was amazing here. Everything was quick and good. I would recommend the Korean chicken wings! :) and there popular fries they make, I forgot the name. One thing that bother was how they served people who order first, instead of people who come in first.  I was a tourist and ordering at a restaurant I've never been too is a challenge. But overall it was a good experience."
"I finally have a chance to try this place! Their shrimp taco is a must! However, their tacos are quite small so you might have to order three."
"I will start out by saying that I am not a huge fan of fusion restaurants. This place was too over-hyped for me. The price will not break the bank but I think it just a little too expensive subject to what they are serving. Especially when their serving sizes are closer to the smaller size.  If you go, order the kimchi fries. They are definitely something different and a dish you will not find anywhere else."
yum. soooo gooodddd
"Walking into this restaurant, we were not sure what to order, so we checked there lists of favorites. Boy was it good!!!  My favorite dishes were the Chicken Wings,  Kalbi Poutine, and the Banh mi!!! Each had there own unique taste yet very refreshing. I totally would recommend this place!!"
Overpriced for what u get. Weak sauce that they charge an extra 25c for a tiny cup of sauce for the fries. Just make the tiny extra sauce free! Don't be greedy Del Seoul. Tasty tho
"This place was no joke!I came here and ordered four different items and prepared to slam...-Sesame-Chili Shrimp Taco. It was good just not great, probably due to the fact that the other taco I ordered was just unreal. I rate this taco 7/10..-Sambal Fish Taco. Whoa buddy was this taco good. The fish was huge and tasty with a perfect batter and the sauce and condiments really completed the entire taco. Damn good. 10/10!!!-Seoul Style Street Dumplings. While these dumplings were good, they just can't compare to the dumplings I've had in Bridgeport/Chinatown. Good not great, but would still eat them again. 7/10..And finally, the best part of the meal was the K-Town Chicken Wings...Holy wings that deserved to be blessed they are so damn good. They were crispy on the exterior and moist and juicy on the inside. The sweet soy, the glaze, the hint of spice, damn these wings were just so good. 10/10!!!All in all this place is slamming. The prices were cool and the people and place was nice as well. The only drawback is the parking, but that is everywhere in this hood'!!!Enjoy Suckas'!!!"
Seriously love their kalbi taco and shrimp taco!! Omg if you can only eat one taco! Get the shrimp!! It's sooo goood!!!
Love the shrimp tacos! The food so far has been consistently good and the customer service is great! The food also comes quickly.  The food is very moderately priced.This place just needs to be BYOB lol
"Wow.  Freaking amazing food!  Ordered the chicken wings, pork tacos, chicken tacos, kalbi tacos, kimchi fries, and a side of kimchi for good measure.  This korean fusion street food joint is so good and believe the hype, this place is legit.  Our favorites were definitely the pork and chicken tacos (more tender vs the kalbi).  Can't wait for my next Chicago trip to eat here again!"
"I'm addicted to the sesame-chili shrimp tacos. I was so happy to find they have the same in the form of a sandwich (more filing). The Kalbi poutine is good, but a bit pricey for the portion. The gamja fries are more than fairly priced, though and go nicely with a couple of tacos. The staff is usually friendly and the food is pretty quick. I'm stoked a place like this is in my neighborhood."
"I had been wanting to try this restaurant for quite some time and finally made it in last night. After talking with a handful of people and reading all the Yelp reviews I had really hyped this place up in my head.... and it lived up to my expectations!! For a little background, I'm an extremely picky eater, I have a pretty low tolerance for spice and I was a little nervous about how I would like Korean food. And needless to say Del Seoul has won me over!! I order a chicken taco, pork taco and the kimchi fries. All were amazing! My husband had the shrimp, chicken and short rib tacos. He liked all of them but said the short rib was a little chewy. Their service was also great - we walked in and were greeted with a smile, the cashier answered a few questions we had and the food came quick and hot. Del Seoul will definitely be added into my regular rotation."
This place is disgusting!!!  I am so sick to my stomach just thinking about the so called Korean infused tacos. First they were cold! Second they were covered in oil!  And third they were covered in a bunch of mayo with some sort of salty lettuce. I don't recommend this place to anyone. I can't believe they have so many positive reviews. By the way the front of the house girls should smile a little more often.
"As far as food from the northside goes, the price and taste seems pretty average.We ordered the spicy seafood tofu and it was delicious. Though, there should be a warning that shellfish have shells so beware of what you bite... (I caught a few shells.)The wings were pretty good too. Adequately spiciness and crispiness. The tacos in my opinion were a bit overpriced. We did order a few though. They were pretty good. I have yet to have that craving to come back for it.If anything, I might come back for the spicy seafood tofu. :)This place needs to expand! Though people seem to order to go during the dinner hour that I went. It was pretty crowded."
Was contacted and told a gift card was on the way never got it so sad I told all my friends about this place and they continue to let me down...
"Del Seoul is absolutely one of my favorite spots to eat in the city. I probably eat here at least once or twice a week. It's fair to say that I have eaten almost everything they offer on their menu and nothing has disappointed me yet. My mother is Korean so I am very familiar with traditional Korean foods such as kalbi, bulgogi, pork bulgogi, and mandu (dumplings) and Del Seoul's are all good. My favorite Korean dish they serve is the dolsot bibimbop. Whenever I order bibimbop I usually order a cup of miso soup to start with, which is also very delicious. For specializing in Korean tacos it's safe to say their regular Korean fare is just as good as other Korean restaurants in the city.All of the Korean tacos are amazing! I have tried every single one and they are all good. My absolute favorite is the sesame-chili shrimp taco, followed by the kalbi taco, the spicy bbq pork taco, the sambal fish taco, and then the spicy bbq chicken taco. Whenever i get tacos I always order the seasoned gamja fries with them. They are seasoned to perfection and come with an awesome garlic-sesame aioli. If you are a heavy dipper I recommend getting an extra aioli. I have also had the kimchi fries which are really good, but they are of a bigger portion and cost $5 more then the gamja fries. The newest menu item, the K-town chicken wings are also really good. I definitely recommend them to any wing lover looking for a different tasting wing to try. The only items I have yet to try are the Korean BBQ sandwiches and the spicy tofu soup. I am sure I will try these out eventually on one of my many visits to Del Seoul."
"My friend told me this place was amazing, and I took his offer to try it. I mean, I'm from LA (home of Korean tacos), and I did not expect too much. It was better than I thought, but not on par with LA, of course. The galbi taco was okay, I found the meat to be a bit dry for my taste. The bulgogi taco was absolutely awesome though -- great texture, not dry and very tasty.The wait for the food is not too bad either, but there are limited tables and chairs. The staff were really nice and prompt with the orders. I would come here again if I am back in Chicago."
"I love asian fusion because of the creativity and blend of flavors. It's always so pleasing when I discover a complementary blend of flavors that I would have never thought of on my own. This place did not disappoint. The tacos were pretty amazing. They came with plenty of fillings. The fish taco had large pieces of fish in it. The shrimp taco were juicy and reasonably large. I would have preferred to have less mayo on my shrimp. In my shrimp sandwich, I had already asked for no mayo on the bread so I was surprised at how much mayo the shrimp was tossed with. Next time, I'll skip the mayo completely and see how well the shrimps are on their own."
"I don't know if it was all the shot skis at Crossroads or the delightful smells that hit you as soon as you walk in, but I'm in love. A friend of mine lives in the area and brought us to this place after the sushi place down the street had a ridiculously long wait. I am beyond thankful of this choice because not only was it cheap with lightning fast service, it was delicious!My friend took my food originally (read: drunk and hungry) so I got to try one of his fish tacos and it was just the right amount of crunch with a SUBLIME amount of flavor. For my next 2 tacos, I got the shrimp taco and the short rib taco which were just as delectable as the fish. The slaw and cilantro that they put on these tacos is LEGEN...wait for it...DARY. Add a little squirt of sriracha and you've got bliss.Last but not least, please for the love of God get the Kimchi Fries. Don't try to tackle them by yourself, find someone to share them with but they are amazing (especially after the day drinking...)Next time I'm in town, day drunk or sober, this place is on my list. I'm dying to try the Banh Mi and the Bibimbop!"
"What happens when you take Honey Walnut Shrimp and place it into a taco?  You get Del Seoul's Sesame Chili Taco.  I tried all their other proteins for the Korean taco and I can tell you don't even bother -- it doesn't match in flavor or texture that the shrimp taco delivers. We also got to try their Kimchi Fries and Korean Dumplings.  They're good, but not  standouts like the shrimp taco."
"It took countless recommendations and even a friend visiting from out of town who pushed for a Del Seoul visit to finally get me in here, and my oh my I am forever changed. Del Seoul shares a special place in my food-loving heart (right next to bopNgrill).Korean and Mexican fusion never sounded appealing to me but Del Seoul mashes the two so perfectly well with their tacos, the bento boxes do not disappoint, and the bibimbop is quality. We got several of the shrimp tacos (highly recommended and what they're known for), the kalbi bento box, some kimchi fries to share, and the hot stone bibimbop. The shrimp taco had the crunch of the shrimp along with the sweetness of the sesame chili. The kalbi was well-cooked and came with a side of rice and another side that tasted good but to this day we have yet to actually figure out it was. There's nothing to really write home about with the bibimbop since you can definitely find better but I didn't expect a life-changing bowl. It did the job. The kimchi fries... I don't know if we took too long munching on the other items but by the time someone paid attention to the fries they have already started melding together, had become extremely soggy, and we ultimately didn't finish. I tried it again during a second visit and have decided that bopNgrill still serves a better version.Do yourselves a favor: 1)  visit often  2) try everything on the menu. I'm sensitive to heat but nothing was too spicy. If you're confused about something on the menu just ask the friendly staff (the owners are usually there as well).Prices are low when compared to other Lincoln Park eateries. Portions are adequate and they have dishes to share if you have a big party. It's on my list of places to return to since I've yet to try their poutine. Good eats!"
"This one was truly tough. I wanted to give it five stars. The food, the wait staff, and the BoH deserve it. I am a huge fan of everything on the menu from the tacos, to the tasty sides, to the bento boxes. This is picky but I have to take a star off for the layout of the restaurant. The flow seems off and the arrangement of the chairs and tables seem like it's missing the same care and thought that went into creating all of the delicious menu items. However, other than that, the issue is minor and certainly doesn't detract from the rest of the food or the service."
"Even though the shrimp taco was a minor disappointment, the tempura fish tacos and kalbi poutine were so good that I'll be back.  If this place was BYO, it would be magic...as is, it's just really good food.  Yessir!"
"For folks like me who love Korean food and love authentic Mexican tacos, the craze in recent years for Korean tacos, a food-truck staple in a bunch of towns now, seems like either a culinary abomination or a beautiful dream.Anyway, I'd been wanting to find out for myself for a long time, but living in a city like Cincinnati, Ohio, doesn't exactly present you with the opportunity, and we somehow kept missing them during our travels to somewhat more exotic places.  I did try a single dubious ""Korean taco"" at a local Asian Food Fest, but the obviously subpar execution made me write that one off as a misfire.So we popped into the rather unassuming and dark Del Seoul in Chicago.  And after consuming their sesame chili shrimp (""Our BEST taco!"") and kalbi tacos, I'm onboard with the concept.  At $3, these things are piled high on corn tortillas with your choice of meat or seafood, a ""cilantro onion slaw,"" and a kimchi-ish ""secret slaw.""  Big flavors that balance well.  My only complaint is that the shrimp, while tasty, were slightly overfried, and the kalbi might have gotten lost in the shuffle a bit.  But I'd be happy to chow down on these just about any time....Del Seoul does some Korean standards like bibimbap and Korean BBQ.  The wife got the dolsot bibambap and it was very serviceable for $10."
"I can't get enough of the Taco's here.  If you are looking for cheap food that tastes great, you should check this place out."
"Best tacos ever!!! Omg, the flavor and the savory taste beats every taco that I have ever eaten. The sauce that they use in their tacos is not like any other taco. A bit pricey, but after one bite, you won't even mind it. When I came here for the first time, I was not even hungry. Somehow eating these tacos triggered my appetite, and they were just just so so good!"
"Zomg. I love this place! I can really only speak for the BBQ tacos & Gamja fries because that's all I get but they are soo amazing. The fries are my favorite ever! And the BBQ chicken tacos are so fresh and flavorful, it's awesome."
"I wish I could give this ten stars. The shrimp tacos would absolutely be in my last meal. I am currently living out of the country and dream about these on a regular basis. When I was in for Christmas, my husband tried the poutine, which was awesome as well. Also a big fan of the steamed potstickers. Need to stop writing now as my mouth is watering. Just go, get 2 tacos (three if you're feeling crazy), and BLOW YOUR OWN MIND."
"I've been meaning to write a review for this place for a while.First, it only has one $ sign for price, but the price can add up quickly if you have a big appetite.  One bite and you will.  I really enjoyed the kimchee fries and the kalbi taco.  The kimchee tacos reminded me of a Korean person's take on the classic nachos, if french fries were substituted for the nachos.  Take a plate full of fries, toss them around with Korean seasoning and sprinkle with kimchee and other toppings.  The kalbi taco was pretty good too.  I want to come back for the shrimp tacos.I actually ordered the shrimp tacos too, but my dining partner ate them all while I went to get napkins or utensils or something.  So keep that in mind.  Take the shrimp tacos with you if you need to get up to get something.  So while I wasn't able to taste them, the person who did said they were excellent.The place is very casual and it looks like a place that a lot of people would order take out from.  There are a good number of seats and the food comes out relatively quickly.  Judging by the sheer number of reviews, I wouldn't be surprised if a line forms quickly for this place.Highly recommend that you check this place out if you want something different and you're in the area.  Parking can be difficult, but there are usually some spots on that side street up north a few blocks near where the Best Buy is."
"This place is great for a quick, cheap and casual meal. Their shrimp tacos are fantastic. I have had a few of the other tacos and po boys, and they were all good, but the shrimp tacos are by far the best."
Delicious!  As a Korean BBQ novice- I was taking a leap of faith in trying the menu items at Del Seoul.  They didn't disappoint!  My fiance and I ordered sesame-chili shrimp tacos and fries to go and it was awesome.  The aioli and slaw were a great complement to the panko breaded shrimp.  The fries were seasoned to perfection with a yummy dipping sauce.  We were hesitant to order our meal to go as it says on the menu that tacos and fries may be soggy (how considerate of them to say that!)-but the food survived our walk home and managed to keep it's overall yumminess.  We're looking forward to trying more on the menu!
"No it's not authentic Korean food and it's certainly not gourmet- but who cares? Del Seoul is innovative, inexpensive, and damn tasty.The bahn mi was delicious without being revolutionary. The kalbi was salty-sweet and succulent. But the real delight at Del Seoul are the tacos, pairing corn (!) tortillas with Asian fillings.  Best fish taco I've ever had, battered and freshly fried with a spicy sauce and pickled red onions to cut the richness.  Delicious for a snack or meal- just be prepared for a long line during peak hours!"
"One of the worst eating experiences of my life. As I bit into my taco, I noticed a LIVE cock roach on it. I quickly dropped my taco and grabbed the cock roach that was now crawling across my plate and showed it to the person at the counter.  He apologized.  I can only imagine how dirty their kitchen must be.  This is sad because the food tastes so good. I don't think that I will ever return."
"Ok, so I'm a huge fan of street food. Incorporate ""fusion"" and I'm sold. So I was super excited to  get to Del Seoul and see if their take on Korean street food made the cut. Ummm...why yes, yes it does. Delicious.Hubs and I got the fish taco and spicy BBQ pork taco to share. Yum, yum, yum. They were both delicious but I have to say the fish had a slight advantage as the favorite. The picked onion, slaw, and aioli combo can't be beat. I love Bahn Mi sandwiches and have had them at other Korean street food places around the city. I think I've found my new spot. The bread is perfect. Not too crusty, not too soft. Just perfect. And finally, Kimchi fries. Onions, pork, cheese, sour cream, fries, kimchi. Nuff said. And IT IS DELICIOUS. Just go. Try. You will not be disappointed."
"Get the shrimp tacos and kimchi fries!! This place is incredible, a fusion of Korean and Latin American food. I have gone (and will continue to go) every time I've been to Chicago.  My friend ordered the hot pot and said it was great as well. It's always been packed with Koreans-- a good sign for the authenticity, even though it's a fusion place. The place is a little small and can be crowded, but it's worth it."
"Get: the shrimp taco!  I got one of those and one of the fish.  I liked the shrimp one better but the fish was good too.  Keep in mind it is fried (as are the shrimp).  Sadly I think the tacos are a bit overloaded.  There isn't a way to really pick them up and bite into them without everything falling out.  Still yummy though.  Skip: the kimchi fries.  Honestly, the kimchi didn't add much.  Perhaps I'm just not a fan of it to start with.  The fries however are perfection.  So get those with the garlic dipping sauce."
"I love going there cause the food is awesome. Today was my off day so I just want to grab the tacos and the French fries. As soon as I enter, this black woman who is a cashier is rude because she have me a attitude just because I'm deaf. So I just left cause I don't feel welcome.Edited:Came back last Sunday after a long hiatus and thought it was a good place to eat after my workout. It was packed but I decided to go in anyway, a different cashier was friendly and got my order correctly. The food came quickly unexpectedly even when so many people are line up. Overall, I chow down my food happily and left with a happy tummy and a happy customer."
"The best shrimp and fish tacos I've ever tasted. This is my favorite go to spot when I'm in town and I crave a taco. The wings are also soooo tasty! Their service is awesome, the portions are perfect, and you'll walk outta here feelin truly satisfied!  I LOVE this place!"
"Love this place...I will literally sit in rush hour traffic coming from the suburbs just to ease a craving for this.Kalbi tacos and kimchi fries are all I've eaten here, and I have never been disappointed. I don't even want to write a long review because my mouth is watering as I write this and because it's 3 in the morning, there will be no respite for the hungry :("
"Friendly workers, young crowd, and amazing tasting Kimchi fries, Kalbi tacos & Shrimp tacos!"
"I really like the tacos here because the meat are full of flavors and they're relatively cheap.  I thought the dumplings were fine, not too awesome but not terrible either. I wasn't very impressed with the kimchi pork belly fries that everyone raved about. To me, it was just a soggy mess of sour cream and cheese. It was very hard to discern the kimchi from the dairy taste. Not only that, I didn't find a single piece of pork belly in the mix. Maybe it got lost in the ocean of cheese and sour cream. Who knows?"
One of the best Korean food I've had in Chicago.
"Kimchi Fries: Wonderful, but kimchi to fries ratio was like 30:70, which was disappointing to me.Tacos: All flavours were fresh and very tasty, though I agree with Toby B. that it's not so much ""Korean"" food as it is just tacos that have been substituted with some Korean ingredients. Service: Friendly and very niceTook off one star because it is too pricey for me to come here everyday ($4/taco or more) and it's not very near the train station."
"Alright I'm a fan of Kimchi and I sure do love fries, then I heard from a friend there is such thing in Chicago. I researched and didn't find Kimchi Fries in NYC, so Del Seoul was added to my ""To Eat"" agenda for Chicago.It was a bit of a travel from the Loop area, but it wasn't too bad. The place seemed small, until I realized there's another part of the dining area on the right side. The decor was very minimal. The ambiance was welcoming with young and elderly dining at the time we were there. You need to place your order first and they'll give you a table number and tell you where to sit.I checked out their menu and was interested in their Banh Mi. It's not everyday I get to try a Banh Mi at a Korean place, like their menu even stated, ""Korean BBQ meets Vietnamese Banh Mi Sandwich."" So I gotten the Spicy BBQ Pork, which the pork was marinated with Korean Gochujang (red chili powder, glutinous rice powder mixed with powdered femented soybeans and salt). The Vietnamese side of things - toasted baguette with mayo was toasted just right and it was crispy, the cilantro, pickled carrots and daikon were really fresh. The Korean side of this sandwich - the spicy bbq pork was tender and flavorful, but I felt the spicy level can bump up another level or two. Other than that this Koretnamese sandwich was good enough.Next thing I had my eye on was the Kalbi (grilled beef short rib) taco topped with chopped lettuce, sesame and chili flakes. This taco was amazingly good! The Kalbi was very very flavorful and tender. The tacos were soft, just the way I like them. The taco can be really messy, but that's the fun of it.And finally the Kimchi Fries that I traveled 714 miles for was...*drum roll*...disappointing. I mean the fries alone was actually pretty good - it was crispy and flavorful, so I give them credit for that. These fries were topped with Kimchi, onions, scallions, melted Cheddar and Jack, sour cream and pork belly. Pork belly? Really? Where? Too bad I left my magnifying glass in NYC or else I might have spotted some. Alright, so the Kimchi was there, but it was stuck to the cheese, but not to the fries. So shouldn't that just be Kimchi cheese over fries? Because my fries ain't getting any love from the Kimchi...I literally had to tear the Kimchi cheese and attach it to the fries each time I took a bite. And I feel the Kimchi needed to be spicier than that. I guess I had too much high hopes for this. If I return to Chitown, I wouldn't mind trying out their other tacos, which seemed to be really good compared to the other things I've tried."
"Quite possibly the best Korean fushion food in the city. Seriously, I have dreams abt their shrimp tacos."
"First time having Poutine and if you've never had Poutine, have the Poutine. The table ordered lots of different things and I got a sampling of quite a few. The dumplings were wonderful, the wings were yummy (and messy), the meat on the bahn mi was great and my poutine was draw dropping amazing. Did i mention you should get the poutine?"
"I've been here a number of times. The first visit was a few years back, and I remember liking their banh mi. I went back again recently and fell back in love with the food. Their chicken wings are sweet, spicy, and beautifully fried. I mean, how can you lose with fried wings drenched in a tangy sauce?! I also loved the green onions thrown on top for a little flair. The fries are amazing. I ordered the kalbi tacos as well... also marvelous. I think the dumplings were okay and have had better. Overall, this place is a crowd pleaser, and the budget-friendly prices make me smile extra hard!"
"It's hard to keep up with Anthony Bourdain's shows because I feel like the name changes every season, but I recently watched the ""Los Angeles"" episode of his most recent show and it was completely and entirely devoted to Korea Town.  The episode featured a Korean-American artist who adamantly refuses to date or marry Korean women because of HAN.  Han is like this dark energy that apparently every Korean born person has to struggle with for their entire existence. According to Wikipedia and the show itself HAN is described as a ""feeling of unresolved resentment against injustices suffered, a sense of helplessness because of the overwhelming odds against one, a feeling of acute pain in one's guts and bowels, making the whole body writhe and squirm, and an obstinate urge to take revenge and to right the wrong--all these combined.""[1]In some occasions, anthropologists have recognized han as a culture-specific medical condition whose symptoms include dyspnea, heart palpitation, and dizziness. Someone who dies of han is said to have died of hwabyeong.So why do I bring this up?  Because I'm Korean and I'm starting to think that HAN, although totally insane to experience, can be used in a positive and productive way.  And if you can't handle the juice then you might as well try and dilute it by going to places that will neutralize the HAN.  Del Seoul does this for me.  The shrimp and fish tacos are all very tasty and you definitely will bob your head in agreement after your first bite acknowledging that this was a good decision, but if you dig deeper you will find that the wings are perfect blend of sweet and salty.  Add a little rooster and it actually mellows out all of the flavors contrary to how it sounds.  The whole point of the show was to explain the imbalance of why Korean Food took so long to be accepted in the American culinary mainstream it's because Koreans are actually acutely sensitive and it was perceived that if a foreigner cringed at a bite of some fermented stew then the maker would be hurt and say who needs you.  That might be a bit much, but I digress. I used to live in K-Town and in the episode they overly sensationalized Sizzler as the perfect restaurant for Korean Americans back in the day.  Every time I walked past by Sizzler I would always create this skit in my head where I am asking a really hot girl to go out and have Sizzler with me - as a bit.  ""Hey baby, I'll take you to Sizzler"" was my go to line.  And now I'm thinking, maybe K-Town is kind of schwag.  That sh*t is not cool, Sizzler SUCKS.  Go eat here."
This would be 5 stars if only they could omit the meat from the loaded fries. I had the regular fries which were amazing. I love everything about this unassuming taco joint. I had the fish and the shrimp tacos. Wow. Delicious with a little spice. The kind of heat that I like!I don't know if this qualifies as a hidden gem - it's def a gem.
"YES. If I lived closer, I'd eat half of my meals here. Get like 10 orders of the shrimp taco's. That's all you need. Some kimchi fries if you want, but all you really need are the shrimp tacos."
"I love how simple Korean food has become. Korean BBQ can be pretty complicated, but new twists on traditional dishes have really made Korean less of a mystery to unfamiliar diners.We flew into Chicago late in the evening and I was craving Korean food. We looked up possible eats and stumbled on Del Seoul. Our decision to try it out did not disappoint.We got a kalbi taco, shrimp taco, dol-sot bibimbap and the dumplings. Everything was awesome! I would come back here again and again. And again. I loved the way everything was flavored and the classic Korean spices and ingredients were used really well. I loved the food!"
SUPER YUM is what I have to say. The fries and shrimp tacos were totally amazing!!!
"Del Seoul, I have returned! A few of us were in the area for some errands and we decided to stop by for a quick bite. I was actually pretty full from dim sum earlier but I just couldn't turn down these little Korean-infused tacos. I had an order of the Sambal fish taco and aloe vera drink. This huge chunk of fish was perfectly fried with a paper-thin, crispy crust. Atop were pickled red onions, Napa slaw, and spicy Sambal sauce.  I'm not a fan of onions but I could barely taste the red onions. That's a plus! The Sambal sauce was very subtle. A few drops of Sriracha sauce would've put in the finishing touches."
"I lived in Boston for two years. Diversity in Boston is when a New England-born white guy from Boston College hangs out from another New England-born white guy from Boston University.  After two years of that inbred Patriots-loving nonsense, seeing the mix of patrons in this restaurant was like a soothing balm for my bleeding heart liberal soul.  You could have taken a picture of the place and put it on a brochure for ITT Tech.  There were Indian families, black families, gay couples, straight couples, and groups of friends that covered the spectrum of skin color, Carrot Top White to Wesley Snipes black.  It made me want to punch Ayn Rand in the stomach.  All this in a Korean restaurant, no less.The food here was fine.  The shrimp in the soon dobu wasn't de-shelled or de-veined.  Prices were extremely reasonable.  Four stars because the place looks like a Benetton ad come to life.  I love this city."
"great delicious tacos.  reasonably priced.  tons of flavor.  Its quick service, so won't take long.  Place def gets busy at night.Def try the shrimp taco, excellent sauce.  Also added is kimchi fried rice.  Def on point.Def worth checking out if your in Lincoln Park neighborhood."
"I kind of feel like this place is overrated. I've heard great things about their kim chee fries and my mom was visiting (she loves Korean food) so I figured why not, let's try this place out. I have never been a fan of Asian fusion. I'm not sure why, but after hearing so many good things, I decided to give this type of food another try. We ordered the kim chee fries, dumplings, the shrimp banh mi, and the pork belly. The kim chee fries were whatever. You couldn't even taste the kim chee! We ended up throwing it out because it was too oily and heavy. The dumplings were alright, but they literally tasted like the Ling Ling potstickers from Costco. The banh mi was pretty good, which was probably the only highlight of this place. My mom ate the pork belly and it was just alright. It was very fatty (which I warned her about ahead of time), but it wasn't tasty enough to make the fattiness worth it. Overall, I probably won't be back. I definitely don't understand the hype."
"I love Del Seoul so much that I am taking time out of my extremely busy Friday evening of doing nothing to review it on Yelp. If you have either not been back here in a couple of years or haven't been at all, do yourself a favor and get your ass to Lincoln Park. They have extremely fresh, delicious menu items that are FULL of flavor. You cannot go wrong with the Shrimp Banh Mi or the shrimp anything. If you get 1 shrimp taco and 1 pork or 1 fish taco you will be so so mad at yourself. Just get the shrimp. It is to die for. The gamja fries w/ the aoli are mouthwatering ... I'm almost drooling just thinking about it. Did I mention the shrimp Banh Mi is the best banh mi in the city of Chicago? Because it is. Perfectly constructed, well balanced flavors/acidity, and heat from the fresh jalapenos. A couple of tips for you, my friends: This place can get busy. They have added more seating over the last couple of years but it is almost easier to just get takeout depending on the time of day. Call ahead your order to save time. There's nothing worse than standing in line smelling other people's delicious food when you are hungry. Now go!!"
"Omg sesame chili tacos, bulgogi, and kimchi fries. I am in HEAVEN. This place rocks it! I have been hooked for almost a year. I go extremely out of my way just to have 3 corn tacos (don't forget the sriracha!) with the most amazing flavors. Not a bad word to say on the service, speed, or variety of the menu. They semi-recently expanded their seating too, so the more the merrier! Don't forget to try the pot stickers too.One word for Del Seoul: AMAZE! Go try it b/c you won't be disappointed."
"Atmosphere: Cafeteria like but comfortable.Service: A bit rude. Food:Kalbi (Grilled Short Rib)- tasty.K Town Chicken Wings- sticky, dry, and kind of gross.Kimchi fries- pretty darn delicious.Conclusion: The meat was tasty and I enjoyed my meal but the service and chicken wings rubbed me the wrong way. I would return but I wouldn't go out of my way.3 stars."
"My family and I enjoy the food here. I love the stone bowl bibimbop. I always ask for extra gochujang (the red hot paste that comes with it) but they never give it to me unless I go back up to the counter to ask for it. My only disappointment here is the customer service. They're not always friendly, and they look annoyed, especially when I do ask for the extra gochujang or when we're trying to put together 2 tables for two to fit my family of 3 and all the food we just spent alot of money on. All in all, we like the food but we don't look forward to the service."
"Korean tacos? Nothing new in my house since I make them at home but I wanted to see Del Seoul's approach. We ordered the sambal fish, shrimp, and kalbi tacos, BBQ pork banh mi sandwich, and the kimchi fries. The sambal fish was breaded and had a similar texture to fish and chips. The fish was cooked well where the meat was moist and flaky. The kalbi (Korean marinated short ribs) reminded me more of a traditional bulgogi (Korean fire beef). Out of the three tacos, the shrimp taco stood out the most even though it didn't remind me of anything Korean. It's almost like a spicy shrimp tempura roll in taco form where the shrimp was breaded and served with a spicy mayo. The BBQ pork from the banh mi had a good grilled flavor but the bread was rather disappointing. With a banh mi sandwich, you expect a crunch from the French baguette but instead the bread was soft and chewy. Maybe the bread wasn't as fresh? Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the kimchi fries even though I am not a fan of kimchi. The kimchi was muted from the cheese and mayo and went really well together. I couldn't taste the pork belly as much but it was still good. Next time, I'll have to try the pork steamed dumplings.I appreciate that Del Seoul is presenting Korean flavors with an approach that is more familiar to those who have never had traditional Korean food. This is a great place to try if you are new to Korean cuisine. If you enjoyed Del Seoul, I would recommend venturing north to Korea Town."
"Absolutely LOVE this place. The shrimp is a must try. The spicy pork is awesome. The kalbi beef and beef bulgogi are on point. I recommend trying the dumplings, kimchi fries and the kalbi poutine. Sinfully delicious!!"
Delicious! Quick fast Korean food! Yummmm
"This place is awesome! Anywhere with awesome fusion food is a must-go for me. The Mexican/Korean flavors mixed together were outstanding. I really liked their bbq tacos but I would skip the kimchi fries next time. Also, be careful because my friend's bag was stolen when she was here."
"One of boyfriend's favorite places. We were really hungry. He got the Kalbi bento box and I got the veggie bibimbop. We also shared the shrimp and fish tacos and an order of the gamja fries.I loved the veggie bibimbop. Was fantastic, especially the mushrooms, sprouts, and beautiful egg on top. The Kalbi box was good too - apparently different from the last time he had gone, now with salad instead of bok choy (?). The side salad was actually fantastic though. Panko and some really good dressing, probably ginger?Shrimp taco was my favorite of the two. We could've gone without the fries. Really stuffed after but the bibimbop and bento box were perfect."
Bottom line: Fusion for a good price.Time: Lunch around noon.Occasion: Catch up with some friends. Party of 3.Service: Order and pick up.- Friendly people.- Ask for a recommendation.Food: Yum!- KBBQ tacos is the best thing ever!- Kim chi fries are awesome but they can get too cheese happy.- All the tacos are good. My favorite is the kalbi.Korean tacos is the best thing to ever happen!!! Chill place to eat good food with good company.
"I came here for the first time today and this place was pretty delicious! I got the new Kalbi fries which had such an amazing flavor and everything went together so well. The chilli shrimp taco, which on their menu says is their best taco and I believe it! It was delicious but the taste of the tortillas really overpowered the deliciousness inside, so I just didn't eat the tortilla. I also had the Kalbi taco which was nothing special and would not order it again. My friend got their tofu hotpot soup which was a little too spicy and had a little too much tofu. Kimchi was yummy."
"I'll admit, I love Korean BBQ food trucks and fusion places. So when I was given the option between Del Seoul or a ramen place for lunch options, I immediately chose Del Seoul. We went overboard with ordering and got:  - Kalbi & Spicy BBQ Pork Tacos: the kalbi had great flavoring, and the slaw on top was refreshing. They give a pretty generous portion of meat.- Spicy BBQ Pork Banh mi: my favorite part of the meal! great bread, pickled vegetables (daikon & carrots, yum!), and pork. The jalapenos are no joke either, so be sure to pick those out if you can't handle spicy. - Veggie Hot Stone Bibimbop: after they bring it out, wait a little while so the rice at the bottom of the stone gets nice and crispy. Can't go wrong with hot stone bibimbops if you love veggies.- Kimchi Fries: sadly I was pretty disappointed in these, because kimchi fries are usually my favorite. The cheese was a bit strange - I prefer spicy mayo instead, and there was a lack of kimchi.Everything is well priced and decently sized. Despite the kimchi fries, I'm a fan. If this place were closer to where we lived, I'd frequent it more often."
"This review is painful for me to write because I wanted to just love & adore Del Seoul but it just didn't live up to the hype. The place itself is a fun place, plays good music, excellent service. Liked the atmosphere.The food however is hit or miss. The Kalbi taco was amazing! How can it not be though, it's kalbi!? Skip the Kimchi Fries. Honestly, the pork belly is next to none and the fries just weren't that good. Disappointing for $7. Pass. The Seoul Street Dumplings were good and just $6 for 8! They were honestly extremely good. Finally I had the chicken taco. It wasn't good at all. Bland and dry. Now I notice they have taken it off their menu since they reopened a couple weeks ago. A very smart choice as it wasn't good. =/The prices are just right so if you stick to the kalbi tacos and maybe some dumplings, you're going to LOVE Del Seoul. I'll definitely be back, order just a kalbi taco & dumplings (I'm lying, I want to try their new fish taco, too) and I have a feeling the review will be bumped up to 5 stars. Here's hoping!"
"Best fish tacos ever! And Shrimp tacos! Can't get enough of them! Everything else is delicious also- the veggie bi bim bop, the kimchi fries and the sandwiches are tasty. Turns out we come here whenever we have Korean cravings!Will return for dumplings!!"
"I came here twice on my last visit to Chi and was pleased with the food, service and prices. The atmosphere was relaxed, as I prefer it, and most of the food was very delicious.I gave them three stars instead of four for one reason: kimchi. There kimchi is terrible! Very bland, too much vinegar/fish sauce... I'm not sure what exactly is wrong with it but since this is a staple of a great Korean dining experience I was a bit perturbed. If you've never had kimchi don't make their's your first but don't let that turn you away from this spot, everything else I tried was great!"
"Four and a HALF stars.I have a confession to make. I don't like asian fusion. I want my asian food to be authentic, tasty, and cheap. I've spent a lot of time in Taiwan (not THAILAND. Taiwan), I have this thing where I won't pay for shi-shi asian food just for ambiance and reputation. Seems to me, most asian fusion spots are just... expensive, small portions, and too much hype.But then I moved to Chicago. And I read the reviews for Del Seoul. They had the magic words... ""FRENCH FRIES.""I went with a good friend, so we could share a bunch of dishes. 1) Dolsat bibimbap: not the best i've had. The flavors and ingredients were great, but they overcooked the egg. and that's half the joy of a bibimbap. The silkiness of the runny yolk is half, and the crispy rice on the bottom is the other. Sadly, the overcooked egg made this dish disappointing for me. 3 stars.2) Korean street pork dumplings. DELICIOUS. These taste like most authentic pork and veggie steamed dumplings I've had in Taiwan. Sharing an order is a great idea if you want an appetizer, but I'd love to eat a whole order myself.3) Kimchi French Fries. OMFG. Crispy, seasoned fries. A bit of kimchi that's not super sour, but just gives the dish that bit o tartness. Melty cheese. a few pieces of pork belly. Some scallions and a drizzle of ranch dressing to top it off. I'd come back just for these.SIX STARS.Plus, if you manage to not pig out here, you can head down to Molly's Cupcakes and grab dessert!!I'll be back to try the tacos!"
"As if they need another awesome review. I love this place. I have two fall back foods: Shrimp tacos with hot crunchy shrimp and lots of cool crunchy slaw. Hot stone bowl bibimbop. It comes out too hot to even eat. There is a nice variety of veggies, and the best part is the chewy rice on the bottom of the bowl. When its crowded they have an ingenious way of guaranteeing tables. They have numbers on all the tables. After you order your food they assign you a table. It keeps people from grabbing a table as soon as they walk in. I wish more places would do that."
"Their food is very good and I love how you get quality food quickly without all of the glitzy restaurant service. Sometimes I don't feel like waiting around for my food! I had to laugh when this KOREAN place called their sandwiches ""BANH MI"" which are VIETNAMESE words! Their sandwiches aren't Vietnamese at all. Why not just say Korean sandwiches? Their fries are nothing great... They should spice up their sides. They are a little bland... needs more salt and pepper or something other than just siracha. Also, their menu is so small... I wasn't the only one out of my group of 6 people to complain about that. It felt like my eyes started to hurt."
"MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM­MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM­MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM­MMMMe likey. Huge amount of food for cheap. The tacos were GREAT. Got a free cripsy chicken wing - nom. Good soup. Add siracha to steamed dumplings. Good everything. Casual spot. No booze... just a food fest. MMM thinking about it makes me want it now. Not your usual sit down restaurant. Order your food, get your number, and it will get delivered to your table in a few minutes. Okay... you have to go now... I am."
"As close as you can get to California style korean/mexican fusion street food.  Awesome clever Korean Tacos, and amazing chicken wings."
Shrimp sandwich is spec-fucking-tacular. I won't even try anything else on the menu.
"Del Seoul does not need more reviews.I am a regular. Try to be careful during rush hours - the food tend to be subpar to what you are served during off peak hours. The offpeak fish taco has more mayo more evenly spread. Same with the bulgogi - offpeak ones are more flavorful.But nonetheless, always awesome and value for money."
LOOOVE the kalbi rib and tempura fish taco! Very yummy and reasonable priced! Looking for parking is a challenge in that area
"After walking past this place for literally years, my fiancee and I decided to make the plunge. Wow, I really wish we would have tried this place years before because my God the food was great!!! We got the Shrimp Tacos and the Kalbi Poutine.The shrimp tacos were amazing! They each have 2 pieces of fried shrimp, but the shrimp are a nice size and they both take up the entire taco when they are side by side. The sauce on the tacos is also amazing. It really ties the whole thing together.The Poutine fries were great too. The pulled pork on them melted in your mouth and the sauce, once again, was great!! I highly recommend trying both of these dishes when you come here.The meal was so good that we literally came back for dinner the same night. Only this time we tried the Steamed Dumplings instead of the Poutine. The dumplings were good, but I would got with the Poutine again next time since that was exceptional!"
"I live nearby and am a regular at Del Seoul.  I can't get enough of the chili shrimp tacos. I've tried the kimchi fries a few times and they are also absolutely delicious. Tacos are a bit pricey for what I've seen other places but I can't get enough of them.  I've tried each taco and I don't think any of them are extra special, apart from the shrimp tacos.  Del Seoul is a great place to stop for lunch/dinner for carry out or dine in when I don't feel like cooking myself."
"The spicy shrimp sandwich is AMAZING! Staff varies from night to night, but u dont go there for the staff."
"Tacos should be left the the Hispanic / Mexican community.Del Seoul's meat was chewy, not edible, their ""hundred year old recipe"" for dumplings was crap. The dumplings had no taste and the covering was like eating rubber.Their Jasmine tea had 0 jasmine flavor.Definitely not recommended. HORRIBLE food."
"Korean tacos, get me in line, now. I recommend the Sambal Fish taco (Tempura fish, picked red onions, napa slaw and sambal aioli. A collection of flavors that come together and explode in your mouth. Amazing. I also recommend the kalbi tacos. I definitely want to try the kalbi poutine next time I am in the area. This place is not BYOB or serves beer, but Korean tacos are an absolute must."
"Yummy! We had the kimchi, and ofcourse brought some home, it was delicious, spicy and tangy at the right amounts. We also got the bibimbop, and I can say with certainty that you will not leave this place hungry. Their portion sizes are big and food is delicious!"
"Awesome food! The hot stones and tacos are awesome and great comfort food. Highly recommend this place. Only pitfall- service can be variable every time I go. Sometimes it great and other times terrible for example 2-3 months ago the cashier was extremely rude and did not know much about the items on the menu when asked. She ruined our appetite that night because she was so incredibly rude, but the food made up for it overall."
Kimchi fries. Shrimp taco. Fish taco.Oh my goodness. This place makes me want to live in the apartment right in front because i want to eat Del Seoul all day. Tacos are delicious and consistent every time. The staff? Courteous.  Delicious!
Love love love this place. We tried all of the tacos and they were all delicious. The loaded fries are yummy also. Can't wait to go back and try the poutine.
"Was introduced to this place by a good friend who lived in Chicago for a few hers now. I didn't know this kind of fusion business had quietly carried itself across the country but it sure is awesome.Del Seoul, as you may have guessed, is a prime spot for some fusion between Korean food and Mexican food in the form of a taco. They serve so many different varieties of interesting and delicious sounding tacos as well as a few very strange and gross sounding ones. The tacos, however, are great. They are truly tasty and very innovative. Much more so than a lot of the CA ""Korean tacos"" places that you find in food trucks etc. They put more care and better ingredients into the tacos to make it truly a creative choice and not just a bunch of meat in a tortilla kind of thing. Highly recommended!"
I love this place the food is beyond amazing. My mouth is watering just writing this review!!!!  the shrimp tacos are to die for.....
"The Korean tacos here are very good, filling, and cheap. Even my LA friends admit that these are on the same level as they have at home. All the flavors are good, recommend you go with a few friends so you can try different things. I go hear semi-frequently because it's easy for me to get to."
"Chicago is finally catching up to LA's Korean taco craze... about time!Tacos:Kalbi(Grilled Short Rib) - Absolutely delicious, great flavor, exactly what I wanted from a short rib tacoSpicy BBQ Pork-Tons of flavor, I'm a fanSpicy BBQ Chicken-Wow, now this one is where it's at... tender, yummy chicken... get in my belly!Sesame-Chili Shrimp-Didn't know what to expect going into this when I ordered it... was thinking it was going to be like a traditional shrimp taco, but I was wrong. It's a battered, deep fried shrimp and holy crap was it good. So the tough part is deciding what my favorite taco was... I can't say I didn't like any of the tacos. Don't make me pick just one taco as a favorite... cause I can't. Gun to my head... I still couldn't do it. I'll give you my top two though, Sesame-Chili Shrimp & Spicy Chicken. Also got the Kimchi & Pork Belly Fries... maybe it was hyped up too much for me, but I didn't think anything too special of it.My coke was pretty solid. Nice and cold. This is definitely not La Pasadita... so if you're looking for those kind of tacos move on. Glad to finally have some Korean BBQ tacos in Chicago and this place definitely gets it right, Del Seoul is happiness in my tummy. My #FatKidSunday was complete with Del Seoul."
"Hmmm Korean tacos. Wait what are Korean tacos? Difference? To me it's about the flavoring of the meat.Miso soup - thumbs down, leave it to the Japs to perfect thisKalbi taco/Chicken taco - hmmMmmm the meat are so tasty and flavorful .. the meat makes these tacos worthwhile because the only thing else that's served on them is lettuceKimchi fries - I'm a big kimchi fan and have been dying to try this since I've heard about it! There was suppose to be pork belly in this? What pork belly? Verdict = decent, not amazing. Hot Stone Bibimbop - I asked does the hot stone really make a difference? and cashier stands by the fact that it does because it makes the rice crunchy/crispy. So we went with the hot stone and it sure did make the rice crispy, good portion."
This place is awesome. Kimchi fries are delicious and you can't go wrong with the chicken tacos.
"I try to visit a place twice before I act like I know enough to review it.  The first visit was so awesome that I dragged the boy back with me not even a week later for seconds.  Review time.The gamja fries (extra side of sauce), shrimp tacos, and fish tacos are absolutely worth any line there might be when you arrive so keep your eye on the prize.  Service is speedy and the store in general is clean and inviting if you choose to eat in.  My second visit, we carried out, snagged a couple tall-boy Saporros, and made a lakefront picnic out of it.  The food carried surprisingly well.Next visit calls for kimchi fries and/or poutine as well as the dumplings."
"I can totally see going to Del Seoul a lot if I lived near by.  As a destination place, meh, probably wouldn't go out of my way again.  The taco labeled ""The Best"" is literally the best, at least based on the ones my friend and I ordered.  Everything other than the ""best"" shrimp one is basically the same taco with different meats.  Kind of boring.  The fries with garlic aioli were potently garlicy, in a very good way, but I didn't feel like I could go 4 stars based on garlic aioli, which is pretty pervasive these days.  If I was in the 'hood and happened to stumble back in, I'd definitely try the more amped up fry concoctions such as the poutine."
"Being a fan of Korean, Mexican, and Korean-Mexican food, I had to try this.  Considering I had a number of my friends raving about it, I decided to come here one night.  Perhaps I came the wrong night, but nothing here stood out to me.  Yeah, the inside was cool and clean, they get points for that, however I found the food fell short.  I had every type of taco, and every single taco tasted like corn tortilla. I like corn tortillas as much as the next guy, but I'd like to taste a little more than just the tortilla.I'm hoping this was just a ""bad night"" kind of thing. I'll be back and hoping things will be better :)"
"I'm sure I'll come up with a Korean ""fusion"" joke shortly after I say you should dive in here and grab the taco(s) of your choice.Short rib, chicken, and pork tacos are always...how you say...uh, Kim Jong YUM. (Sorry. Still working on the fusion joke.)"
Boy was I disappointed. I was so looking forward to coming back to town to have their kimchi fries and what a disappointment.  I had these fries maybe 2 yrs ago and it was so good but this time i noticed a definite change. Hardly any pork and the kimchi didn't seem like kimchi.  Was it lettuce??I also got the shrimp and Kalbi tacos and those didn't disappoint.  Each taco came with plenty of meat and nicely seasoned salad on top.  I won't come back for the kimchi fries but maybe will come back for the tacos.
Best tacos ever! The Korean/Mexican flavor combinations are so delicious and unlike any other taco I've had. My favorite is the shrimp taco followed by the sambal. The bimbimbop is also great. I can't recommend this place enough.
"Clever name.I had the Bulgogi plate and my girlfriend had the shrimp tacos and her and I also split a plate of kimchi fries. I'll rate them all one by one.Bulgogi Plate:I was really hungry the night I ate there so that might have an effect on my review. If you don't know, Bulgogi is a type of beef marinated to deliciousness served with kimchi, rice, and bak choy. I love Korean BBQ, especially Bulgogi, so with that said I immediately had something to compare with. This place was good, it wasnt the  best but it was good. It satisfied my hunger and it was definitely a good serving size. I would eat it again because it was definitely tasty. Shrimp Tacos/kalbi tacos:I only had a single bite of her shrimp tacos, but my initial thought upon tasting that bite was ""wow, that's really good!"" Everybody seems to recommend the shrimp tacos so they must be pretty delicious, not just to me. Kimchi Fries:This was totally brand new to me. But man oh man, in glad I tried them. They are delicious. They are exactly what you think they are, French fries with kimchi on it. It's a perfect snack and the portion size isn't small. It's a good size for two people to share and be satisfied with. I Ioved them a lot.All in all, the place was good. Busy as any good restaurant should be. There is only street parking so be aware of that and come hungry. I'd definitely come back to Del Seoul again."
"It has a great vibe, perky and helpful service and the concept is refreshing. But I ordered a bento box and thought the meat was chewy. Lot of flavor. I would go back but have other dishes. A bit pricey for what you get too."
"AWESOME!!! the shrimp tacos lived up to the hype. i also enjoyed the short ribs one--the chickens left something to be desired.in addition, the gamja fries were the perfect mix of crispy and soft and not too garlicy but oh so garlic-y delicous. I tried my dates bibmbop which was outstanding. This place is relatively inexpensive and full of flavor. I have never had Korean BBQ until now and this was an incredible first place to try!"
"3.5 starsThe tacos are solid -- got the kalbi taco and the shrimp taco.  The kalbi taco was stuffed with well-seasoned kalbi meat, cabbage, and lettuce with a little bit of kim-chi sauce.  The shrimp taco was good, but I would prefer having more shrimp and/or larger shrimp in the tacos.  The small shrimp didn't allow for me to really taste much of the shrimp, as it was overwhelmed by the sauces and vegetables in the taco.The kimchi fries here were disappointing - the cheese looks like it was cold, and there didn't seem to be much ""pork belly"" in it.  Not good.  Dumplings were okay - nothing to rave about.  The bahn mi was good, as it was stuffed with a ton of meat."
"Ugh.. i should really listen to my bf more often.  Wait.. WHAT did I just say?!  How bout lets just say Score one for him.  ;-)  This.  Place.  Is.  YUM!Finally came here on a Sunday night w the bf.  He was hungry, I wasnt but I said I'd tag along.  We're waiting in line and he asked if I wanted anything.  Im looking at the menu and thinking.. ummmm... idk what the heck is IN these so called ""tacos"".  So i say no.  But then i look at their soda machine and see they have Coke Zero!!  Ooh i want! I want!  Sorry.. i have a thing with Coke Zero and not many establishments have it.  Anyway, he ordered a chicken taco, 2 beef and an order of fries.  He asks if i want a taste.. I make a face but decide to say yes.  Whoa!  Umm.  What just happened?  This is.. yummy???  I continue sipping on my soda and then I ask for another nibble.  Hmm.. this IS good.  You see, I don't like pickled anything and I'm a very picky eater but these tacos.. speak to everything i DO love in food.  Spicy (he added Sriracha sauce), sweet, savory all wrapped up in ... a TORTILLA!  FUX YESSSS!!  Only thing missing for me to marry that taco is some fresh lime juice and a side of Macallan.  Hey, Im Mexican what can i say i love limes and i love tortillas. :-)Two days later I want tacos for dinner and I decide on Korean Tacos.  I come here w mom and the bf.  I start making suggetions for my mom and she starts making faces and saying she doesnt want to try anything let alone with bbq.  Hmm.. Now I see where I get it from.  Wait.. am I turning into my mom?!  ahhhh!!  That's another forum not yelp.  I ordered chicken n beef tacos, the boy gets tacos too and mom picked the Ribeye Plate (Bulgogi) and we all shared the fries.  She loved loved her food.  Then they bring out the kimchi (which is the #1 reason why I had never been here bc i dont like pickled anything)  Again.. she LOVED it.  I tried the ribeye.. very flavorful.  And nice and HOT!  I love my food piping hot. She kept raving about this place on the ride home.. already picking out what she was going to eat on her trip here.  As for me, I came back AGAIN two days later.  3x times in one week!  Bottom Line:  Thumbs up!  Sweet.  Salty.  Spicy.  And the price point is good too.  Just wish it was closer to my house."
"In the past years, Mexican-Korean mashup restaurants have become all the rage. They are quite popular in Atlanta and I am now seeing the same trend in Chicago. I for one, am on-board with this craziness. This tasty tasty mashup craziness.If you are a financially conscious individual like me (read:cheapo. Yeah i'm not ashamed), then you'll most likely want to get the best bang for your buck on food. The tacos are delicious, but they are $3.50 each and you will likely need 3-4 to make it into a complete meal. The sandwiches are Banh-Mis (Viet, not Korean) and they are decently sized and super fresh and tasty. The best value -by far- here is the BBB. At $9, its filled with rice, mushrooms, meat, tons of veggies, egg and flavor to last you a lifetime. Make sure you get the stone-heated one vs the regular, as the hot stone will cook the rice at the bottom and make it crispy/crunchy. Make sure you add all the sauce that comes with it and don't be shy on the cock sauce (yeah that's what she said). Mix it all up and enjoy the heartiest meal of your life. You won't want another meal for the rest of the day, but you'll definitely want a nap later. Or two."
The spicy shrimp tacos are amazing! I never would have thought to go in this place due to the storefront being very nondescript but I am so glad I did. The food is constantly good and reasonably priced. A great alternative to fast food!
From Seattle originally and loved the kimchi fries.  takes an american classic seasoned cheese fries and throws some spicy veggies ontop.  Had a chicken taco and was impressed as well.  give it a try and I would try the dumplings next time.  also corn tortilla's...I like flour but it is what it is...Service was great as well
"Dinner box of spicy bbq pork is amusing. Came to Chicago for the first time, and the spicy pork is really impressive"
"We tried the kimchi fries, dumplings, sesame-chili shrimp tacos, kalbi tacos, and spicy pork tacos and EVERYTHING was delicious. They do a great job of blending Korean cuisine with a variety of other regional dishes. I really appreciated their attention to detail such as mincing the kimchee so that we didn't have to eat huge chunks of kimchee with our fries. Everything just accompanied each other really well and the flavors were memorable.I'm a big fan of fusion done well enough to be considered beyond a gimick.  Just because the general public rants and raves over a place will guarantee more scrutiny from me and this place passed the test. Prices are not cheap by any means but if you order carefully in smaller portions for lunch then you'll walk away with a quality meal in your tummy without your wallet feeling too light.Good luck finding parking in this neighborhood during peak hours, though. We had to park almost a half mile away so thank goodness it was worth the trouble."
"Stopped in for lunch on a weekday, it was quite busy and I see why.  I went with shrimp taco, kalbi taco and kimchi fries which were all good, i'd probably order the same thing again, maybe even two of the shrimp tacos, it was wonderful.  Not the cheapest meal in the world, came to ~$16 with a soda, but well worth an occasional splurge."
"Finally got to try the place:  Korean taco's are delicious and it's in the slaw. And Del Seoul makes pretty decent slaw.Like everyone said. The Sesame-Chili Shrimp taco is the best - who doesn't like deep-fried shrimp rolled in mayo (my bad, 'sesame-chili aioli')?The Kalbi is actually pretty lackluster - dry and permeated with kalbi sauce. Though, my biggest complain for Del Seoul: If Kogi can sell their tacos for $2, are your tacos really worth $3-4?"
"Have been back to this place a few times after celebrating my birthday here last year. Really like the concept of Korean tacos. I like how they pile lots of veggies on the tacos, balancing out the beautifully flavored meats underneath. My favorite by far is the shrimp, always ordered at least one of it whenever I come here. The Kimchi fries are cool to try as a novelty item, but too much of a guilty pleasure! Place gets crowded at peak dining hours, but totally worth the wait in my opinion. But don't all go at the same time. I don't want to wait THAT long for my food."
"Have always wanted to try this place so finally stopped in for a Korean bite to eat! Hubby had a Bahn Mi that he thought was just ok, tasted good but didn't think it was worth the price.However, the Bebimbop was delicious, full of flavor and a great size portion, we both agreed we will definitely back for more of that!All in all, a bit expensive but the service and food are great!"
"I have heard a lot of Del Seoul through friends and their friends... they always told me to stop by and have the best Korean Taco and their Kimchi Fries were to die for... now, I typically don't buy all the hypes for lot of reasons... I'm one of those people that would rather experience it for myself and judge it on my own terms... thus all the hypes, I took with grain of salt and ignore... I mean, I live 4 hours away, it's not like I can get in my car and drive over, eat and come back home.... Well, the day finally came, went to Chicago with friends and had my list of places to hit and I was determined to hit them all.Our second stop of Del Seoul... I got the Kalbi Taco, Shrimp Taco, Shrimp Banh Mi and shared a kimchee fries.Kimchi Fries - this was the last item to arrive at our table, thus gets the first review.  When we got the kimchi fries, the fries were luke warm, the cheese had hardened and hard to eat.  As for taste, i don't know if it's the fries, but the whole kimchi fries didn't blend well.Kalbi Taco - the meat was excellent, well seasoned and soft, the lettuce salad they put on there was little bit bland, but the seasoning of the kalbi made up for it... the lettuce salad they put on was made with fish sauce, chili powder, garlic, sugar, sesame oil and salt, a standard Korean salad that is also found at many AYCE bbq's.  Shrimp Taco - the shrimp was perfectly cooked and excellent.Shrimp Banh Mi - the bread was too thick, but overall the taste was excellent.They have expanded from their original place and looks like they are now offering other Korean dishes... I would recommend that you stuck with the taco's if you are visiting... next time I go, I'll have to try their spicy pork taco... of course, I can't pass up on the shrimp taco :)If you are passing by or visiting Chicago, stop by.  Parking can be little hectic, but when you find an open spot, park there and walk if possible... little exercise before and after eating won't kill you :)"
WE LOVE this place!  We frequently stop for the chicken taco and kim chi fries!!!!
One of my favorite spots in Chicago. Good way to satisfy a craving for tacos and/or asian. Nothing real special about the space but the food is excellent. Better for a casual lunch than dinner. Recommendations: -Shrimp tacos-Short rib tacos-Kimchi fries
"I've been visiting many places all over Chicago-land (and beyond actually), but I'm going to use the lame excuse of being busy with work as to why I have not been able to yelp about more places more recently.The problem with doing this is that the longer you go without eating at a certain locale, the harder it becomes to remember what the food was like. On top of that, you lose sight of minute details that may or may not bump a restaurant from a 3 to a 4 or a 4 to a 5.Why am I saying all of this?I almost rated Del Seoul to be a 3 because I didn't remember anything about this place except for their kimchi fries (which are superb by the way). However, on my recent return here, I remembered what made me come back in the first place: the shrimp tacos. The perfect blend of mostly sweet and a dab of spice makes the shrimp tacos quite delectable. The other tacos aren't bad but nothing holds a light to the shrimp. The only complaint I would have with the tacos is that they put WAY too much of their ""secret"" salad/slaw onto it, which looks to really just be some lettuce mixed in an asian-style vinaigrette. But once again, this is but a small complaint to the awesomeness that is the shrimp taco.Other than the price being slightly too high (you can easily spend 15 bucks if you're hungry), everything else about the restaurant is spectacular. They even have Sriracha available to be used in whatever quantities you wish to burn your insides.Also, the kimchi fries were just as delectable as I remember. They could use slightly more pork belly but they cook the kimchi perfectly and don't skimp out on portion size.Recommendation: 2 shrimp tacos and an order of kimchi fries"
Every taco is delicious. This place is unique and incredibly flavorful. The tacos are expensive compared to taco truck tacos but as a lunch meal it's not pricey at all. It is so damn tasty I will never get tired of their food.
"Yummy tacos in my tummy.The food at Del Seoul is tasty and cheap. I highly recommend the tacos. I've tried the fish, shrimp and chicken, all of which are excellent. Chicken was the best, hands down. My friend got the veggie bibimbop, which she said was tasty, but it had beef on top. Whoopsies. Good thing she's not a vegetarian. At peak hours, it takes a while to get your food and the restaurant itself can be loud and crowded, so I would recommend ordering ahead and picking up to eat at home."
"This place was delicious! I especially recommend the kalbi poutine. The meat was tender and was a bit sweet, and you can never go wrong with poutine! The spicy BBQ pork bento box was also delicious and not a bad deal. It came with a salad and some rice. The spicy tofu hotpot had delicious silky, soft tofu. The best part was all the seafood in the hotpot; they are very generous with this!We also got the street dumplings, which were so-so. I wouldn't come here for the street dumplings. I thought the tacos were ok, but that may be because I shared them with too many people and wasn't able to get a large bite. It was the first thing I ate there and I thought it was delicious, but the meal only got better with the poutine and hotpot. :DI would definitely come back to this place when I come back to Chicago. It is also in a great location, with lots of other restaurants nearby."
"Shut the front door this place is so good and it smells so good, if you let that smell out there's going to be a line out of the door! I literally walked in here because of the smell. I walked out with 3 tacos, two for my fiance and I to share and one for our family to taste. My family member literally tasted it and said ""damn it, Emy"" and let her daughter try and the daughter said ""oh man, mom that is so good"". They proceeded to demand that I show them where I got this taco from and now only did we order more food, but they ordered $25 worth of food to take home based on ONE bite of my taco. It's that serious. Don't let the line intimate you, it goes by really quickly!!"
Two words: Kalbi Poutine.  Get this magical dish and thank me later.
Korean taco orgy.
"My friend calls them stoner fries. Kimchi, onion, pork belly, scallions, cheese, and sour cream. I couldn't think of a more lovely combination.Everything else they serve is pretty great and the service is swell too!... But go for the stoner fries!"
"I never would have gone here on my own, so I'm grateful that a friend made me. The tacos and french fries are so good. I would drive across the city for them!"
"Awesome Korean tacos, especially the fish taco, which in my opinion gives you the most for your money. The kalbi tacos and the shrimp tacos are also very good here too. The stone bowls are pretty standard and didn't really stand out as much as the tacos. The wings do not compare to Crisp's wings and I would not recommend them if you have time to go to Crisp."
"balls.  i can't even believe i haven't reviewed this place yet.i've been here pah-lenty of times, so obvi, i love their tacos.  kalbi and spicy bbq pork tacos are where it's at, although the shrimp tacos are pretty damn good, too. i order san cilantro, of course.  the french fries were just deece, nothing spesh.  since i feel like they have great tacos, i haven't veered too far away from them, so i should try the bahn mi (viet?) and all the stuff under ""For Sharing.""  since sharing is caring.  except when i eat it all.you walk up to the counter, pay the nice asian girl, and then take a tall table number and find your seat.  they have FREE SODA water. i'm a total sucker for that.  lots of asians come here, that's a good sign."
"FIVE STARS!! This place was amazing! Tried a variety of the korean tacos and they were all delicious. The bibimbap in stone bowl was good. Egg fried perfectly. Love the crunch of the rice mixed with the fresh vegtables and spicy sauce.  Kimchi fries were not bad but not the highlight of the meal. Wings were also good, but very sweet. Overall I'd say you cant go wrong with whatever you order but next time I go Ill likely be sticking with the scrumptious tacos! :)"
This is a nice and quick place to get some tasty Korean food. The Bento Boxes are huge. The steam dumplings are average. The poutine fries are amazing and the fish tacos didn't disappoint. It's not really a sit down place. You must order at the counter but the staff is friendly and that food is affordable.
"I thought this place was pretty good. I had the BBQ chicken taco which was very delicious, I also had the hot stone bibimbop which was very tasty. We ordered the poutine which I did not care for - I have had better. Overall the value for the meal was great and I would eat here again."
"I've only had a couple of things off the Del Seoul menu in the 2 times I've been there, but it's probably pretty representative. The menu has a variety of Korean foods, some Korean fusion, and they're pretty good. I've had the kalbi tacos, the hot stone bowl bibimbap, and the kimchi fries. My roommate swears by the kalbi tacos, but they're sort of overpriced for what they are and the tortillas aren't very good. The kalbi itself is very good though (don't get me wrong). I enjoyed the stone bowl bibimbap's sizzle and crunchy rice bits, but it's pretty standard. I think my favorite thing is the kimchi fries, with the little bits of pork thrown in. Yuuum-o. Is it even possible to go wrong with kimchi + fried potatoes? It helps that the fries themselves are pretty decent too.On the whole, I like Del Seoul (at least enough to have come more than once), but it's sort of just pretty good and not mind-blowing. I've had a lot of people rave about it to me, but I think a lot of the appeal is in the novelty of another fusion food place."
The shrimp and fish and short rib tacos packed a lot of Korean flavor.  And near Trader Joe's.
"A great place for one of my first dining experiences in Chicago.While this place is known for their tacos (I agree with other Yelpers - the shrimp one is the best), I found the other menu items to be more satisfying. The banh mi sandwiches are large and satisfying, and I think might actually be a better bang for your buck than the tacos. We ordered the spicy pork banh mi and I really enjoyed the cilantro, radish slaw, and jalapenos that accompanied the sandwich. For $6.25, you get a lot of food.The spicy tofu hotpot (soondubu jiggae) was my favorite thing. A steaming bowl of perfectly seasoned soup with soft tofu and a generous serving of various seafood. It is not as spicy as I usually like it but quite delicious.Overall, a great experience."
"Very good.  My wife and I had the fish, shrimp and BBQ chicken tacos.  They were all bursting with flavor and our favorite was the chicken.  We really wanted to try the kimchi fries, but the kimchi is pre-mixed with pork belly and we don't eat beef or pork.  So, we got plain fries that came with a tasty garlic-sesame aioli sauce.The only downside is the portions are small.  Overall however, this was a very good snack with very good/friendly service and clean restrooms."
Everything is fried. No original flavor. Not reasonably priced at all. Mediocre service. Yuck.
"One of our favorite places when we visit Chicago- great food and great staff. We have little ones,and the staff always come by to chat with them- makes for a much more enjoyable meal all around!"
"I ordered the shrimp,kalbi and pork tacos.I simply loved the pork and kalbi tacos.Awesome taste though I thought the shrimp taco was a little too sweet for my taste and the amount of sauce was a little too much.Overall great stuff."
"(I give five stars whenever I see a WOW factor... btw this wow factor can be very subjective...)I gave them five stars based on two dishes I really loved at Del Seoul.  It is a small Korean fast food joint in Lincoln Park, where you order the food at the counter and then they serve the food when ready.  The dish I really liked were marinated beef taco (either bulgogi or galbi... I don't remember) and kimchi pork belly fries.  The first one had the traditional taco with definite Korean touch, which worked pretty well by the way.  As for the fries, I was genuinely surprised that the fries and kimchi could work pretty well (I knew kimchi and pork belly work pretty well, but didn't imagine this combination).  It was very filling and tasty.Relatively their chicken taco and bahn mi weren't that spectacular, but I think they deserve my 5 stars because of the first two dishes.  btw, the service was good, too (I just don't think service is that important unless it's a fancy dine-in place OR unless the service was one of the worst)."
"Korean?  Tacos?  Korean tacos.  Genius!  I was definitely impressed by this place, service is fast, the food is delicious and it's reasonably priced considering the large portions.Here's the breakdown in order of deliciousness.  Note, the tacos are packed with meat (with the exception of the two puny shrimp, which I didn't try).  Basically, there was nothing I didn't like, so this list goes from amazing to really great.-kalbi short rib taco - SHUT. THE. FRONT. DOOR.  Pure ecstasy.-spicy pork taco - well seasoned, just generally delicious-fish taco - it's a piping hot piece of tempura haddock with a tangy sauce and pickled onions. Yum. -bulgogi banh mi - lots of beef, pickled condiments and the freshest, most delicious bread ever.-kimchi fries - ok, the fries are their own are delicious, but pile on pork belly, kimchi and loads of cheese and these are fantastic.I can't believe I've never been here before.  It will not be long before I return."
"OK I've been here twice in one week, and BOTH times the service was ATROCCCCIOUS. I can let a restaurant get away with amazing-redunkulous food with neutral service, but POOR service does not deserve more than 2 stars. Not gonna knock their tacos, because both of my friends enjoyed theirs (chili shrimp, kalbi, and bbq pork). And for less than $3 per taco, not bad. Their kim chi fries were NOT anything remarkable...honestly I could buy fries elsewhere and throw my own kim chi on there. I did like the decor of the place (a multi-reflection mirror by the bathrooms, some cool collage art on the walls), but again the rude service is a HELLLL NO! The employee literally rolled her eyes at my friend and I when we were asking for recommendations! Del Seoul...your service just doesn't have enough soul!"
Really good quick Asian-fusion. Delicious tacos. Check it out!
"Stopped by today with a coworker for lunch - wow! I had a fish taco (the piece of fish was HUGE! Awesome!) and two of the shrimp tacos (OMG) and all were delicious. Food was filling, warm, flavorful and so reasonably priced!My coworker had a bibimbap and couldn't eat it all - so much food! We also shared the garlic french fries, which were delicious.I will absolutely be back - service was friendly and quick, price was right, and food is delicious! Great lunch!"
"I feel like almost every restaurant I've fell in love with in Chicago in the last year has had some sort of Korean influence or been an outright Korean restaurant.Del Seoul is the epitome of this, rivaled only by La Tacorea on Belmont, where Mexican flavors and Korean flavors dance together in new and gutsy ways.Highlights at Del Seoul for me were the shrimp tacos and the Kimchi Fries.  I am usually not a big fan of seafood on the taco.  I am almost entirely a go-pork-or-go-home taco eater, but the shrimp at Del Seoul is something I crave--I long for it--and I will stop at nothing to reach my goal of getting it when the craving appears.  Del Seoul tacos were my last meal--i.e. last solid food for two weeks--before having all four of my wisdom teeth removed.  This is serious.The kimchi fries are a giant messy clod of kimchi and pork belly and cheese and all kinds of other delicious things, all smooshed together over hot, crispy fries.  Best when eaten with fork.  You will not regret the purchase, but it's a lot.  The menu says ""for sharing"", and that's legit.  You do not want to tackle these fries on your own.Del Seoul has real Korean food, but if you want real Korean food, go to a real Korean restaurant.  If you want Mexi-korean, get it here. (I get that fries are not Mexican, but if you go to get tacos, you might as well get the fries, gosh.)"
"Yum! Got the Korean Ribeye Steak (Bulgogi) Bahn Mi. The meat was very flavorful and tender, and the veggies were crisp and refreshing. It could be a case by case thing, but I felt like the bread was a little too hard/dry so it made the sandwich kind of tough to eat. Overall, it's a great place to get some inexpensive and delicious grub. Will be back again!"
"This place is very different and offers some tasty options if you've never had Korean.  The transitional American-Korean influence is there to show you Korean food isn't that bad.  The prices are fair, and the portions are small.  It's a takeout place primarily, but not a bad place to pause a late night stroll."
"My friend raved about this place.  Unfortunately, I rarely get down to this side of town. However, I happened to be shopping a BBB and realized this place is literally a few blocks away.  So, I decided to give it a try.I ordered a fish taco, a shrimp taco, and two bbq chicken tacos.  (No, I wasn't being a piglet either).  I shared the tacos with another person, lol).  The fish and shrimp taco were delicious. The bbq chicken were just ok.  I believe the menu said them to be spicy but they weren't.  My friend said I should have ordered the fries.  Next time though (fries are a weakness). I would go back.  The service was fast, easy, and very kind. Parking was a cinch as well. I was in and out in 15 minutes.I did see the sandwiches and they looked great.. Next time, I will get fries and a sandwich.  (or... maybe even a hot stone)..."
"like it, love it, live with it!The shrimp tacos are highly recommended, the kimchi Fries is interesting and don't forget the Bulgogi Sandwich.Prices are really reasonable, consider it's in a very good location.No Ambiance, casual hangout with friends rather than expecting romantic dinner.delivery meal will be good especially in this cold winter Brrr!oh! the Bi Bim Bap is yummy!"
"Holy S***!Can't believe I over looked this place, saw almost 600 yelp reviews and had to come in!Shrimp tacos, DO IT!!  Amazing.....Pot stickers, yum... Kimchi porkbelly fires, double yum!"
"I've had some Korean/Mexican fusion places, but this was definitely a place at the top of my list.  All the tacos were solid -- kalbi, pork, and shrimp.  There wasn't too much of a Mexican flavor other than the tortillas, but they were really good and great to try as tacos.  I also got the kimchi pork belly fries.  Anytime that you add kimchi and pork belly to things, you know it's going to be a delicious party in your mouth.  YUM.The plates were a bit less good than the rest of the food.  Perhaps because that's more ""traditional"" Korean, and this place isn't known as much for that, but I would definitely recommend the tacos and fries over the plates.If you're in the Chicago area, give Del Seoul a try!!"
If you go there make sure to try the DUMPLINGS!! this place is sooo good I love it! I WILL be coming back XD
"Every time I'm in the area I say that I will try something new, but then I end up here instead. I am a fan of their shrimp tacos and shrimp banh mi. Their kalbi tacos are good, but the shrimp is still my favorite. The kimchi fries are also a good choice. They keep raising their price every time I come here though. :/"
OMG!!!!! Why can't I have a Del Seoul in Virginia!!! I would literally drive hours to eat here again!!! The food was amazing and unlike anything I've ever seen!
"This is a great spot and I am glad to have it so close by - some of the best korean tacos and dishes I have had since regularly visiting food trucks in San Francisco.Always seems to be pretty busy, but have not had too much trouble getting a table.  We have ordered take out a few times, which helps with the wait for food to arrive, but getting a plate to go in a plastic container is no where close to how good they are eating in - on the cast iron plates that make the rice brown and chewy on the bottom.  Value of this food is fantastic as well, never left hungry, though that could be the rice...either way, great for the weekly rotation."
"The poutine is AMAZING.I always get the shrimp and beef tacos. Not impressed with the fish taco- reminds me of a fish stick. Quick, and good. I crave this place. everyone that I have taken has returned"
"I was back in Chicago 7 days and I ate here 3 times. I miss it that much and the new fish taco they have is much improved. I even dragged my mom and grandma out here the latest visit. My gf loved the pork belly fries and said she could have devoured it all, but she didn't want to look like a glutton."
"If you are looking for something new to try come to Del Seoul. I was feeling a bit adventurous and so was my guy. So we were walking down Clark in Lincoln Park looking to fill our stomachs with something tasty, cheap, but good enough to fill our stomachs. We stumbled upon Del Seoul and saw bright lights and a bunch of people chowing down on some scrumptious looking food. The aroma of food filled the air outside and invited us in. I was giving in to some Korean food temptation. When we went inside everyone looked like a regular and was ordering like a regular. So now I feel incredibly lost because I do not know what to order. I find myself looking, no wait STARING at everyone's food, tempted to ask everyone ""what's that!!!"". But, I don't. I leave it up to Yelp. Hey, that's why God made Yelp right? I order the bulgolgi over rice plate with bok choy. My guy orders Korean beef taco, fish taco, and shrimp taco. My dish was amazing. Sauce filled the plate but didn't drown my food. The bulgogi was so tender and juicy, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. I do not eat fish or anything from the sea/lake/ocean/pond/yougettheidea but he said his favorite was the Korean beef taco and the shrimp. Three Depaul students where sitting next to us and they all ordered shrimp tacos. So there you go shrimp or beef are probably your best choices and the bulgogi plate is a must. We also ordered kimchi fries which were also a tasty treat. The meal took about 10 minutes to make even with a crowd. For three tacos, kimchi fries, bulgogi plate, two drinks, and two satisfied-filled stomachs the bill was $30."
"The idea of Korean tacos and Kimchi fries have been relatively foreign to me. I didn't think it'd even be that great until I tried Del Seoul. During my first visit here, I ordered the Shrimp and Kalbi tacos along with an order of kimchi fries. The prices are fair (3 tacos should be able to fill most people up) and the tacos are absolutely delicious.Del Seoul is definitely trying to innovate with their kimchi fries (since I don't know of where else serves this kind of delicacy) and I have to say that these were delicious as well. They were considerably expensive though for the portion size. This place is worth coming back to Chicago for."
"Been to this place a number of times now and I'm crazy about it. So far I've tried almost all of the tacos, the bulgogi banh mi, the kalbi plate, the kimchi fries, and the gamja fries -- and I'd be lying if I said a single one of them wasn't delicious!I think the tacos stand out above the plates and sandwiches as the highlight of the menu, and the sesame-chili shrimp taco is definitely the best one. So, so good. Love the selection of imported Korean drinks, too. Service has always been friendly and prices are reasonable. Honestly couldn't make a single complaint! Will keep going back for sure."
"Del Seoul, you own my soul!I love your food and I love your prices.  The bah-mi sandwiches make my mouth water and the fries with the garlic dipping sauce are outstanding.A+!"
"I love this place an absurd amount, I get cravings for it on weekend afternoons. The best tacos are the shrimp and pork. The chicken and beef are great as well, but pork and shrimp top my list. You also can't go wrong with the shrimp sandwich, but I like to get a bunch of different tacos because one sandwich is really filling. Reasonably priced, all of the tacos have different and delicious flavors. If you're real hungover or just feeling like a fatty, the kimchi fries are delicious (but artery clogging). I recently tried their bibmbop and it was awesome. Probably my new favorite menu item there, great beef and variety of vegetables included. I've never dined in here, but living close makes it easy to pick up and bring it home."
"Kim chi fries. I. die.I think everything is amazing here. Fish tacos, shrimp tacos, banh mi sandwiches, dumplings...It's a great lunch spot or quick dinner - dine in or takeout.It's good to share with people to try a few different tacos and get an order of the kim chi fries or dumplings. If you're heading home afterwards, get some kim chi to go or some shrimp chips too!"
"The term ""fusion"" is often used to cover up poorly executed cuisine with a blurred sense of origin.  Occasionally a restaurant can fuse different types of cuisine to produce something refreshingly tasty.  Del Seoul has found a delicious home at the crossroads of Mexico City, and Seoul.  While they do offer delivery, the best way to enjoy Del Seoul is to eat in their casual dining room.  The menu offers some traditional Korean eats, such as Bibimbob, and Bulgogi, but the real reason to love Del Seoul is nestled in a flour tortilla.  The tacos are all really well conceptualized, balanced, and built.built.  In each of the offerings, taste buds will detect heat and sweet, soft and crunch, joy and even more joy.  The Fish taco w/ sambal, shrimp, pork, and the Kalbi tacos all feature delicious kimchi, which adds the perfect bite.  The flavors are consistent without being repetitive, and always satisfy.  The Bahn Mi sandwich is great as well, and is quite similar to a traditional Vietnamese sandwich, but with Korean flavors inside.  Don't forget to bring your tongue's passport, because you're about to go on a                    flav-cation......??  No, that didn't work for you?  You get it though."
Awesome place! Love the tacos
"Affordable, contemporary Korean street food served fast and fresh. The same grilled meat appears in tacos, banh mi, BBQ rice plates, and bibimbop. The menu also includes dumplings, gamja fries, and kimchi fries. They sell Korean snacks, candy and drinks (like Pokka coffee). The kimchi is homemade and can be ordered as a side.* Bulgogi bahn mi sandwich ($ 5.95): a hearty sandwich with a toasted soft roll, pickled daikon and carrots (mostly daikon), cilantro, cucumber, sliced jalapeño and aioli. The bread had a nice crunch. I was surprised by how much meat there was, much more so than usual. The bulgogi marinade was a bit sweet and had grilled flavor, not the best but pretty good for a bulgogi sandwich and still warm. The sandwich was fresh, lot of flavors and textures but something seemed off balance. Maybe more carrots and less meat would help. I think I'd rather have homemade kimchi in the sandwich vs. the pickled daikon and carrots."
"Came here after a Chicago-native suggested this place for a non-Chicagoan. I got a Spicy Pork Taco which came with tangy BBQ pork with slaw piled on top of 2 corn tortillas. I also tried the Kalbi which came with a generous amount of perfectly seasoned beef short rib with sides of steamed rice, bok choy, and kimchi. My friends and I shared the K-Town Chicken Wings which were some of the biggest and tastiest wings I have ever had. One of the my friends also got a couple of the Sambal Fish Tacos which she really enjoyed. This is a great little place that seems to get very busy on the weekends, so come early  (or late)! Keep in mind that this is not a BYOB restaurant...we learned the hard way."
"Originally, I was heading for the Austrian Bakery after a long study session at the Next Door Cafe. I was excited when I out of nowhere found Del Seoul on the way. The freakin Bulgogi Banh Mi was soooo delicious!!! What really impressed me was the smokiness in the flavor of the bulgogi. It was just like one of the best restaurants I went to when I was back in Seoul. And to combine that with a vietnamese banh mi twist?! :DSo that was what happened yesterday for dinner. I came back to De Seoul again today for lunch. I really appreciated how the staff recognized me. John the server helped me try the assortment of tacos: Fish, BBQ Pork, and Steak. ....SOOO GOOD!!! I especially loved the fish one. Careful because you might burn your tongue when you bite into the crispy haddock fillet. Spicy and just delicious. The other tacos were great too except that they were difficult to eat because unlike the crispy fish fillet, the contents in these tacos crumbled. Maybe Del Seoul can figure out a way to prevent their tacos from falling out To be honest, it becomes quite a challenge trying to pick up all the bits and pieces of onions and tasty meat out of the basket. I am coming back and getting one of their shirts by the way: the rock, paper, scissors one :D"
"Wow. I have been depriving myself the whole time this place has been open. Today was my first time here and I am hooked. My sister and I were trying to decide between pizza and here. I'm glad she picked Del Seoul.Uh. Kimchee fries? Yeah. I said kimchee fries. I said to my sister that it's a good thing they are not in the South Loop because I would eat these everyday, no joke. The tacos we got were the kalbi, bbq chicken, and fish. SOOO GOOD. Especially the fish taco. I will never eat another fish taco that's not the Del Seoul fish taco again. EVAR. I will definitely come back again. And again. And again."
"There is one item on the Del Seoul menu that keeps me coming back over and over: the sesame-chili shrimp tacos.  They're the best shrimp tacos I've had in Chicago and one of my favorite tacos in the city overall.  The combination of the shrimp and the fresh corn tortillas (corn over flour any day of the week, my friend) is magical.  I can't convince myself to order less than four anytime I go.  The other tacos are fine but aren't as good as the (cheaper) tacos you can get at one of the five hundred Mexican joints throughout the city.  I was a bit disappointed with the Sambal fish tacos because (1) fish tacos are the bomb, (2) they looked beautiful, (3) everyone else raves about them, and (4) they are the most expensive taco Del Seoul offers.  It's not that they taste bad, there just wasn't as much flavor as I had hoped.Other standout menu items include the spicy BBQ pork banh mi sandwich (minus a slight bread-to-ingredient ratio issue) and the Seoul style street dumplings.  The dumplings are great for sharing and are quite filling on their own.  The kimchi fries are worth ordering if that's your thing but I prefer to use that extra stomach space for more shrimp tacos!"
My daughter and I tried this restaurant for our first time and it was delicious! I was recommended the shrimp tacos and Boy oh boy were they cooked to perfection.  My daughter just moved down the block and has a new favorite place to eat. It was our first time and definitely will not be our last.
"I've tried it once and I'm a huge fan! Love their bahn mi sandwhich and their tacos.. I even liked their innovative kimchi fries. I tried their shrimp and kalbi taco, and their spicy pork bahn mi. I've been dreaming about going back because of their delicious food. Their meat was cooked perfectly and juicy, they don't play around with their cut of meat. Their meat is top notch - good stuff. They can easily skimp out on the meat and find not as high quality meat for the amount they are producing, but nope they get the best stuff and you can tell within their products. I would highly recommend this place!"
"This is a great spot, the service is quick and good and it always has a steady flow of business but not an overwhelming place where you can't talk.  The best part is the food, all of the tacos are good and the chicken wings are great.  Their gamja fries also always come out perfect, I sometimes do take out there and after walking the half mile or so home the fries are still have a perfect texture of crunch and don't steam themselves soggy like they would from other places."
"LOVE this place! I can eat their kalbi and shrimp tacos everyday and not get sick of them! They don't skimp on the meat and slaw on the tacos, which is a definite plus. It's about $3 a taco, but you'll definitely order at least 2 (and more if you're really hungry).  I can't wait to come back and try their other plates and flavors!"
"As the product of an interracial relationship I'm all for the combining of many cultures. Unfortunately my mix is not the best possible combination. The award for best interracial mix goes to...(sorry filipina mom and scottish-german dad!)  The Kalbi taco! YUM.I had the korean tacos accompanied by a huge  side of  kimchi fries. Quite possibly the 2nd best thing after korean tacos to grace my tongue.The Korean Mexican mix is hands down the ultimate interracial food combination...until someone invents collard green eggrolls. Waiting for a restaurant to invent that! Until then, the winner of interrcultural food mashup is Del SEOUL!!!!!!"
"Holy crap!!! I asked my Chicagoan friend to take me to a place that was inexpensive, delicious, and Asian. I couldn't have asked for a better place. Their sesame chili shrimp tacos are to die for. I also got the kimchi fries and chicken tacos which were both amazing too. But yes, the shrimp tacos are a must!!"
"What can I say........Yum Yum & Yum!!!! This is one of the first places I ate in when I moved to Chicago. It's nothing fancy, but the food is cheap and delishes. Their shrimp sandwich is a perfect combination of spicy & tangy!!! The tacos are really good as well, and so are the Kimchi Fries!!! This place is sooo good I was going here almost every single day at one point. You can order your food ahead of time & pick it up or you can eat it there. It is extremely convenient and fast."
"Got a craving for some delicious, deep-fried, spicy fish tacos? Of course you do!  Well this is the place to fill up that empty tummy of yours.I love comparing fish taco to fish taco, and honestly this is the top taco I've had.  However, they could either reduce the the size of the fish or make the tortilla a bit larger. My big fish was about to take over.  Hope you love fish sticks :)I've never actually sat down at the restaurant to take in the whole atmosphere. But honestly I like to binge eat at home with my Del Seoul order. I can't let people see how quickly I stuff my face with this stuff.  Seriously. It's a problem.  I get cravings all the time.So if it wasn't for the calories, fat content, and serious salt intake I'd probably be having these fish tacos every week.  What I'm saying is, it's so good you'd probably start to develop a problem if you lived in the area. Don't forget to breath!"
"I heard this place has amazing Korean street tacos.  I stopped in for lunch one Monday with a date to give them a try.  She's a Vegetarian, and had difficulty finding something to eat.  There's only one item on the menu for her, and they won't make any tacos or any of the other dishes without the meat.  She got the Vegetarian Bibimbap and I got three of the tacos.  We sat down with a number and the tacos came out right away.  Being a gentleman I patiently waited for her meal to come out.  And waited, and waited and waited.  Finally she got her dish with an egg right on top.  Guess it's not that vegetarian if there's an egg on it!  The tacos were good, but not mind blowing insanely good.  I would go again if I'm in the area and hungry, but would not go out of my way to go to this place.  I was really disappointed in the service at not timing our meals to come out together.  That should be a basic in the restaurant industry."
"As far as I'm concerned, the realm of Korean Tacos is new territory.  I know there are similar options and it's not exactly ""new"" in the global sense, but compared to vast majority of other restaurants I visit, Del Seoul can at least claim to be significantly more novel in its offerings. Combine that with the fact that it's extremely affordable a 4-star overall rating is downright shameful.I generally get a 3-lot of tacos: Sesame-Chili Shrimp, Kalbi and the pork, and add on an order of the Kimchi Fries.  It's the perfect spot if you need to grab a quick (or even not-so-quick) bite before an event at The Park West."
We wondering into this neighborhood from downtown chicago while traveling and I saw that this place had some really awesome reviews and I love korean food. So we came here for a dinner! I got the bulgogi ban mi and the kim chi fries! Everything was pretty good! Why didn't I think to make a sandwich out of bulgogi! I love bulgogi! My friend got the dumplings and the bulgogi plate! The ports were generous and the prices were ok. The kim chi fries were definitely a creative dish! I loved it! And would definitely try to make it because I'm here on the east coast and no one has attempted to create that dish yet or I'll be traveling back to chicago to eat here again!
"Not so good.  There are so many places to choose from in this fun area but we chose badly.  While the food was flavorful, some choices were quite pricey for what you got.  The pibimpap was a better value but we had trouble even eating it due hard-as-little-rocks rice grains scattered throughout.  The server had mentioned that we needed to be sure to stir the hot crock bowl of rice, vegetables, fried egg and tiny bit of meat.  What he didn't express was that we needed apparently to quickly and vigorously SCRAPE the rice off the bottom so it didn't stick there and overcook.  Ours developed little painful to chew jawbreakers.  When I calmly said we were having trouble, they shrugged it off and said ""we told you to stir it.""  Yes but they didn't say SCRAPE it.  It made that $40 quick meal for 3 seem like something to avoid in the future.  By the way, I've been to Korea several times and had pibimpap many times - never had this problem."
I like this place! Very small casual restaurant on a busy Clark street! I wish they would expand the size of their restaurant since they get so much business. OR they should open another Del Seoul in the South Loop/Chinatown/Bridgeport area!My friends and I came here over the summer to try it out. I forgot all the foods I ordered but I would definitely give this place a 4 stars. It is delicious! I remember I had one of the tacos and I wish I ordered more. The dumplings they have are OK. That would probably be my least favorite but everything else is OMG - GOOD!Definitely need to expand and have more locations.
Good
"Korean BBQ in a taco is nearly always good, and this one is no exception. We also had their wings. It was very tasty, but there was a bit too much sweet glazing that made it too sweet. Unfortunately we didn't try the kimchi fries (lack of hunger, people), but it looks pretty fun."
"More like three and a half stars.  Not too many vegetarian options.  Besides bibimbop and tofu tacos.  Both were tasty, though.  We just beat the dinner rush, otherwise the wait would have been longer.  Service was okay but not spectacular.  Ambiance leaves some wanting."
Tasty and inexpensive. It's an interesting alternative to chipotle or the same old. The fish tacos are good. Could use a few more menu options.
"I grew up in Chicago having all the great food here at my finger tips. And THIS place my friends is some AWESOME and UNIQUE food. I love the fish tacos, best I've had."
"Del Seoul: a clever twist on Korean and Mexican cuisine fusion, capturing the trendy palates of every Lincoln Park college student, out of state implanted hipster, and Young Urban Professional. Is that a bad thing? For the business, absolutely not. The average cost per person is roughly $20 after tax and that has to do wonders for Mr. Kim's growing fortune. However, for the average person who decides to drive down to the area and attempt to find parking, just take a look at the clientele and push on. Although a great concept, you can get better food further North and West of the city for less headache. If you're into hearing the usual foodie responses in the background like ""amazing and absolutely amazing,"" rock on dude.Let's talk about the experience. We (my family of 2 kids and two adults, along with our close friends with their 1 child) luckily found a close parking spot and walked a short block to the restaurant. As we walked in, we were greeted by a young Korean female who seemed disgruntled for some reason. She had the bad mood and smelly love box look all over her face, as she should because she was ugly. I'm sorry, I just keep things one-hundred percent. They set up a long table for us and then took our orders. Old Yeller was training the young female at the register and suggested to me that the bbq chicken kids meal is spicy. Ok. So take it off the frigging menu option, genius.  The menu is simple enough and really isn't impressive, given the amount of hype that's been floating around about this place. Sweet meat tacos, that's their concept. Korean style preparation, paired with a corn tortilla, and there you have it. I can't really speak too much on the food because it's just that simple. Simple enough to opt for a gyro sandwich closer to home next time. I think the price corresponds with the portions, but certainly nothing that's going to make me want to drive from the suburbs to damn near the lake.So, all in all, my conclusion about Del Seoul Taco is try it once. Kick yourself in the nards if you find yourself craving it because you can achieve the same greatness with brown sugar, your Johnson, and a nice companion from Backpack.com. One."
"First time in? I'd do what I did and bring in a mess of friends to do the street food thing, cover a table in tacos, banh mi sandwiches, dumplings, and fries.Kimchi fries? A tasty start. Not overwhelmingly kim-chee-y as you might expect. But a tangy blend of flavors (most of which are the usual suspects, cheese and sour cream, porky bits) over fried up shoestring potatoes.Dumplings? Hot and tasty meatiness in a little package. It loves you. You should love it too.Bulgogi sandwiches? Surprisingly like good Vietnamese banh mi should (and being Viet, I know a couple things about banh mi). Probably the best value on the menu, too.And the star, the tacos? Pretty good, I almost liked the sandwiches better (sandwiches were probably more satisfying). Kalbi was good, but wasn't quite the big, over-the-top kalbi experience that you might expect from KBBQ. Sesame-chili shrimp, also good, but hey, spicy fried shrimp, what could be bad about it.Overall, a good choice."
"I been dying to try this place out because its resemblance to Kolgi's Truck back in LA. However, my experience here was only okay. I ordered the Kalbi Taco, Shrimp Taco and Kimchi Fries. They are known for their Shrimp Tacos, however, I prefer the Kalbi much better. Kalbi was nice and tender. Over all, both tacos were good; I just wished the sauce or the seasoning of the veggies was more spicy or a kick of something. I felt nothing was there to complement the meat. As for the kimchi fries, these were great. The kimchi could be spicier, we had to add sriracha. My friend order their new poutine fries, which was only okay. The purple onions were really great but aside from that nothing real special. I still preferred the kimchi fries.For Chicago, Del Seoul is great! But coming from LA and having tried Kolgi's, Kolgi's wins my vote. Definitely check this place out. It's probably the closest thing to good Korean/Mexican food you'll find in Chicago."
"This place is definitely good.the Short rib tacos are my favorite, and i keep coming back.service is fast and efficient.hits the spot."
"Yum^3. The first time I came here was 4 years ago right before I left Chicago to move to NYC, and after having them again today, I can say the tacos are as delicious as they were then. I could marry that Kalbi taco. That sweet, deliciously marinated beef totally hit the spot tonight after an unexpected and unfortunate day of too-sour, too-bitter tastes. The sesame-chili shrimp was tasty and flavourful as well, but Kalbi was my jam tonight. The tacos are pretty well stuffed, but if you so desire, you can just separate the two tortillas and ration the delightful contents between them. Also, the staff were pretty nice too. I called ahead of time about when the kitchen closes since I knew we wouldn't make it there until 5 min or less before closing time (10PM). The guy was nice and said as long as we were in the door, we would be golden. They also were cool about us eating in, despite strolling in 5 min before closing on Saturday. Overall, Korean tacos so full of win, I almost wanted to go again the next day, but settled with always making a stop when I come back to Chicago."
"This is no-frills, fast food style, so if you want to eat and run, but also want something vaguely Korean and also kind of Mexican and sort of Vietnamese, this is your place.  Because clearly that happens all the time.We got the kimchi fries and a sesame chili shrimp bahn mi.  Both were solidly done.  I could have done with some more kimchi and a lot more pork belly on the fries (it was indistinguishable) but luckily the fries themselves were good enough to eat plain.  As for the bahn mi, it was fresh, well-balanced, spicy, and at $6.50, the most expensive banh mi I've ever had or probably ever will have.But it's Lincoln Park... what do you expect."
"My ex-girlfriend recommended this place (bless her soul) and I've always seen it crowded so I really wanted to like it but it just didn't happen--partially because I've had amazing Korean food elsewhere.  My friend owed me a lunch so I suggested here.  Now we will spend good money when justified but he was disappointed that the bill was $25 for 4 chicken tacos and side order of dumplings. The tacos were decent but the dumplings were pretty awful--to the point where we didn't finish them. Now there's something really wrong in the state of IL when we don't finish our appetizers--trust me on this! I know what good dumplings are and these tasted like frozen bagged food. The ambiance and decor are nice and the clientele was progressive and trendy as expected in the heart of Lincoln park, which is why it's so popular. Even so, I'd rather go to a hole-in-the-wall with great food than here again due to the fact that we were still hungry and had to eat elsewhere after eating here. Gonna hit up my ex for a dinner she now owes me because of this!"
"I really enjoyed this place!I went back for the fish tacos two days in a row and also tried the kimchi fries.  Both of these were excellent.  I wouldn't say this place is inexpensive, but the food is well worth it.  I will definitely return there sometime."
"Eh.I really don't know why people like this place so much. It's overrated in my opinion. I get it, the concept is cool: Familiar ingredients in a new (not really) package. However, it's just... lacking. Or is it just not worth it? Don't get me wrong, they aren't bad at all. The thing is right after I throw down on 5 tacos I'm left with a lingering craving for actual Korean BBQ. I'm talkin' the whole shebang with kalbi, samgyeopsal, and all the banchan my heart desires. Instead I've spent $20 on TACOS. I'm just sayin', if I'm spending that much, I might as well go to Cho Sun Ok. With all that said, the shrimp tacos are actually the best.Oh yeah, don't even bother with the kimchi fries. It sounds awesome, but the cheese gets cold quickly (gee, maybe from putting cold kimchi on it?) and you're left with a giant brick that you ponder if it will taste good after nuking. It won't."
Gangnam Style in your mouth!!!!!!!!This place is awesome!
Definitely get:   the shrimp tacos - one of the tastier things on the menu.    Reminds me of one of LA's yummy food trucks.   The taco garnishing/filling hits the spot.Definitely skip:  the dumplings.   They're rather bland (sorry) and served on a silicone tray/mat.Great snack spot.  3 tacos and I'm stuffed.
"Hadn't even planned on coming here but had been craving Korean and this is honestly the first decent Korean place I'd seen in months (I live downtown)... So I stopped in to see the menu... And then ordered the soon dobu while my boyfriend got food down the block. A crazy diverse crowd, it was lovely. My soon dobu was pretty good too, with lots of seafood and very filling. Only a couple tiny pieces of beef though, and not spicy at all. Definitely good considering the selection in the area."
I had the fish taco and the fries and I instantly fell in love! Absolutely delicios! I will be back for sure!
Had all the tacos which were good bim bop and dumplings pretty good a little pricey
"Tell me if this sounds familiar: You're gradually building your town. All sorts of buildings. A barracks, a refinery, maybe even a cybernetics core. All of a sudden a booming voice bellows. ""YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS"". Total night wrecker, right?Not anymore.Del Seoul is South Korean BBQ done right. The shrimp tacos are the highlight, and they are recommended. Crunchy shrimp, sesame bits, and sauce. Have these South Korean tacos, and feel South Korean. Become South Korean."
"Came here with a friend on a whim and a recommendation. We got the dumplings, kalbi and shrimp tacos, the K-town chicken wings and kimchi fries.The dumplings were good and filled with vegetables and minced jap chae noodles. The K town chicken wings weren't as crispy as Crisp and the sauce is more of a traditional black vinegar sauce, but they were good and I would get them again. The Kimchi fries were ok, its kimchi, small pork belly pieces and fries. It was good, but it was nothing special either and I wished it was spicier, that would have made it a bit better. The tacos were really good, nice flavor, the meats were done right and seasoned nicely, my only complaint was that the tortilla were not prepared correctly. You know the bad texture when you take a store bought tortilla and start eating it without heating it? Yeah, the tortillas were that texture...Wish everything was more spicy as I am more use to eating spicy, but definitely would come again though."
"Korean bbq taco, what's not to like about the idea of this place?This is the kind of stuff I chased around taco trucks in LA for. Great selection at a very decent price, you MUST check this place out if you are ever in mood for good food, yes, it's just plain good. If i lived in Lincoln Park, I would probably be at this joint at least 2-3x a week, but sadly, living downtown doesn't allow for that convenience.Now for the food. 1) Tried all 4 types of tacos: I'd have to say the best ones IMO were the shrimp taco and kalbi tacos,  but the spicy pork and chicken definitely were not bad at all.2) The dumplings: this one was ok, not exactly easy to find steamed dumplings so +1 for that. But they weren't spectacular so if it's your first time, probably worth skipping this one.3) Kimchi and Pork Belly fries: topped with cheese, this whale of a dish probably packs more calories than one would ever need in any single meal and tastes amazing probably because of the unhealthy nature of it. The kimchi adds somewhat of a ""healthy"" element to the dish, but the fatty, cheesy, kimchi-y parts of the dish combine to form a super appetizer. Definitely worth a try.Saw many people order the kalbi and bulgogi and definitely will have to give that a shot the next time I'm here.Ambience: simple and small restaurant. Not a whole lot of tables in this place so they require you to order first and they will assign you a table after you order.If you're ever in the area or are remotely close, this place is definitely a worthwhile venture for some great food to satiate that korean bbq fix..... in a taco form."
"The environment was nothing to rave about but the food...ohhh lawdy- delicious! I had two tacos, one with shrimp and the other with tenderloin. Both were very good and had great blends of favors. My friend and I also shared the Kimchi Fries. Next time I'm in town, I would not hesitate to come here again (and bring friends)!"
"Finally back from a long Yelp hiatus!Personally, I think Asian fusion is really hit or miss.  Fusion for fusion's sake is usually a recipe for disaster.  Finding exotic flavors, ingredients, and cooking techniques that really work well with each other is not a simply endeavor.  With that said, I've had many delicious Asian-inspired tacos from places like Korilla (NYC) and Tamari (Pittsburgh).  With high expectations, I ordered a shrimp taco, kalbi taco, and kimchi pork belly fries for dinner.The shrimp was an excellent mix of crunch, salty, sweet, spicy, and tangy.  The kalbi was good too.  Sadly, the tortillas were somewhat of a disappointment.  They were tiny, so there was plenty of overflowing filling, and I could barely fold them in half without causing a small avalanche of delicious vegetables.  There were two layers on each taco, so they were a bit overpowering, and they were also harder and gritter than some of the corn tortillas that I've had before.  The tacos would have been much better off on 1 larger tortilla instead of 2 tiny ones.The fries were delicious, and they probably rank #1 on my drunk food list right now.  $7 is a bit steep, but it's a pretty big order.This place has tons of potential, but a little more work on the tacos is needed."
"I've been to the best taco places in Chicago: taco joint & de cero, but it's the Koreans that have it right! :)True foody pl: wild array of tastes combined with familiar and new.Kimchi fries for example.Skip the dumplings, good, but so many better choices here.Can't wait to come back n try more."
"Dear Del Soul,I love you. I dreamt of your sandwiches the other night and can't get you out of my head. I look forward to coming back to Chicago to visit so that I can visit you again. The Bulgogi sandwich was melt in your mouth delicious. The flavors paired with the crisp bread, all I can is I was one happy camper. The Sesame-Chili Shrimp sandwich was insanely good. The sweet and spicy components were so good. I seriously have been dreaming of the deliciousness  since eating here and wish that I could transport myself back to Chicago. Until next time....Love,Me"
This place is a gem! Kinda pricey but worth every bit. Love the Kolbi tacos. Its a fusion of Mexican-Korean. My fiance starts bouncing all over the place nearly to the point where she flips my car over when I ask her if she wants to come here.
"Everyone else has said it already, but holy smokes this place is incredible. The Spicy Pork BBQ Bahn Mi is awesome, as are the Kalbi and Short Rib tacos.Pro-tip - the Kimichi fries might be a little over priced at $6.95, and are very heavy,  comparable to a basket of chilli cheese fries absolutely LOADED"
"I dig it. Before today, the only ""Korean"" tacos I've had were at Ferry Building Thursdays in San Francisco and they consisted of nori ""tortilla"", rice, and bulgogi. Del Seoul's tacos are more of a regular taco, with Korean-esque fillings, and I have to say that the double corn tortilla trumps the nori ""tortilla"" easily. Came here to lunch with my favorite Frenchie today. We ordered the pork belly kimchi fries, the steamed mandoo (Korean dumplings) and all the tacos (short rib, chicken, battered shrimp, pork).DELICIOUS. The steamed mandoo were straight up Korean and a favorite of mine. This is expected though (I am Chinese = I inhale dumplings). Served on a steamer basket with a dipping sauce, it is a large order, so bring friends to share. The pork belly kimchi fries were decent. It sounds more exciting that it is. I wanted more KIMCHI flavor - like, intense fermented and spicy kimchi flavor - but no such luck. The tacos were tasty - the pork and shrimp were my favorites. I wish the slaw toppings different for the different proteins though as the meat tacos tasted pretty similar. Tasty, but similar - I like variety.I will definitely be back, probably next week! I was ogling everyone's banh mi sandwiches and rice plates and the staff is friendly (and the best red velvet cupcake in town is down the street)."
"This was my 2nd time visiting Del Seoul and for quick, fast and inexpensive meals, this is one of my favs! The 1st time I tried the Kalbi Bento Box dinner, which was only ok, The greens/salad was very basic and boring and the meat had several, un-chewable fatty pieces of meat. But, my fault, I ordered the wrong thing. I finally got to give Del Seoul another try this past weekend and was not disappointed! This time I ordered 3 tacos which were super delicious. The spicy BBQ pork taco was the best with it's fresh cilantro relish, a great combo of Korean and Mexican! My 2nd fav was the Kalbi/beef short rib, no fatty pieces here. And my second fav (if I can do that), the Sambal fish. I got a large piece of fish which was lightly breaded, moist and tender.  My companion has eaten here on several occasions and highly recommends the Sesame-Chili Shrimp tacos. This time he got the fully loaded Kalbi Poutine, which I got to sample. Super, long, crisp french fries doused in some secret cheese sauce complete with meat, a new version of eat your meat and potatoes. Next time I visit, I'd like to try the Kimchi Fried Rice, the table next to us ordered this and it came boiling in the stone pot, looked delicious. Great place for hanging out with friends or family. y only question: are the clients suppose to clear their table or the staff, idk?"
"A very interesting fusion going on here.  Using Asian-marinated / seasoned meats in a tortilla with veggies and sauce???  Hmmm... Why didn't I think of that?  I now find myself taking leftovers from last night's dinner and tossing them in tortillas the next day!  Still, Del Seoul has some items that are tasty.Liked the Kalba, Fish, Pork and Shrimp tacos.  I wish they were a little more generous with the shrimp though.  It seemed like I was eating a mouth full of veggies and sauce.Everything else was fine.  I also agree with most that the fries weren't great.  I heard a lot of hype about em... It was alright, but ehhh...  it didn't ""fuse"" together well imo..."
"I have eaten at Del Seoul twice in the past six months. The first time I had the shrimp sandwich. I can honestly say it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The bread was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The shrimp were perfectly seasoned and all of the flavors were wonderfully balanced. Today I went back with my husband. I had a shrimp taco and a BBQ pork taco. My husband had the BBQ pork sandwich. We loved all three. The menu is really creative with unique ingredient combinations, but you can tell that each item on the menu is well thought out. I can't wait to go back!"
I just had lunch.  Delicious.  I especially liked the fish and shrimp tacos.  The pork and beef were also excellent.  This place is a bargain.  They posted a sign in the window that they may soon have a liquor license.  Nice.
Love this place!!!!I've tried everything on the menu and they never dissapoint!
"After being in LA and trying the Kogi truck, the idea of Korean tacos in Chicago sounded right up my alley. I heard about Del Seoul and had to give them a try. Turns out they are damn good. Not as great as Kogi but still pretty good. I tried the Kalbi, BBQ Pork, and BBQ Chicken. The BBQ Pork one was my stand out favorite. I also went with the side of dumplings which were excellent. Fast service and good eats can't ask for much better."
"Had a stupid tasty feast here yesterday.* Bulgogi banh mi was great* Dumplings are delicious* Kimchi fries were pretty good, maybe could've been stronger w/ the kimchiLimited and modest seating situation keeps it @ 4 stars, but they are remodeling this weekend so maybe that will get in line with the 5 star food."
"I came to Del Seoul on the Saturday night, and apparently just before the rush. I had the hot stone bowl bibimbop, and they happily accommodated my request to substitute the ribeye steak with chicken. It was very, very good! Everyone at our table, including my half-Korean boyfriend, enjoyed their meals. The only complaint would be one friend's meal took exceptionally long. Perhaps they forgot about hers? Also, the place is pretty small, so tables fill up quickly.I plan to definitely return."
I absolutely love the bibimbap bowls here: the beef and veggies are always delicious!!! Their steamed dumplings are outstanding too. This place is a great value!
"All I can really say is that this was my first real Korean BBQ experience, and I've been a fan ever since.  Now I realize this isn't the authentic deal (I've been lectured on this quite a bit) but for a newbie in the foodie world, I don't mind dipping my toe in before taking a plunge.  The first time I stopped in, I was informed that the Bulgolgi tacos were a staple, so I paired it with my favorite, the fish tacos.  Both were great.  Full of flavor and relatively cheap.My friend and I also ordered a tray of kimche fries.  I asked how many we wanted to get but he assured me that one would be plenty.  He was right.  There's some pretty generous portions with the fries.  Overall a great experience and I'll definitely go back."
"Simply put, the best Korean food ever!This place is clean, unassuming and serves fantastic Korean food. My friend who lives in Seoul said Del Seoul's food tastes like something she gets at home (on the more delicious end). Try their bibimbap.Great prices, too! Must visit."
"Totally yummy.  The kimchi fries are a sin. And, their super fast carry out makes it oh-so-easy when you're not in the mood to cook, go out to dinner, or wait for delivery.  The new tofu taco is too hot for my taste but I'd love it if they made a milder version."
"I was in Chicago for business and asked a friend where we should meet for dinner.  He suggested Del Seoul based on reviews he had heard.They are apparently known for their tacos, but since I wasn't really in a taco mood I ordered the hot stone bibimbop.  Partly because I like saying that word and partly because I like bibimbop.  It takes much longer than tacos so if the rest of your group is getting tacos you may want to either buckle under the pressure or suffer while they devour tacos.  It is worth the wait and then they will be forced to watch you eat your amazing bowl.The restaurant looks like a Chipotle or some other chain like that, but it's not.  For counter-service Korean this is definitely the place to go in Lincoln Park."
Food made me ill and was not even tasty to boot.
I got take out and it was quick!I ordered a few different things to try and I was pleased with the options and speed with which my items were ready to go. I will be back to try other items! the KimChi Fries were delicious.
"Really, really good. The kalbi tacos, the shrimp tacos, the kimchi fries, the rib plates--everything here is simply spectacular."
"Again the shrimp tacos never cease to amaze me!the kalbi sandwich was quite a delight, def. better than pho ha's viet sandwiches!"
I put A-OK then went up one star to see what Yelp had to say and I do agree - Yay! I'm a fan. I really am. My wife & I ordered almost everything off the menu (smaller sized items of most things) and even the TEA was great! Highly recommend the Spicy Pork BBQ plate... Chili Shrimp Tacos... and any of their teas. Why are you still reading this? Get up and get over there! :)
"Absolutely terrific value and taste. Kalbi plate is very tasty. The shrimp and kalbi tacos are wonderful. The kimchi fries are OK. I personally love the standard french fries and ketchup combo, but i found the kimchi twist interesting but not amazing. Highly recommend this place. GREAT prices, great food."
"I am not lying when I say that sometimes I lay in bed at night thinking about the tacos from Del Seoul. This place is AMAZING! It's kind of a fusion on Korean food with some Mexican concepts. Who cares what it is really? Just go! Get the shrimp and Kalbi tacos. You wont be disappointed. They also have some more traditional Korean dishes on the menu, but I have never had them so I can't really comment, but they look good. Also, the employees are all really nice and helpful."
"Strong showing. A friend brought me here for some Korean tacos.  Very casual, relaxed place. Food took a bit to come out, and it was piece by piece, but it was outstanding. Fish and kimchee tacos were delicious. Prices were great - less than $30 for two people eating a full dinner.   Drinks came in cans which was a little odd, but fits in with the nature of the restaurant.  Help was very friendly. Highly recommended if you are looking for a casual, affordable lunch or dinner in Lincoln Park."
"Awesome! Now the trend that started in LA has finally made it over to the midwest. The food here is pretty good. Had all 5 of the tacos and I loved every single one of them except for the fish taco, do not get that one. I didn't like it much. My favorite was the shrimp taco.Customer service was adequate but not the cleanest. But you come here for the food, not for the place and service."
I dream about this place in my sleep. Every time I eat here I cry....the food is delicious
"I have a love / hate relationship with Del Seoul.  I absolutely love the food.  The bulgolgi sandwhich is the perfect balance of flavors delightfully wrapped in a soft french roll.  All the tacos are fantastic. The Kalbi (grilled short rib) taco with the tangy seasame slaw or the perfectly fried shrimp.  Even the Bi Bim Bop is fantastic (though not as good as the other in my humble opinion).  Its all done really well for a reasonable price.Now the hate part, I hate that I never want to go anywhere else.  I hate that I go to get other Banh Mi sandwhiches and will perpetually disappointed (with the exception of getting actual Banh Mi in Vietnam, that was out of control good).  Its just so good that it doesn't make other places near by worth going to because you'll just be disappointed and wish you went to del seoul instead. This place is great, nothings wrong with it, keep on doing what you're doing and I will continue to love / hate you for it."
"Mmm tacos.  I like them lots and lots, thanks!"
"With my first bite of mandoo (dumpling) dipped in ganjang (soy sauce) i was in love. Since then, i've been back at least once every 2 weeks and had almost everything on the menu.The spicy pork banh mi is def my favorite so far - spicy marinated pork balanced by the cooling dakion and carrots. An AMAZING balance of flavors-would highly recommend. The street dumplings seriously take me back to sleepovers at my grandma's house and her amazing cooking...!Also love the tacos-have tried every variety and the sesame-chili shrimp was my favorite. Has a good kick to it. The galbi BBQ place is also very good.Look forward to returning to this place over and over!"
we were at the area and my wife was craving for french fries and she liked the pictures of this place and then i found it on my bookmark list which was great.we had a small difficulty finding the place as the sign is not that alerting and a big truck was right in front of it.anyways the place seemed descent i ordered the shrimp taco which was okay and the kalbi taco which was good.my wife had the poutine fries which was good as well.i would consider coming to the place again
"There are two things I consider the highest compliment I can pay a restaurant: repeat business, and taking friends visiting from out-of-town. I give Del Seoul both.I used to work down the street and was hesitant to stop in for lunch breaks, but my coworkers convinced me to check it out one day and I could not be happier. They are known for their Korean-inspired tacos and for good reason. My favorite is the Sesame-chili Shrimp taco featuring tempura shrimp, kimchi, and a sauce that will knock your socks off. Don't be scared off by the name, this taco is not spicy, just a well balanced blend of flavors that will stick with you long after you finish. My second favorite is the Kalbi (grilled beef short-rib) taco. The beef is well-seasoned, tender, and leaves you wanting more. I have also tried the Spicy BBQ Pork taco with equally great results. Friends I've dined with rave over their Banh Mi sandwiches, the BBQ Plates, and the fish tacos. The dumplings are equally great, but I prefer to fill up on the tacos themselves. I took my parents here on a visit this spring. Despite their reluctance, they decided to give it a shot after I raved about the food. After one bite they were sold. My dad had the fish and shrimp tacos while my mom copied me and got the shrimp and beef tacos. Let's just say we'll be going back on their next visit.In short, you should drop in and try a couple tacos, a banh mi sandwich or a plate of their delicious dumplings. You'll be glad you did."
"It was my first visit to Chicago, and the first thing that I ate was at Del Seoul. I had the kalbi and shrimp tacos, which were amazing! The beef taco reminded me of authentic South Korea grilled beef, which is rare. The shrimp were cooked perfectly, with a great batter. The slaw and dressing were great mix, and add a nice crunch and texture to the taco.  These are some of best tacos that I've had. I love the Korean fusion tacos. They are cheap and not too big, which means that you can a variety of different tacos.Get the fries to if you get the chance, the mayo dressing it comes with is really good. If I ever come back to Chicago, I'd definitely visit Del Seoul again. It is a must visit food stop."
"It's been so long since I've yelped...I may be rusty with this review but not with my eating (i've been probably eating more since I stopped yelping).  first of all, to all my koreans, leave the tacos to our mexican brothers and sisters.  Why are you try to do this fusion thing and ruin everything?  Koreans, would you be happy if any other culture played around with our kimchi?  Fusion dishes gotta be done with a lot of respect and care.  I thought the galbi tacos were just aight.  My brother's spicy bbq pork grille came out ok.  But what I loved was the spicy pork bahn mi.  Now, that's what I'm talking about.  I haven't had Korean/Vietnamese fusion till this point and the flavors went so well together.  Del Seoul did a great job adding large and fresh portions of Vietnamese veggies mixed with Korean's very own spicy pork.   I have an African-American friend named Del and he is closer to Seoul flavor than this galbi taco to mexico/korea."
I love del soul! The spicy shrimp taco is amazing as is every thing else I have had. The perfect place to go for a quick bite and still have an awesome meal.
"Korean, Mexican, and a splash of Vietnamese. It wasn't what I expected, but I thought the food was pretty good for the price. Very small restaurant.My first impress of Del Seoul was not a good one. As we were about to order, I noticed table opening up, so I decided to put my jacket on the chair. One of the staff seemed to have somewhat of a problem with that (apparently, there's a sign that say we need to order our food first).I'm the type of person who likes to eat family style so we can all try a little bit of everything. This is not the place to do that. I asked for plates and they hesitated, trying to figure out what to do. Instead, they gave me baskets with the wax paper. It kinda worked. Sorta, until I cut through it and now I'm eating off the plastic basket that may or may not been cleaned. Dangit. Good thing I'm immune to all sickness.-We tried all the tacos. They were pretty good and affordable.-The kalbi was also cheap, but I wasn't feeling it as much as traditional Korean BBQ. Mainly because I like to cook mine a certain way.-Kimchi fries were good, but pricey for what you get. I barely even saw my pork belly. What's up with that?Overall, I had an okay experience there. Definitely a place to try at least once."
"kogi tacos were yummy. meat was tender. slaw was good but too much sesame oil. shrimp tacos were one of the favs, but i felt it was too greasy.  fried shrimp with some sort of aioli sauce topped with slaw.  similar to kogi truck in LA!!"
"Go here for the Korean tacos. They have several different kinds and they all taste different. I suppose this shouldn't be surprising but I expected all of the meats to have a similar marinade. Not true! They were all equally good in exciting and distinct ways.I went back and tried the bi bim bop. It came in a hot stone bowl that made the rice become crunchy at the bottom, which was fun. But honestly the bi bim bop was just mediocre - stick with this place's specialty, the tacos, and you won't be disappointed. I also give them creativity points for their cool selection of extras, like shrimp chips, which are my favorite."
"Of the Capital of South Korea, I am intrigued.Located on one of my favorite city blocks in the City of Chicago, mainly because Aloha and Molly's, Del Seoul doesn't really stand out, visually that is. It does, however, stand out food-wise.I'm always interested in food trends, and I hear Korean taco trucks are making some noise out on the west coast, and I'm not talking ""The Entertainer"" by Scott Joplin like ice cream trucks. The idea is so simple, taking Korean-styled meats and filling tortillas with them.With that said, my girlfriend and I showed up and really didn't know what to order, so I took initiative and ordered one of each type of taco [kalbi, pork, chicken, and shrimp] in addition to the kimchi fries. Taco-wise, here's how I would rank them, shrimp is top dog by far, kalbi second, chicken numero tres, and finally the pork rounds out the foursome. Don't get me wrong, they were tasty, but that ranking went through a computer-based algorithm similar to that of the BCS. It doesn't lie. But in all seriousness, the shrimp really was the best. Something about the sesame-chili aioli.The kimchi fries [topped with cheeses, sour cream, scallions, onions, and pork belly] were...meh. I saw pork belly in the description and my mouth began to salivate like a Pavlovian dog. But when the fries actually came out, I was not too impressed. Not gonna lie, some good old fashion bacon would've been better.Of the Capital of South Korea, I am intrigued...and like Lt. Gen. Douglas MacArthur said, ""I shall return."" Wait, that was in the Philippines. Oops!"
"Went here on a weekday evening... and had no problem getting a table.  Ordered a spicy pork taco, kalbi taco, shrimp taco, and gamja fries. The shrimp and spicy pork tacos were my favorite, but all of the tacos were very good... and you really can't go wrong with any of them.Will definitely be back, and soon."
"Anyone who's into food has no doubt by now heard of the Korean taco craze made famous by the Kogi Taco Truck in LA (which by the way, is even better than reviews make it out to be).  It was a great surprise to me to find Korean tacos in Chicago, as while the city is known for its culinary history, I personally go to Chicago for deep dish pizzas and ""dawgs"", not fusion food.  I'm happy to report that Del Seoul's tacos are delicious. My friend and I bought one of each type and shared them.  My particular favorite was the pork.  These Korean tacos didn't quite bring the enjoyment that washed over me when I had a Kogi taco in LA, but then again I wasn't buzzed post-night-on-the-town in California weather either.  Del Seoul continues the tradition of a great idea and adds great value to the tradition of diversity and culinary delight in Chicago.  My only complaint, if you can call it that, is that the place is somewhat small so seating can be difficult."
"Admittedly, I don't know much about Korean food and based on what I've tried so far, I'd say I'm rather lukewarm on it. I'm happy to see something interesting has taken over this space. The space is small and the remodel isn't fancy, but it's a nice improvement over the crepe place. The staff and surroundings definitely make it feel welcoming.On my first visit I ordered the shrimp banh mi and the gamja fries. Flavor-wise, the banh mi was everything I hoped my sandwich at Sunda was not. I would prefer the shrimp weren't breaded, but enjoyed the mix of flavors on the sandwich. However, the gamja fries fell flat with me. It may have been a fluke, but my fries seemed undercooked and unseasoned. On the upside, the garlic-sesame aioli was rather tasty.The second time I popped in for a quick lunch and ordered two of the shrimp tacos. The tacos were fine, but rather heavy on the slaw - I recommend having a fork handy. They had a nice little kick to them, but again I prefer my shrimp not breaded. They seemed a bit pricey for what I got, I can't say I'd be rushing back for this item.Bottom line: 3.5 stars. It's a nice little spot that I'd return for another shrimp banh mi, I'm just not in a hurry to make it back."
This place has the best sesame chili shrimp tacos! They are like bang bang shrimp. The flavor is really addictive. I have  been back so many times I cannot count. The only negative I can think of is that the taco's used to be cheaper but they went up by $1 in the past year. I am a taco lover for life!
"Kalbi tacos are awesome but its fatal flaw is in its Kim chi slaw, topping that is, which doesn't reheat well but contains an interesting flavor combo. Best when eaten warm. At $2.50 per taco it's not a bad price, though others in my group had differing opinions. Kalbi is Korean BBQ, so think one helping piece of meat wrapped in a typical sized corn tortilla and topped with shredded Kim Chi and other tasty junk. It's Yum. Actually more yum if it was a four tortilla, I bore of Chicago's corn tortilla craze. We were Korean taco tripping through the city and this was our first stop, arrived too late to dine and got our goodness to go. Slamming them down our throats on the way to our next destination was messy but yummy. While waiting I enjoyed a Korean grape drink. Typical brands are Bon Bon, Po Do sac or Sac Sac. It's a clear liquid with a grape flavoring and at the bottom are a few jelly sacks. A nice unusual, so just try it. Few tables and chairs and off to one side of the order counter a wait area for we. Almost twenty minutes wait for a couple Kalbi tacos, spicy BBQ chicken and pork tacos. It was still busy at closing. On the walk out I gazed over the food a couple silently devoured. Tacos, dumplings and edamame. I gotta come back and have that combo! After our Korean taco trip, we realized this is the must try place, forget about the rest. Bookmark!"
"I usually don't like any sort of Asian fusion, but I loved Del Seoul. Korean bugolgi banh mi, yum! Kalbi tacos? Yum!Kimchi fries?! Yum!What a bizarre combination of food. Korean-Vietnamese. Korean-Mexican. Korean-American. It's as if the restaurant is going through some sort of identity crisis, but don't come out of it anytime soon! I love the concept. I will be back for sure!"
"Great food here at Del Seoul. Their Korean tacos are so good! I get my fix here at least once in a couple of weeks. It can be a bit pricey but hey, look at the area. The staff is pretty friendly as well and stay pretty composed when it gets busy - like line out the door busy. It can also get crazy for seating when it gets that busy but it is a popular spot. Sometimes, it takes a while for the food but I have been here so much that I can't really complain about it. If you like tacos - any tacos, then go to Del Seoul and try something different! You'll like it - I promise!"
"Tacos+Korean street food = sheer perfection.  My friend has talked up Del Seoul for a while and was in utter disbelief that I had never experience it before.  Being a fellow foodie, I knew that her rave reviews were well qualified.  Spontaneously, we decided that a trip to the north side on a rainy, foggy Chicago summer day was just the pick me up we needed.  I was concerned that our tennis attire would leave us a bit underdressed for a lunch outing.  She assured me that this was not going to be a problem.  I understood why as soon as we walked in.  The ambiance here is nothing to rave about.  You go up to the register, place your order, take a number and wait for your food to be brought out in what can be best described as a diner setting.  What the restaurant lacks in ambiance, it more than makes up for in awesomeness of flavor.  My friend and I ordered the BBQ chicken tacands pricy grilled chicken, cilantro-onion relish, secret slaw, toasted sesame seeds) and the Sesame Chili  Shrimp tacos which were voted best taco for excellent reasons  (panko crusted shrimp, cilantro-onion relish, their secret slaw, and toasted sesame seeds) and shared an order of the Seasoned Gamja Fries(seasoned French fries with garlic aioli).  Everything was mouth wateringly delicious.  It was a party in my mouth upon first bite. I knew I was falling in love and falling hard.  I'm not sure how I will ever be able to eat regular tacos again.Del Seoul has excited me to come back and try the other items on their their menu.  I have a feeling this is the start of a torid love affair."
Super quick and super tasty! Reasonable priced considering the ingredients in the tacos and how much meat I got. Will visit again for sure!
"I love the name of this place. Anything with ""Del"" always sounds kind of 1950's and then there's the play-on-words with soul. So it could easily be a name of for a musical group. But it sure makes a good restaurant name, and they sure make some tasty Korean tacos.I am probably one of the few who have eaten here alone, but having lunch around 3:30 makes it easy to dine solo. I stopped in here, chatted a bit with the friendly counter guy, consulting him as a new customer here. He was helpful and actually suggested ordering less food than I'd intended. I chose one of each of the shrimp, beef and pork tacos with a side of fries. A drink. $12 bucks total. And boy, did I enjoy the combination of fresh ingredients, Korean flavors and textures, and the mayo-dip for the fries. Very Belgian touch, there. So, that, with the Mexican, the Korean, and the Perrier, made for quite the international mixed bag. Sitting at a table in the front window, I think I entertained some passers-by. They smiled as they witnessed my obvious slobbering over lunch.Perhaps one of the best things about this taco joint is the complete lack of baskets of bare nachos or re-fried beans as a side. Amen to that. Talk about a fresh, creative approach. And I must return for the Bi Bim Bop which I failed to include with my tacos this time. Definitely a favorite Lincoln Park lunch stop. And a great name for an R&B group, should they decide to start one."""
"I've been wanting to go here for a while, but I've never really found the opportunity.Sambal Fish -  Fish was cooked really nicely. I was excited about this one because I thought the sambal flavor would be prominent. The slaw provided a nice contrast to the battered and fried fish, but was not strong in flavor. The slaw by itself definitely lacks flavor.Sesame Chili Shrimp - After tasting this I understood why this was a popular choice. Really great flavor, slaw had great flavor that could stand up on its own. Pros - good food, reasonably pricedCons - cost of food could add up given they are sold in individual servingsI'll probably be going back there again to try other things."
"After months waiting for this joint to open, I found this past Saturday it was finally open, which is sad because I live around the corner from it and they have been open for a couple of weeks (had no knowledge they were open yet).Not a very big place as I think there are 7 tables for seating, but thats ok. I looked at the menu on the plasma TV on the wall and had a hard decision to make. I asked the girl behind the counter if she had to choose, would she choose the BBQ Pork or BBQ Chicken sandwich? She told me to go with the pork. Great choice as it was really good. The savory flavor of the pork is still on my mind. My girl went with 2 BBQ Pork tacos (really good!) and the Bi Bim Bop (good as well), which came in a nice sized portion. I also tried the Spicy Shrimp Taco and it was just as goodThis place has a chill/cool vibe to it as it plays some nice hip hop (Tribe Called Quest/Kanye West/Gang Starr/Fugees/The Roots/etc...)while you eat. You can call in your order or have delivered. Again, since this so close to me this place will be where I get my winter comfort food from."
"Ok...I don't think it beats Kogi.  Of course, a side-by-side comparison is impossible, but I just recall really being impressed with the veggies on the Kogi taco, and not experiencing that at Del Seoul.All right, now that the nit-pickiness is out of the way...I really do like Del Seoul, and not just because it has the best name ever for a Mexican/Korean place.  The best there was, the best there is, and the best name there ever will be.It's as close to Kogi as we'll get, and that's not a bad thing at all.  I like their tacos, but I think their bahn-mis are where they shine (so really...it's Vietnamese/Korean fusion?).  And those kimchi pork belly fries (uhh...French/Korean?) are really tasty and filling.Of course, if you order like a boss, you get a banh mi and some tacos and some fries.  Damn you DS for increasing my desire to move to Lincoln Park, just so I can get a kalbi taco, a Spam musubi from Aloha Eats, and a cupcake from Molly's in the same day.  Every day.  For the rest of my life."
"Having gone through almost the entire menu just out of curiosity, I would very much recommend this place. The tacos are delicious, especially the shrimp tacos. But what this place is really, really great for is the kimchi fries. They have the most delicious seasoning, kimchi, sour cream, leeks and cheddar cheese (not that nasty powdered stuff you sometimes get, but the real thing).The only thing I didn't really enjoy was the soup with various seafood and tofu. It was strangely spiced and the tofu was just in lumps. Not very good. To be fair to the chef(s), I did have a severe cold when I ordered it so it's possible that the tofu was just going to be a little bit icky that night no matter what...But seriously, go for the kimchi fries and have some tacos on the side. Well worth it!"
their tacos are the bomb dot com.
"Good start, but not great.  I missed the soft openings due to it being marathon weekend and waitied until opening night to try it.  Maybe I built this place up too much.  I tried each taco and was a little disappointed.  The shrimp taco was bland and the kalbi taco was lacking.  The secret slaw and chili salsa, which at times is very good, masked the taste of the kalbi.  The bbq pork taco was my favorite by far.  It was the most flavorful out of all the tacos.  The gamja fries with garlic aioli sauce were pretty tasty.  I wish it was in a larger serving plate.  We demolished the plate as if it was the only thing we ordered.  I will definitely come back and try the banh mi as well as the dumplings, and then update my review accordingly.The staff is very friendly and obviously working hard with lots of opening business.  I'm glad there is another place besides Taco Chino to get my desperate and irrational Korean taco fix from, but I just wonder if it's as good as I recall from my trips out west.  I'm sure this place will do fine as the niche it serves is relatively free of competition here."
"recommendation: KALBI POUTINE! sooo good. honestly, i like the kalbi poutine MORE than their coveted kimchi fries. the kimchi juice makes the fries way too soggy in my opinion (the flavors are pretty awesome tho). the korean tacos are not bad as well."
"Went here for the second time this week.  Having heard of it from some people who work on Clark? They highly recommended it.  I has the shrimp tacos which were incredible.  Messy to eat, but full of flavor. Was very satisfied.  Second time I went I had the kalibi beef plate.  It was very good. Lots of flavor and the meat was cooked perfectly.  There kimchi is also very good. Being a huge fan of kimchi, it was very important to me that it was good.   Next time I go, I am looking forward to trying the kimchi fries."
"Pretty good food, a little on the expensive side, but I'd go back. I got the shrimp taco, the dumplings, and split an order of the pork belly fries. I thought the shrimp taco was really good. The shrimp, slaw, and corn tortilla went really well together. I also really liked the dumplings because they were savory and yummy, and the presentation on the steamer was cool. The pork belly fries were so-so. I liked the kimchi in them, but overall, I thought it was a bit heavy and weird, so I would not get them again. They do not have many tables, and I noticed several of them were occupied by people waiting for the rest of their party to show up. Because the space is small, this restaurant should institute a noodles & company-esque policy where you must order first before taking your seat. Otherwise, your food might be coming out and you're still standing waiting for a table to clear. I did not experience this, but I'm just sayin'. Overall, good dining experience."
"On my first trip to Del Seoul, my boyfriend and I sat down with shrimp and kalbi tacos and shared an order of kimchi fries. He'd been before and loved it, so he was interested to see how I'd like it. I think I bummed him out when he asked how the food was and I said, ""Eh, it's fine.""But, this was me after taking a test for about five hours, and so my brain was moving about as quickly as an old computer downloading a full-length movie on a dial-up connection. About twenty minutes later, while we were in the car, I suddenly said, ""Wow...those kalbi tacos were REALLY good! I mean...they were REALLY good. Wow. So good.""Needless to say, my boyfriend was relieved, though he laughed at my delayed reaction. I don't have exposure to Korean fusion beyond Del Seoul, so I can't say how this compares to the much-hyped Korean tacos of LA, but I can say that this place is comforting, delicious, and cheap. The staff is friendly and efficient. It can get crowded, so if you choose to eat in, be prepared to wait for a little bit. But the staff does a great job of holding your order until you are seated, and then the food appears shortly after and is still hot and tasty. I did try a BBQ plate my second time there, and it was respectable, but if you're going for the first time, I would recommend the shrimp or kalbi tacos and sharing an order of the kimchi fries. You might die when you eat the fries, but at least you'll die happy, they're so delicious. Overall, it's a great place to go to quickly and inexpensively satisfy a craving for Korean food."
"Korean Food...Me Likey.Mexican Food...Me Likey.'90s Hip-Hop...Me Likey.Urban Feel...Me Likey.Cheap...Me Likeyyy.So what do you get when you have korean tacos set in an urban-inspired asian fast casual joint that's soundtrack is old-school hip hop all for under $10 a person?Pretty Good.Pretttyyy Good.Not OMFGWTFKBBQ! (the k is for korean)Just, prettyyyyyyy goood.Will be returning.Especially to try the pork belly and kimchi fries.Because it is not a secret that me likey pork belly.So, Overallll......Me Likey."
Why in the WORLD did I wait so long to get here? Those sesame-chili shrimp tacos? Those handmade pork dumplings? Those seasoned gamja fries?Do they make a bad dish here?Are you sick of me asking rhetorical questions?You are?Well then stop reading this review and simply heed its advice: Go to Del Seoul -- It lives up to all the hype!
"So I decided this place is definitely deserving of 5 stars...I'm am thoroughly addicted.  The shrimp and kalbi tacos are now my crack...I can't go too long without them or I get very unhappy.  I also tried their shrimp sandwich (Banh Mi) today-awesome!  I'm still partial to the tacos, but anything with their ginormous, yummy shrimp on it is to die for, breaded and dripping with their sesame-chili aioli....yummmmm!"
"I came here for a soft opening last night and think I am still full. They started us with chicken tacos, then bibimbap, then pork banh mi, then a chili shrimp banh mi. Everything was awesome (my only suggestion was that they not bread the shrimp, it became too bready). Everyone seemed friendly and they were actually reading our comment cards. Bonus point right there.I can't wait to go back once it has the regular opening and try the pork belly kimchi fries (but someone has to go with me to share). Hopefully a great new addition to the hood."
"Both the Korean BBQ Tacos and the Banh Mi sandwiches are excellent. I would highly recommend the Kalbi, Bulgogi and the Sesame-Chili Shrimp from here. The chicken and pork are alright, but the beef and shrimp are that much better.Portion size is decent. Two to three tacos will satisfy most any appetite, and if a sandwich by itself isn't enough, the Seasoned Gamja Fries are awesome!Staff is very friendly, and they also have a small selection of Korean snacks and candies at the counter as well. I highly recommend trying it out."
"FAMOUS FOR:- Kalbi Taco (5/10)I ALSO TRIED:- Spicy BBQ Pork Taco (6/10)- Sesame-Chili Shrimp Taco (8/10)- Spicy BBQ Chicken Taco (2/10)- Bulgogi Plate (2/10)- Dolsut Bibimbop (4/10)- Kimchi Fries (3/10)- Seoul Style Street Dumplings (9/10)I FINALLY got to try Del Seoul! Before I get to any of the food, though, I just have to say, whoever came up with the name ""Del Seoul"" is just abso-freaking-lutely genius! And if the name wasn't clever enough, the logo is perfect too! I don't know if there can be a better name to describe Korean/Mexican fusion! Speaking of fusion, don't get your hopes up if you think there's anything Mexican here other than the corn tortilla. That's where it pretty much ends, and if you get anything other than tacos, it's just straight up Korean (or the Bahn Mis which are Vietnamese/Korean).I don't know what the place looked like before remodeling, but I like the layout now. They've got a pretty decent number of tables, but I imagine that this place could be a zoo during rush hour. Line builds really quickly, and this ain't no Kogi truck, so even just tacos take some time to come out. Enough time for you to get your drink, claim a table, go to the bathroom, and have a short conversation with your friends about how awful the traffic was to get to Del Seoul.TACOSOrder of best to worst:1) Sesame-Chili Shrimp2) Spicy BBQ Pork3) Kalbi4) Spicy BBQ ChickenA quick thing about me and tortillas. I feel that in a taco or burrito, you have 2 conflicting forces, the meat & contents vs. the tortilla. Don't get me wrong, I like tortillas (corn, not flower), but I feel like they work against each other most of the time. The more potent the meat flavor is vs the tortilla, the better a taco tastes. So in Del Seoul's case, the meat is losing!The BBQ Pork is slightly more flavorful than the Kalbi. If you have the meats by themselves, they're decent, but not great. BBQ Pork is usually saltier and garlicky. I don't know if the tastes were tuned down a notch for the sake of more American tongues, but having a Korean tongue, I wasn't all that impressed. Also add to the fact that the tortillas were taking away from the flavor, and you have a just-ok taco. However, add Sriracha sauce, and now you're talking something nice and flavorful. My problem is Srirach should enhance the flavor, not carry it. If there's any kimchi in the slaw, I couldn't taste it. Chicken's not worth mentioning. The shrimp is actually fried nuggets of shrimp. 2 of them fit in 1 taco. Now this actually had a good flavor to it. Very unique. In this situation, the Sriracha actually enhanced it. The shrimp was tender, and had a nice sweet/salty taste to it, and it actually wasn't robbed that much by the tortilla either. I'd definitely get a bunch of these next time.DUMPLINGSKorean steamed Mandu. These were really good. I haven't had mando this good since I last went to Korea! Packed with flavor, and a dip in Soy Sauce, and it's heaven! Get about 8 for $6.BIBIMBOPStandard stuff, but you know, the bulgogi is really lacking flavor, so the whole bowl suffers. I guess if you add extra kochujang (chili sauce), it'll help. BULGOGIThese pieces are actually 2 or 3x as thick as I normally have Bulgogi. But the common thing here is that it is devoid of flavor. I think they just need to season it more. Looks good, but I'd never order it again.KIMCHI FRIESI dunno why I keep getting these. It's just fries, topped with melted cheese and kimchi-esque stuff. Not that great. Hardly any kimchi flavor. I tried their kimchi (and everybody has different preferences of fermentation level) is on the newer side, so it doesn't pack a lot of taste, which could be why I can't taste the tiny pieces on tacos.BOTTOM LINEI'd get dumplings and 2 shrimp tacos and call it a day. That's like $12! I think if I can substitute my mom's kalbi marinade and more fermented kimchi, I think this would be a winning combo, but for the sake of business, I guess I'm the minority. Everyone else seems to like it just the way it is."
"The only negative about Del Soul is they are not open late. It would be the best place to eat after a night of drinking and dancing. There are a lot of Asian food options in the area, but this one is truly unique and stands out.I went on a Saturday night and the place was packed but not overly loud which was nice. The place is kind of small, so i could see a long wait for a table on a busy night. Luckily we got a table right away.This was the second time i have tried Korean tacos. They were different then the ones i had at the Korean BBQ Taco Truck in Orlando, but just as good. I ended up ordering a shrimp, a kalbi  (steak) and a pork Taco. The pork was probably my favorite out of all of thme. The meat was nice, tender and the flavors melded really nicely together.  note: The taco's are kind of small, so you will probably need to order more then one.I also had a side of dumplings, which were really good too. Be careful with the dumplings they take a while to cool down to an edible temperature. I learned that one the hard way.The service was really nice and friendly. You have to order at the counter, but the staff will help you find a seat and bring the food to you. All in all it was a good experience and i can't want to go back. Next time i think i might try one of the meat plates. All of the food looked and tasted fresh. You can tell it is all made to order."
"I always get the fish and shrimp tacos with an order of kimchi fries to split with a friend (about $4/taco, btw).   The tacos *are* pretty small, but two orders of tacos and a plate of fries to split with another person is usually more than enough to get me full.  I will say, though, that I'm not a huge fan of the fries (they're honestly not that special and you're probably better off just ordering another taco).  Plus, if you're a vegetarian, you should just stay away from it altogether since it contains pork.  The seasoned gamja fries are pretty much the same thing only with a side dip of the sour cream without the kimchi and pork piled on top.  The galbi tacos are also really great. Haven't tried much of anything else on the menu, but as far as Korean-fusion places go, I'd say this is probably one of my favorite go-to places. Seating is limited, since it's usually packed, so prepare for that."
"Been meaning to come by and try this place after hearing good things.  A group of friends were headed there and even though I already ate a big dinner, I still went to give it a try.  I guess I can get a taco and see what it's like right?We got there and I ended up eating a Kalbi Taco, some Kimchi fries, taste of the Dol Sot and dumplings!  Yes it was lots of food.  Yes it was all pretty good.  And yes I'd go back for more!  Kalbi was tender and tasted pretty authentic.  Instead of Ssam it was eaten with a corn tortilla.  The dol sot bibimbop was like how mom makes it...  Kimchi fries was a little scary, but once you dive in you can't stop eating em.Time to go back and eat some other stuff."
So good! My first visit was yesterday and I was back again today! The new poutine fries are amazing! The food is fresh and full of flavor! Service was excellent. I can't wait to go back again!
"I have been on an insane korean kick lately.   I blame it on the gochujang sauce.   So I decided  Del Seoul was the next to check off the list.   We had - the shrimp taco, dumplings, the bibimbop in the hot stone bowl and kimchi fries.   The kimchi fries were not my favorite but everything else was delicious.   The hot stone bowl makes the bibimbop soooo good and really takes it up a notch.   The shrimp taco was very good, but very small.    My only complaint would be the portion size for some dishes.   The fries were small as were the tacos."
Deliciousness!  Everything on the menu is great.  The shrimp tacos and the bento boxes are my favorites.
"First night as a Chicago local made me venture to this Korean fusion joint of sorts on Wrightwood and Clark in Lincoln Park.I read the reviews recommending the Kalbi BBQ platter and the dumplings. That is what I ended up purchasing and enjoying VERY much.Granted, this place doesn't serve the most AUTHENTIC Korean BBQ I've ever had but pretty damn good and really worth it for the value. They serve a ton of beef, rice, bok choy, and onions that it is a steal almost.I would definitely come back to Del Seoul if I was looking for an Asian fix on a budget. Consider checking out Del Seoul if you're in the area.I almost forgot to mention that the service was very quick and the place was packed on a Friday night. They also play pretty good music and are very friendly."
"I love shrimp tacos. The shrimp tacos here are deeeeeeeelicious, hence the five stars! Best shrimp tacos I've had in Chicago.The pork and bulgogi tacos and the dumplings were good, but did I mention the shrimp tacos?! Eat them!"
loved the veggie bi bim bop and steamed dumplings! Quick service and great flavor
"Del Seoul is amazing, and I'm Korean so I know good Korean fusion when I experience one. You HAVE TO eat the chili shrimp taco.  It's probably my favorite taco I had while I was there.  I also tried the kogi beef one and that taco was good as well.  I had taken a glimpse of the tables next to us and I had seen someone eating bibimbap (mix of sauteed veggies, meat and rice) and it looked sooo good, and they way she was devouring it down, I take it that it tasted good as well lol.Next time I'm in Chicago, I'm stopping by here again."
"Del Seoul deserves the hype that is has come with - unfortunately, I think long lines are heading their way soon. For a small restaurant with seating for about 20 on a crowded corner, thats not a great thing.As far as the food, go to the banh mi. Bread is soft and crip, meat is juicy and tender, vegetables are fresh and add a spice and texture, and the aioli binds it all together. Yum!Other fave were the dumplings. For the price, you get 8 (maybe 10?) dumplings. The dough was fresh and homemade (or at least I think!) and had a great bite to it. It looked rustic and I felt like there was great care taken to make these dumplings. Its a 100 year-old recipe, and now I know why. Great presentation too!The one thing I wouldnt get again, at least immediately, would be the Korean BBQ chicken taco. My chicken was fatty but I think it was just luck of the draw. I would try other tacos first!And cant forget their ability to use social media to connect to their customer. Love it!"
KIMCHI SAN GYUP SSAL CHEESE FRENCH FRIES?!?!the end. i lied. not the end.THEY HAVE MILKIS?!?!?!now the end.
"Kimchi Fries, Sesame shrimp tacos, korean short rib taco, fish tacos...yummmMessy yummy food. Lots of toppings on the taco and very tasty. Also had the spicy tofu soup and bim bim bop. They were alright. If you are looking for authentic Korean food then it is only average and sub par compared to Toronto. (we went with someone from Korea as well). If you want to try something Fusion then those tacos are awesome, even the Korean agreed.Highlight of my Chi-town trip in terms of food"
The Kalbi fries were the best!
This is AWESOME! Their bul-go-gee bahn mi sandwich is amazing. (What an amazing combination!) And they have the best kimchee. I bought a jar to bring home because it is so good!I had their miso soup too which was delicious as well.Great place to have lunch!
"When I first heard of the Kimchi Pork Belly Fries, I knew I had to try them.  It just sounded epic: kimchi (food of the motherland), pork belly (always a good thing), on top of some cheese and fries.  The fries were good, but the rest disappointed me.  It was good, but I guess I was hoping for more.  It would've been better if there were bigger pieces of pork belly, rather then the little bits.  It was just okay.  The kalbi & spicy pork tacos were solid.  The flavors were really great and I really liked the slaw on top.  I also tried the Street Dumplings, which were good.The service was friendly and we had no problems finding a seat on a weeknight.  I thought the prices were reasonable and overall I enjoyed my meal."
"The newly expanded Del Seoul taco joint was my family's destination after a 5K run we did together at the Lincoln Park Zoo.   We must have looked famished and needy, hanging outside their door 15 minutes before their official opening time, because they took pity on us and let us in to peruse the menu until they were ready for us-- for that we were grateful!I had heard rave reviews of the shrimp tacos in particular, but for me, the Sambal Fish taco was the standout.  It was one large fried flaky fish filet, wrapped in a flour tortilla and garnished with spicy sauce (looks like a combo of mayonnaise and sriracha), pickled onions and cabbage.  The fish was fresh and the pickled onion flavor was a nice addition, and although I'm not a big fan of flour tortillas, this was a good combination.We also ordered the hot stone bibimbop and the kimchee fries.  The bibimbop was pretty standard, nothing out of the ordinary really.  I was disappointed by the kimchee fries, which had hardly any kimchee or pork belly.  At $7, it was not worth the money.  I ended up dousing the container with sriracha sauce to get the spice I was looking for.  For a post-race treat, it hit the spot, I'll be back for the fish!"
"Del Seoul has done their prep work.  Barely into their first month and the kitchen is on point.  Traffic is at a constant with a line almost out the door. And for good reason.  Bibimbop, Korean BBQ Tacos, and Viet Sandwiches with several meat selections.  But regardless what you order, you have to sample the Kimchi and Pork Belly Fries!  Who doesnt love french fries?  Pork belly, cheddar, jack, sour cream, Kimchi, scallions, onions...awesome.  Kimchi isnt exactly for the novice korean foodie.  This may or may not be a good intro into the world of korean style pickled Napa.  Obviously, being a young new restaurant, several changes will occur.  Price points and menu selections will be adjusted..as is already reflected in the current menu.  Cant wait till they come up with a specials menu..maybe seasonal soups? YooKeeJong *wink*Keep up the awesome!"
The tacos are seriously like crack. The chili shrimp ones are the best! Great steamed potstickers and kimchi as well. You really can't go wrong with anything here :)
"We definitely had soul at Del Seoul!! Loved this place! From the super fast service, very nice staff to the exceptionally yummy food. We got the pork and veggie dumplings that were very authentic and delish, but they could have given us a little more soy sauce to share. Then onto the tacos, get the tacos when you come here! As everyone says the chili shrimp taco was the best, i had to come back and get a second one just to savor all the flavor from the lettuce, nuts, sesame seeds, and that special sauce!! Oh and the kalbi taco was also full of flavor. My hubby said that his bbq chicken taco was just okay so definitely go for the shrimp and the kalbi! Will def. be back when I'm in the area, and the fact that they expanded meant no wait! Love that aspect! we sat by the window, ate our kalbi tacos and people watched! Definitely a fan!"
I had the one of the best tacos I've ever had in my life here. It was a shrimp taco and i usually don't go gaga over shrimp. It was very memorable. I've been trying to make an excuse to come back ever since to try some other things.
"My birthday dinner request was to go to Del Seoul. So many of my facebook friends have been here and have nothing but good things to say.  We had the Kalbi, shrimp and pork tacos, dumplings and my daughter had the kids meal w/ Beef. The kalbi was amazing and favorful. My daughter's kids meal had a very small portion of beef on the side which she plowed through easily. Luckily i was able to buy extra beef for $2.17  The dumplings was not as flavorful even after dipping in soy sauce.  But all in all - it was a great place and very happy we went. See you soon Del Seoul!"
"This place has it going on! We had the sesame chili Shrimp tacos, so good i could have downed two more. Also tried the Spicy BBQ Pork and it was grrrreat. The rice is nice and sticky so it is easy to eat with chopsticks. I especially liked the bit that comes into contact with the sizzling hot plate. The pork was nice and spicy and the bok choy was so good that I couldnt wait for it to cool down before I downed my share. Yum!"
"finally came here for the first time. sooo good.tried the fish taco, sesame-chili shrimp taco, and kalbi taco. all were really good. and kimchi fries! GENIUS.bulgogi rice plate is good too, but you can get that at any other korean place.atmosphere and service is good too."
"Really liked the food here. Had the chicken wings and shrimp tacos and fries! Really liked the fries and tacos, chicken was not bad but not the best thing to get on the menu :)"
"Stop reading right now.Grab your keys, wallet and cell phone.Leave your house, go to Del Seoul and eat.This place is absurdly good."
"Hands down my favorite meal in recent history!! So.much.flavor! My husband and I really outdid ourselves here BC we wanted to try more and more- favs were the shrimp taco & the spicy BBQ pork Banh Mi sandwhich. The food came out quick, but hot and fresh. The staff was courteous, in top of their game and reserved judgement when we ordered more... Seemed like they were pretty strict on their early(ish) close time- so get there before 9pm. Feel sure this wld be in weekly rotation if I lived in the area! So delicious!"
solid korean food still. love the tacos and the dumplings are a nice side. Might not be the cheapest way to eat a lot of food. Good times.
"This restaurant is going to be great and I can't wait until they open so I can try the other items.  The creations that we tried during the sneak preview last night were amazing!  I believe that there really aren't any Korean options in the area, except for Crisp, which is a few blocks north on Broadway, so Del Seoul will be a wonderful addition to the diverse food options on Clark. I think that the pork bahn-mi was my favorite...warm toasty bread, fresh vegetables, flavorful Korean BBQ pork...it was an awesome Korean version of the Vietnamese bahn-mi.  The kimchi and pork belly fries caught me by surprise....it was my second favorite.  I really didn't know what to expect, but it was amazing!  The combination of carmelized kimchi and onions, cheddar and jack cheese, sour cream, and pork belly tasted so right over fries!  Who knew?!!  The seasoning sprinkled over it made it taste even better.The kalbi and Korean BBQ tacos were a very clever Asian version of the traditional tacos we're used to.....fresh greens and well-marinated meat with some Asian flare....It was delicious!By the time I had a chance to eat the bibimbap, I was stuffed!  I was only able to take in a couple spoonfuls and it wasn't bad.  The ingredients were fresh.I can't wait until my next visit, I already know what to get.....pork bahn-mi and kimchi and pork belly fries....and then some!"
"One of my favorite go to spots in LP.  Expanding the restaurant space was probably the best thing that happened at Del Seoul.  Be warned though, this place is very unpredictable and can fill up pretty quickly.  I tend to order my food to go. My favorite thing to order is their kalbi tacos along with the kimchi pork belly fries.  The kalbi bursts with flavor and the crunchy spicy lettuce and sesame seeds complement the taco perfectly.  And the kimchi pork belly fries? You just have to experience them yourself to know their amazingness. Because their tacos are usually wrapped with two shells and packed with stuffing, I tend to make two tacos out of one order.  That way, I get double the goodness and I get to enjoy my meal a little longer."
"My absolute favorite lunch spot! You must try their various tacos, they are superb. There are many other places that try to imitate and claim to be Korean BBQ, but Del Seoul is the best by far!"
"Always a line but it moves fairly quick. Got the pork, short rib, and chicken tacos. The short ribs was by far the best. The pork was the next and the chicken last.(chicken is still delicious)My friend got the bimbop and fries. Bimbop was pretty typical, but the fries sauce was delish.  The fries have a tangy, spicy white sauce on the side. So GOOD! My recommendation. Short rib taco. Enjoy it!"
"Everything I've tasted from the place is good.- Dat Kimchee. AND THEY SELL THEM IN JARS? WHAT? automatic 54935 stars.- Gamja Fries are better than Kimchee Fries though. I wish the world revolved around me so I can eat them every day. The sauce that comes with them are fap worthy.- Kalbi is far more succulent than the Korean restaurant I work at. What the eff.- Miso hungry for miso soup.- Workers are fluent in Engrish. IMPOSSIBURU!!!Never dined in though, only take-out. I'll dine-in when I acquire friends."
"If you listen to nothing else I say please, for your sake and that of your dinning partners listen to me when I tell you the most important thing when eating at Del Seoul BRING GUM !!! Your gonna need it after these spicy/garlicy/oniony treats !oh and make sure you pick up napkins, utensils, and srirachi sauce before you head to your seat, they bring your food to your table when its ready but they do not bring these things, and you WILL need napkins !Taco's: I tried the Shirmp, short rib, and BBQ Chicken.  All are filled with meat, onion-cilantro relish, over flowing with their 'secret slaw', and dressed up with sesame seeds, yes by using the term overflowing I am trying to say they are messy little buggers !  - Shrimp was hands down my favorite, the shrimp were panko battered. The taco comes stuffed with soooo much 'secret slaw' (lettuce) that there was no way I could eat it with out making a huge mess. So I decided to split it up amongst the two corn tortilla's that all tacos come in, though to my dismay there were only two shrimp in each taco, yes they were large shrimp but still a bummer when your trying to make two tacos out of one ha !! The Shrimp tacos are the most expensive with the smallest portion of meat at $2.99- Chicken were just okay, I didn't really like the texture of the chicken.- Grilled beef short rib were my least favorite, again didn't like the texture of the meat.Fries -The seasoned gamja fries with garlic and sesame aoli were delicious, crisp fires, and aoli I could eat with a spoon... yummmmmmy... and at only $1.75 they are a great deal, especially if you split them, which you should !Soeul street dumplings -Were delicious but 8 pieces was just too many, I could do with a smaller serving like 2 for a dollar.I will definitely be back for another shrimp taco and to try the kimichi fries."
"So the kimchi tacos were on my bucket list before I left Chicago, and I'm so glad i went there.  It was fantastic! I really enjoyed all the food. I thought it was a great combination cause I love Korean food and my husband loves Mexican, so a restaurant that combines the two is a dream come true.Tried the pork, kalbi (beef short rib), chicken taco and had a bite of my husband's shrimp taco. I think they were all well seasoned and the kimchi topping on the tacos was not overpowering.  I enjoyed the shrimp bite, it was sweet, big pieces of hot shrimp and the panko coating was perfect.  The tortillas were warm and not too thick, great vehicle for carrying the tasty meat inside.  We also had the seasoned fries, it had small pieces of kimchi, pork, green onions, cheese and a mayo style dressing. Sounds like a hot mess, but it was a good combination. Yeah, I probably ate one taco too many but didn't want leave wondering about any of the tacos.  We took the kids and they enjoyed the kid menu, it's refreshing to have a kid menu that doesn't include chicken nuggets or mac n cheese.  The staff was very nice and seemed patient when one of the customer didn't know what to order. It will definitely be on my re-visit list!!"
"This place is great for a casual bite. The shrimp tacos are my favorite, although the fish are a close second. It is unfortunately not open late, but better for lunch anyways."
"This is one of my regular lunch spots. I do enjoy my Del Seoul day. Dumplings and bulgogi are both good. The taco's are friggin' awesome. After eating here many times I have come to the conclusion that the shrimp tacos are the best, this is the reason I go. The kalbi tacos are also nice and seem to be a fan favorite. But man those shrimp? Yeah ya!"
"Great place. It has a casual fast-food vibe, it's hard to find a table and its sometimes messy, but the prices and food can't be beat.Get the shrimp taco. It comes with this awesome slaw on top of the shrimp that's an awesome combo of warm and soft and cold and crunchy. I brought my family here when they visited at their request to have something that they can only get ""in the big city"" and they were not disappointed!"
"Jumping on LA's Kogi truck newfound popularity, Del Seoul brings some tasty Korean flavored quick eats to Clark Street.  On a busy Saturday night, we grabbed take out tacos - filled with short ribs and shrimp.  The ribs fell a bit ""short"" for me, with the beef being a little tougher than I expected from a braised meat.  The panko covered shrimp were topped with a sweet sauce which complemented the savory taco.  Full flavors would bring me back to try some of the banh mi's one of these days."
"Yum Yum Yummy!!!!! The first time i had this was in the back seat of my friend's car when she shoved a to go container in my lap after i told her i was hungry. As i scarfed down two kalbi tacos I was hooked! I finally paid a visit to the actual restaurant and ordered a Kalbi taco and a shrimp taco. The Seasame-Chili Shrimp taco was good, but not great. The shrimp was delicious in itself, but when added to the taco, the breading, plus the taco shell slighlty overwhelmed the  taste and i felt like i was eating mostly flour. The Kalbi taco on the other hand was DELICIOUS!! I'm salivating just thinking about it. The fish taco is actually very good too. It tasted fresh and moist. And need i mention Kimchi fries?! I can't imagine what the place looked like before they expanded, but im glad they have more space to accomodate their growing clientele."
"Whoever rates this place high must not be rating real Korean food. And I guess I do not understand the Zagat rating. I dined here recently expecting traditional Korean food. I had the bibimbap as it is my preferred Korean dish and seemed to be the only one I could recognize closest to Korean in their menu. It was ok but nowhere near like what the Korean restaurants located uptown serve. I had high expectations because of Yelp's high ratings. But I have to dial down the scale since it was not what I expected. I am not much for fushioned Asian food so this did not work for me at all. If you are expecting traditional Korean food this is not the place to go. But if you are ok with fushioned Asian food... well, give it a try. To me, traditional Asian food be it Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, etc..... has no need to be fushioned because by itself they already exude in flavor if done correctly. The name of the restaurant should have given me a clue. If you really want to experience great, traditional Korean food where they serve you an array of side dishes (Banchan) as soon as you sit down, venture to Ban Po Jung or the many other Korean restaurants in the Foster and Lawrence (Uptown) area of town."
Taco + Korean BBQ = 5 StarsIts simple math. You wont be disappointed. Try the pickles and kimchi. Hurry.
"I tried the 3 tacos, beef, shrimp, and fish. The beef and shrimp were pretty good, but the fish was phenomenal. It reminded me of fish I had when I visited the West Coast. If you want only one taco and can't decide, get the fish."
"I've loved Del Seoul since it opened!  So glad to see it's been popular enough to expand since it's start as a tiny hole in the wall!  Best things on the menu: shrimp tacos, spicy tofu hotpot, and the kalbi plate!  If you're hungry the plates and hotpot are a great option but even getting 3 or 4 tacos can fill you up.  Kimchi and gamja fries are both delicious and so are the dumplings! So basically what I'm saying is you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Try it all and come back often.  There are far less people during the weekdays, that's when I try to go!  Maybe I'll see you there!"
"Finally, a place that reminds me of home!I'm originally from Los Angeles, and frequented Ktown and Kalbi Taco trucks when they were all the rage back home. This place really has the authentic korean bbq flavors down, and the prices are extremely reasonable. I have tried the Spicy BBQ and Bulgogi sandwich, along with the Bibimbop. The food could get a little spicy though, so for those less adventurous eaters (not any yelpers I would know...), be aware. I was pleasantly surprised at the portions of the food since it was very inexpensive, but the flavors were amazing. The bibimbop came with so many vegetables I felt that my mom would be proud of my nutritious meal. There could be a line/wait for seats here since the place is pretty small, but I would definitely recommend this place to anybody."
"I still dream of their hot stone bibimbop. Would go back in a heartbeat just for that!Rice, steak, grilled vegetables, and an egg are all served in a hot stone bowl. Your job is to add their amazing sauce, mix everything together, and consume.  Even the rice around the edges also gets crispy from the bowl. Phenomenal.Their staff is absolutely on point, very sweet, and helpful."
Love!  This place is so good.  I love the tacos.  The flavors just pop and taste so fresh.  I have been telling everybody about this place and I'm Looking forward to going back!!
"MMMMM LOVED IT. My friends and I called and got an order for pick up.The pork and shrimp tacos are so gooood, my mouth is watering as I type this. When you order one taco, it's actually two...there are two tortillas, you just split up the filling. 4 will definitely fill you up.$2.50 for one. AMAZING."
"As Kesha would say ""HOT & DANGEROUS!""I have been wanting to try this place since it opened and finally I made it!  I got take out for a group so we could have some variety.Here is the skinny, the place is cute but looks like a take out place.The menu is quite large....so I decided on steamed dumplings (SO YUMMY...its a must get), banh mi pork sandwich (I wasnt impressed...I wouldnt get again), bibimbop (YUMMY!  It was good but the rice seemed overcooked), and FINALLY for the TACOS.  We had shrimp & chicken.  So FREAKING GOOD.  I would definitely go back for the tacos and the dumplings....everything else was just ok.  Plus, it was spicy.  I love the spice...I eat fresh jalapenos daily so when I say it was hot, it was hot and I liked it!!!  WOOHOO....deliciouso.  Plus, its cheap!  I will be back for more korean tacos...NOM, NOM, NOM!!!!!"
"This is a gem of a restaurant that delivered high quality food that is prepared very well at a reasonable price.  It's hard to beat.All four of the tacos (yes, of course I tried all 4!) were delicious.  I didn't share a single bite with anyone, and there wast nothing left after I stuffed my face into them.  My only criticism would be in regards to the short rib beef, which tastes about the same as every other short rib beef I've had at a Korean restaurant - prepared the day before, and over-nighted in the fridge.  I'm fine with it, but one day I'd like to be blown away.Service is friendly, space is great, price is right.  Winner, winner, Korean Taco Dinner."
"Finally, Korean BBQ tacos come to Chicago.  The kalbi tacos and shrimp tacos are really good.  The slaw on top makes the tacos extra tasty and crunchy.  The steam dumplings are well made, but really they don't stand up as well next to the flavorful tacos and fries."
"Thank goodness this place isn't in my neighborhood because I'd eat here everyday.  On your first visit the menu is a little overwhelming.  Get the tacos.  The shrimp taco is amazing.  Really.  My only complaint, they don't serve alcohol and it's not BYOB...if it were, it'd be the perfect place for a casual date."
"I went here last night with a friend, and it was excellent.  I had the short rib and shrimp tacos, which were excellent.  My friend had the Korean barbeque plate, which he loved, and we shared the dumplings and kimchi fries.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the dumplings are fine, but nothing excitng, and the kimchi fries are definitely different from what I had imagined.  They're more like load baked potato fries -- the kimchi and pork belly is pretty much covered by the sour cream, green onions,  and melted cheese.  Not that they're bad, but for $7, I'm unlikely to get them again.The restaurant itself is small (but I've been in smaller!), but newly re-done and very nice.  Staff were efficient about wiping down the tables, bringing out food, and directing customers to the condiments, silverware, etc.  I'll definitely be back here -- this is a perfect place to swing by for some take-out tacos on the way home from work."
"Any kind of ""asian fusion"" is like a ""DON't EAT HERE"" sign for me, but this place got it right! They fuse Korean food with viet (bahn mi) & mexican (tacos).I finally gave in and tried this place after my sister raving bout it. I tried their shrimp taco and kalbi taco along with their fries. DEE-Lish-shush.The kalbi in the taco was delicious and chewable (if that makes sense). The shrimp taco wasn't wimpy lil' baby shrimps. They actually put two big bouncy shrimps on it and it is AWESOME. Sweet and has a lil bit of kick to it. Awesome balance. The fries are regular fries but the sauce they give you to dip in is simple, yet so right. It's like a creamy, garlicky dipping sauce with green onion and sesame mixed in. My bf ordered the bulgogi sandwich....also deelicious. It was pretty massive and the meat was marinated beautifully. Not overly sweet and tasted so fracken good when you get a bite of everything together.I definitely would come back! Prices are reasonable too! :D"
"My friend and I drove all the way out to North Clark from the south side of Chicago, so that I can try Del Seoul's amazing Korean Tacos and their Pork Belly French Fries.We did a pick-up order, bc we had no time to find parking and dine in. The food was ready to go when I got there, and the people working there seem very friendly and nice, they even gave me coupons which I found to be incredibly awesome!When we finally were able to sit down and eat the food, we were very happy with the dishes. My husband really liked their Kimchi Pork Belly fries. I order the Bimbinbop, which was really tasty, and I thought the rice and everything was done to top knotch quality."
"This place is right in our neighborhood - so we usually place orders to 'carry out'.  From my understanding, this place is not BYOB (have heard mixed comments on that).Big fan of the shrimp and pork tacos, as well as the Shrimp Bahn mi sammy.  The Kalbi taco is hit or miss, every now and then the meat is really chewy which turns me off."
"I LOVE Del Seoul. Every time I come here, I leave with a full belly and a smile on my face.The tacos are stuffed full of delicious meat and slaw. These tacos are substantial, and 2 of them constitutes a meal. My favorites are the kalbi and the BBQ chicken. Drizzle some sriracha on top, stock up on napkins, and enjoy the deliciousness.No meal is complete without ordering a side of fries. The kimchi and pork belly fries are obviously amazing. Fries, kimchi, pork belly, cheese and onions? What's not to like? Be advised that they are huge, so you might want to bring a friend. Or just eat cheese fries for your dinner. No judgment. I also enjoy the regular seasoned fries with the garlic sesame aioli. The aioli is EFFING DELICIOUS! I can neither confirm nor deny that I have eaten scoops of it with my finger after running out of fries. (Pro tip: Get a side of the aioli with the kimchi fries for a truly spectacular culinary experience.)Del Seoul is a good place to get a great meal on the cheap. I highly recommend it!"
"Umm... this place is FIYYAAAA! But seriously- try the seasoned gamja fries.. they come with this sauce that tastes like it was created by Zeus soo... eat them? Also, fish taco is to die for, I crave them weekly."
"Food is pretty good.  Shorty on seating so be prepared to wait for seat or take it to go.I would have given 4 stars but something is off with the service.  It's not bad, its just weird.  I just get the feeling that no one really knows what is going on, but some how it works."
"Despite Karen T's proclamation, this place is BYOB.  Just last week I brought my flask filled with rum and got hammered.  I paid for a soda cup and made Cap'n and Cokes for two hours.  Menu is kind of pricey for what it is, however, the ingredients and overall dishes are of high quality so you get what you pay for."
"we tried almost everything here, and all I can say is ""amazing!!!""I am a picky korean eater, and I was very skeptical about Korean fusion restaurant, but this one will blow your mind. Except Taco and Kimchi fries, most of food here is very Korean (not fusion), and THEY ARE GOOD."
"Del Seoul is my ""visit"" to LA when I can't go on vacation. They offer Korean flavored tacos, which are very popular in LA! I'm glad this trend has started to make it's way here to Chicago! The food is really good, especially the tacos! However, I do consider it a bit pricey per taco (they are mini-sized!) but would be a great snack nonetheless. The kimchi fries were also good, but I wish the flavors were a bit more integrated instead of just putting kimchi bits over fries. But, I'm still very happy that I can at least get this food here in Chicago! :)"
"This place gets an extra star for being innovative with the fushion of korean, viet, and mexican cuisine.  The idea is great and I was nothing short of ecstatic when I heard about this place.  Combining three of the most popular (also my favorite from each) items from 3 separate types of cuisines.  Tacos, Korean BBQ, and Viet Sandwiches.  The next step would probably be a fushion of kimchi and Pho.  But that's just stretching it.  As far as the food, it peaked at mediocre with most of it being a result of tasting something new.  The idea was creative, but executed terribly.  A lot had to do with the restaurant's confusion of how they want to serve the food versus maintaining customer satisfaction.  A lot of the food tasted like it was sitting in the kitchen (having been prepared hours ago) and was just waiting to be put in a tray to be served.  None of the food came out hot and only the Kim Chi fries came out at an appropriate temperature ready for serving.  We ordered the tacos, the banh mi sandwich, kim chi fries, and dumplings.  All were good, but could have been a lot better.  There is a lot of potential for this place, but my first experience there did not warrant a second visit."
"Great concept.I tried each taco (kalbi, spicy shrimp, spicy pork, and spicy chicken) and the kimchi fries. I was most excited about the fries because they looked good and i've heard good things. I personally thought the fries just tasted like cheese fries with a hint of kimchi. There wasn't too much kimchi and the kimchi I ate were pretty bland.The tacos were good. I liked the spicy pork and spicy chicken. It was pretty filling for the size of the tacos. It wasn't spicy at all. I thought that adding siracha made it more flavorful.I had high expectations so I'm not too thrilled about the experience; Although, it was filling, cheap, and interesting."
"This place is the entire reason that I now have regular cravings for shrimp tacos.  The mysterious sauce they put in them is just so good!I also enjoy the Kalbi beef plate.Still not a fan of the kimchi.  I try a tiny bite of it every time, but just can't get used to the taste.  It's not them though; it's me."
"Look go here. Ok just go here and order some of the best tacos you could ever imagine. I've been stuck trying make a joke and incorporate the word soul, l but I'm lost. I cannot stop thinking about anything other than that crispy perfectly fried fish taco I had. Did I mention I like fried fish? No sorry LOVE fried fish, and I love a place makes a mean fish taco. I ordered the sesame chili shrimp, the fish taco and the kalbi. All of it was very delicious. This place lives up to the hype."
"It's hard to bring myself to write this review because I reside in MD and I know that writing about the Sesame-Chili Shrimp tacos here will give me a craving that I need a plane ticket to satisfy.  Sigh.Suffice it to say that their shrimp tacos will rock your world.  You can't really go wrong with panko-breaded shrimp on it's own, but after adding the slaw, the sesame-chili aioli, a little onion relish, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds and it becomes one of those so-good-you-don't-even-offer-to-share kinds of morsels.Case in point:  I have a very good friend who has seafood allergies.  Consequently, her s.o. generally refrains from ordering seafood anything when they eat out--they usually share + he's a considerate guy.  However, when they go here, he orders the shrimp tacos, uncharacteristically raves about how amazing they are, and goes on to tell her he wouldn't even share if she wasn't allergic to them in the first place.  :)I guess it's one thing to have an idea that something's good but never have the chance to find out what you're missing and another, to know exactly how awesome something is that you're missing and not have the opportunity to get it... I don't know which is worse.At any rate, for those of you who are fortunate enough to live nearby, I'd say they're worth the $2.95 that a few others are finding to be overpriced.  It's not a whole lot of food, but it's still close in price to a more substantial Crunchwrap from Taco Bell; and I would take the shrimp tacos over the Crunchwrap for the quality... and I even like Crunchwraps. + I think the cost is pretty negligible when thinking of how high the cost of living is in Chi anyway.I would probably give this place 5 stars, but I'd think it'd be unhelpful if I gave a perfect score when the only item I've tried is this taco.  Tip:  If you're carrying your taco order out, double check that they gave you the right taco--especially if it's busy.  When I was there, I received my order and walked out when I noticed that they had given me a bbq pork taco.  Set on trying out the hyped-up shrimp taco, I took it back and the person at the counter amended my order, apologizing for the switch.  There were no hassles besides needing to pull out the receipt for the order and walking back to the store, but it would have been pretty disappointing if I hadn't checked my order/gotten too far."
"This is some damn good stuff. Plain and simple. Obviously there's been lots of raves about here and its for a good reason. I stopped in here today soon after opening to get some tacos for lunch. I got a chili shrimp taco and two bbq chicken tacos and was ready to chow down. As I was eating I kept on noticing how quickly people were coming in here and within a half hour, there were about 10-12 people. That may not sound like a lot, but its not like this place is a massive cavern. Of course when I'd be starting to notice this, I'd then take a bit, and lots of flavors would be jumping out from between the small tortillas. In the words of Borat: I LIKE!Most of all, its all pretty inexpensive. I escaped here with three tacos and a drink for under $10. Everything was nice and quick and the tacos were damn good. This very fast for me will become a habit, and I can deal with this habit"
"Went on a Saturday night and got rock star parking right in front! For some reason I expected the place to be a little bigger. Seating was premium but luckily a couple was just about to leave right after we placed our order.We ordered one of each kind of taco (kalbi, pork, chicken, and shrimp), the dumplings, and the pork belly kimchi fries.Within 2 minutes of us sitting down and getting situated our food started to come out---I know, I know,I should be happy because we didn't have to wait long---but because it was so fast it had me wondering how much was already pre-prepared as opposed to being freshly made.The presentation on the tacos was very appetizing, the meats were all very well seasoned/flavored--so super tasty. Didn't care too much for the shrimp it was rubbery inside of it's slightly crisp flour coating.Take a pass on the dumplings---I'm in agreement with a few of the other fellow yelpers---they were of the fresh frozen variety that could be purchased at H-mart or other fine asian groceries. Let's just say you know it's bad if you can still taste them 2 hours later...The pork belly kimchi fries sounded a lot more interesting than what they really were---being that I went with a Korean person, she wasn't impressed-they were just ok-maybe if they were home-cut type of fries as opposed to the frozen seasoned fries that wold have helped?Definitely an interesting place to try. I like the concept and love the tacos but some of the sides just aren't necessary."
"I've been wanting to try this place ever since I heard a korean taco place was opening up in Lincoln Park.  My friends and I love making our own korean tacos at home and wanted to see their spin on it.  It's also a great location.We tried the kalbi taco, spicy pork taco, shrimp taco, bulgogi banh-mi, kimchi pork belly fries, and the dumplings.The kalbi was flavorful, but slightly overpowered by the pickled lettuce. A good topping that I was hoping they would have on the tacos was pickled radish (like what they have in bahn-mis).  I wished there was more cilantro in the taco, and the tortillas were either warmed up or even pan fried a little bit before serving.The spicy pork taco was just alright, but the shrimp taco was yummy, I definitely think the panko breading on the shrimp was a great idea.I liked the banh-mi as well -- they are much more generous with their meat than the vietnamese places.  Though I think the addition of onions was unecessary.The dumplings were just whatever, though they were better than most korean dumplings I've tasted (but also, I much prefer chinese dumplings over korean ones anyway.  I'm not a fan of vermicelli in dumplings, nor that typical taste in korean dumplings).  Also, I probably wouldn't pay for the dumplings here, since you can go to Senoya  (Del Seoul's owners' parents' restaurant), and get the same all-you-can-eat dumplings.Lastly, I kind of loved the kimchi pork belly fries.  It's like an asian version of carne asada fries. The combination of the ingredients is fantastic. My only complaint is that it was kinda lukewarm when served to us, and you know what happens to melted cheese when it's lukewarm.  Also $7 seems kinda pricey for the amount you get."
"Is it Korean?  Is it a taqueria?  No, it's Korean fusion BBQ!  Combine the succulent marinated meats from Korean BBQ with popular dishes like the Mexican Taco or the Vietnamese Banh Mi (sandwich) - that's what you get at Del Seoul.  I've loved Korean BBQ for years.  What's hard with Korean BBQ is that it's such a huge meal.  You leave the restaurant, looking like you're pregnant.  And your clothes and hair smell like burnt meat for the next week.  The neat thing with Del Seoul is that you get the BBQ goodness, but in small portions.  Just serve it like a taco, or stick it in a French baguette, and voila!  Yummy.  You can stop in for a snack, a lunchtime meal, or an informal dinner.  All under $10!  Del Seoul is not the first place to fuse Korean BBQ with the taco.  I think it came from Southern California?  On food trucks, too!  I'm glad they brought the craze to Chicago.  And they expanded by adding Vietnamese in the mix too, by putting kalbi or spicy pork in the Vietnamese Banh Mi.  Haven't seen banh mi with Korean food before, but it makes perfect sense.  I hope to see more and more creative combinations of great ethnic food from Del Seoul!"
Awesomeness in every bite! We tried each of the 5 tacos and while each was good the chile shrimp was the best. If you are seeking different toppings for different meats then this place is not for you. Seasoned Side fries with aioli were very good as well. Will be back here very soon and will try the dumplings. Seemed to be on a lot of tables. If Johnny T gives this place 5 stars you know it is worthwhile!!!
"Stopped in with the bf on this cold, cold Saturday. I wanted something piping hot so I ordered the spicy tofu hotpot, and he the bibimbop in a stone bowl. I also ordered a sesame-chili shrimp taco. The wait wasn't long (for how busy it was for a Saturday afternoon) and I received my taco first. I'm so glad I ordered the shrimp taco or else I probably wouldn't think of coming back here for a while.My spicy tofu was exactly what I wanted - piping hot! A little too much tofu for me, but if you like fishy, this is the dish for you. The kimchi was loaded with radish! I tried some of my boyfriend's bibimbop and you could taste the grill in the beef. Yum.Solid traditional dishes, but I know that Del Seoul is more popular for their tacos, bahn mi and kimchi fries, so I'm excited to come back to try more of their signature fusion fare."
"This place is awesome! I ordered a beef, chicken, and pork taco and all had a different flavor and texture. I opted out of the onion-cilantro relish but really enjoyed the coleslaw on the tacos. I also had the fries with aioli and was really pleased. Crispy, flavorful French fries with bold seasoning and a creamy aioli that resembled an Alabama White BBQ sauce. My daughter had a nice meal of beef, rice, and coleslaw. Prices are very reasonable at $3 a taco."
"Go out of my way to eat the delish tacos. Everything else is good and but you can get other places. Stick to the tacos, all of them #unlessyouallegictoshrimp, like I am.Fish taco get sauce on side. Great spot."
"Great eats and reasonably priced!  I've been following Del Seoul for a while and I couldn't wait to try the food here.  The hubs and I came on Black Friday and the place was already hopping around 11:30am.  I wanted to order one of everything off the menu.  It all looked so good!  In the end, I ordered the Bulgogi banh mi, the hubby got the spicy pork banh mi and kimchi pork belly fries.We got a cute two top table along the wall in the narrow hallway towards the bathroom.  Utensils and condiments were available for you to get at your leisure, along with napkins.  Our food came out hot and delicious.  I had to cut my sandwich in half!  The bulgogi was seasoned right, the daikon was crisp and I loved the slices of jalapeno peppers.  Add some sriracha and you're good to go.  The fries came out after we made a dent in the sammiches and they were amazing.  The fries were perfectly fried.  And why didn't anyone think of kimchi and pork belly on top fries before?!  All the flavors worked harmoniously, even though I would have preferred more pork belly.All in all, this was a great Friday lunch.  I can't wait to come back to try the Korean tacos.  Prices are ridiculous cheap for the amount of food you get.  I'm already plotting my next visit..."
"Eh... its a gimmick.  Korean infused tacos, etc.  I eat a lot of Korean and Mexican food.  This was not a good mix.Go here if you want to try a quick bite of something different.  I wouldn't go here for dinner unless if you normally eat fast food for dinner."
just more props to these mouthBangin peoples of da nomsholy shove it in my mouth hard and soft. these tacos nukcing ROCK!i won't give you details about the food as you can read the menu.but my toes curled. my boys got swoled and my pelvic area she waggled back and forth in a humping yo mama motion.its del Goods!
I ordered one shrimp taco and one fish taco and my whole world changed.  It was so good. Better then the highest yelped fish taco's in L.A. by far. can't wait to go back and try out the entire menu.
I've heard about this type of food before (having watched many a food network shows and read many food blogs) but until now I did not understand the power of the Mexican/Korean combo. Not since the chocolate/peanut butter combination has such an odd couple delighted my taste buds.I mean it just makes sense! Mexico and Korea. The 2 countries are even shaped slightly alike if you squint one eye and close the other and tilt your head to the right and use your imagination.I just wish there was a food truck for this place so I can enjoy them at lunch time on weekdays as well.
I usually hate shrimp...seeing poop lined on the back grossed me out. But let me just say once my friend had me try the shrimp tacos I was hooked. Its the only thing shrimp Ill eat. Its addicting as all hell and goddamn delicious...
"As promised, I came back on a late Saturday afternoon for my dine-in experience.  When I got there, I was surprised that most of the tables were occupied even during what I thought to be an off time between lunch and dinner.  Even as I guiltily ran to take the only empty table, which was a four seater and eventually scurried to a later vacated double seater, I thought the turn around for eat in diners was pretty decent.  Families, friends and couples seemed to eat, talk and enjoy themselves, but still clear out of Del Seoul without lingering too long.As previously vowed, I did in fact order a ""banh mi"" sandwich.  The French bread was perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft/chewy on the inside.  There were plenty of pickled strips of carrot and daikon.  The jalapeno did pack a wee little punch, but I kind of wished they hadn't sliced them so paper thin.  The shrimp tasted exactly like the shellfish from the taco I had the last time I ordered here.  I didn't count how many were in the sandwich, but there was plenty to fill my big, little belly.  My one little bone to pick with this sandwich is the fact that the shrimp sauce is not really a sauce.  In fact, it's a bit too watery.  How about some cornstarch or other thickener to glop it up, but not in a bad way?  The sandwich leaked of this liquid during my whole meal.  If I had traveled, it sure would've been a soggy mess by the time I unwrapped it.To pair with this sandwich I also grabbed a Sprite and the gamja fries with garlic aioli dip.  While I was happy to have Sprite as my clear cola/ginger ale substitute, I was somewhat confused about their choice of canned beverages.  I could be wrong, but I don't think Korean food is really synonymous with coconut juice, one of the few fruity cans I saw in their case.  Furthermore, the other choices were just not appealing.  Where are the cutesy drink choices that we East Asian chicks usually go for, huh?Another reason I was thankful for eating in was the gamja fries.  These fries arrived fresh, hot and crunchy from the deep fryer.  In fact, they were perfect.  While I have recently come to adore aioli, this version was simply mayonnaise with a heavy garlic flavor.  Essentially the dip was good, but not knock your socks off great.  Also from my internet searches, I assume gamja just refers to the slight spicing of the fries, but I felt like that could have been explained at least very briefly on the menu.  I guess I could have asked the cashier, but I can't stand when people ask a billion questions when there's a line forming behind them.Another cool thing about this place has to be the brother and sister tag team owners.  Even when busy, they still remember your name and what you ordered.  Also, kudos to the loud but not too blasting hip hop emphasizing the modern, cool vibe this place exudes. Del Seoul, I hope we can become friends.  See you again?"
Solid meal. Great street Korean.  Try the bulgogi bento box.
"Five stars for a taco joint. But not just any taco joint!We tried several things on the menu including soup, tacos, fries, and bahn mi.The tortillas on the tacos were super fresh, and the meats/shrimp were perfectly seasoned - topped off with delicious slaw. So good.The bread on the bahn mi was exactly as it should be for this sandwich - light, airy, and super crispy on the outside. So good.Everything we tried was SO GOOD. Makes it hard to want a Mexican taco after having these."
"Love everything here. .. the shrimp and kalbi tacos are enough to make me drive north and look for parking in this congested area!  The dumplings, the kimchi fries, the poutine.... all amazing!  Getting hungry just thinking about this place..."
"I'm new to the Korean BBQ world, but this place is so good! My stomach gurgled for two days after I ate at this place (sensitive GI tract) but I have no regrets. Nom."
I don't care if this isn't authentic and a bit pricey. I love the Kalbi Tacos & the Kim Chi Fries!!
"Order the whole menu, ..jk. shrimp tacos are my favorite. Fish tacos , kalbi tacos, are very good . Baun mi is good. Their fries are tasty. Yeah, just order the whole menu."
Absolutely one of the best little food spots in my neighborhood. All of the tacos are amazing. My personal fave is the Sesame-Chili Shrimp. I order the Kimchi fries every time. UH-MAZE-IN!
"This place is legit. Small family run establishment that has been booming since they opened... and for good reason. The service is fast and the food is delicious, bring Korean street food to Lincoln Park. Pure genius. My go to is the Sesame-Chili Shrimp Tacos and the Kalbi Tacos. These are so good, loaded with flavor. I didn't have the same complaint with the lack of shrimp, I didn't really even notice because they are loaded with flavorful relish and slaw. The sesame chili aioli should be illegal. Reasonably priced at $2.95, but I have a big appetite and can eat 3-4 of these.I think the Kimchi fries are a little excessive and over rated. For $7, I didn't like that the fries were soggy but the toppings were delicious on their own. My advice is to go with the seasoned Gmaja fries instead. At a fraction of the price, you don't get all the garnishes that you do with the Kimchi fries but the Garlic-Sesame Aioli is more like a truffle mayonnaise on crack. It is delicious... like unreal. Get a few extra on the side, they usually won't charge you if you are polite. You'll want to scrape the container clean with your finger, which is kind of disgusting now that I think about it. The Seoul Style Street Dumplings are BOMB. They're steamed to perfection and really juicy. So good, sometimes I stop in just for an order of these dumplings. $6.50 for an order of 8 is kind of pricy if you ask me, so I don't always indulge in this. Nice to share. Also, be warned that these usually take 10-15 minutes to prepare so order ahead. Another staple is the bibimbop. I'm not going to say I'm a Korean food expert, because I'm far from it... but this is a good meal. Generous portions of mushrooms and veggies with their kalbi and a poached egg over rice... you really can't go wrong. Overall, this place is a great Korean food spot in Lincoln Park, not sure on it's authenticity but who cares when you're getting delicious food."
"Sticking with my original 5 star review.  This was my third trip to Del Seoul and I still find the food to be delicious.  This time, I tried the pork tacos, which I would definitely have again.  Love love the pickles and yay for Coke Zero on the soda fountain.  Very friendly service, as well.  Good stuff - go have some!"
"I had been meaning to take a trip to Del Seoul, especially after all the hype, so I was happy when we were able to go this weekend.  We had the kalbi taco and the spicy pork taco. There was a good portion of meat on the tacos and the spices were nice and not overly spicy.  There was a good marinade on the vegetable toppings too. The meat for both tacos was very tender and service was fast.  My only complaint was that the meat was lukewarm and I am not a fan of cold temperature food. Prices were reasonable, about $2.50 each taco."
"The food is delicious, but everything else was a bit of a mess.  I went here with my friend to get some kalbi tacos and I decided to also try out their Korean fried chicken wings because they sounded delicious.  The kalbi tacos came out super quick, like 3 mins quick, and were delicious!  Then there was a 15 minute wait where I didn't get my chicken wings.  I saw the wings come out of the kitchen and got excited for them, until the waitress took them over to a table of four dudes and gave them to them.  I was sad they weren't mine, but I waited a little longer...as in 10 more minutes.  Finally my friend was well done with her meal and we needed to get home (it was like 10pm), so I went up to the register to ask for my money back because I never got my wings.  The cashier was very short with me as she rustled through the receipts to find my order - it's not like I did something wrong, so I didn't appreciate her treatment but did not engage her. Turns out the wings the waitress had taken to the dude table were MY wings, and the dudes had accepted them thinking someone at the table has ordered them or they were for free.  The dudes came up and explained that the wings weren't theirs, and the waitress asked if they had touched them (which they said no), but I was adamant that I did not want their wings after it had been on their table.  That was gross.  The manager/owner came out and I explained the situation as did the waitress.  The manager/owner looked pissed and apologized to me when I explained it had been 25 min with no wings.  He gave me my money back and insisted on giving me a to-go box of ""test"" wings he had been experimenting with on the flavoring.  I accepted and we headed out.  Turns out the test wings were delicious, a nice combination of crispiness, soy sauce flavoring, and sweetness.  Seriously, they were excellent.  But even if the wings had come out when they were supposed to, it would have been a 15 min wait for a place that is supposed to be ""fast food.""  I would definitely try this place again, but unfortunately they will need to be a little more on top of things before I give them 4-5 stars."
Two words: Kimchi Fries! Delicious.
"Bi Bim Bop was tasty, Korean short rib taco was delish.  The bad ass of it all.  The pork belly and kimchi fries.  I love pork, I love Kimchi.....the fries were the icing on the cake.  I wasn't even that hungry when I came in.  It's down the street from my apart, and even though there menu is currently a little small, I will be going back to try it all......P.S. Jarred Kimchi to go as well....."
"Del Seoul is right around the corner from my place, hence, I eat there quite frequently. While the tacos are solid, the real winner in my book is the kalbi BBQ plate. It might be the most expensive item on the menu, but the portions are generous and the flavor is worth it. I'd also recommend the dumplings (love the sauce).Also, pass on the kimchi fries...they sound much more interesting than they actually taste."
"I am definitely a fan.  I have been dying for Korean-Mexican food since trying the bulgogi tacos and kimchi quesadillas of the Kogi truck in LA, and so I jumped on the chance to try Del Seoul.  The tacos didn't disappoint, particularly the shrimp taco.  What a great combination of flavors -- the marinated meats perfectly complement the vegetables and corn tortillas.  The kimchi fries (fries topped with melted cheese, kimchi and small bits of pork belly) were solid as well.  The dumplings were OK, nothing special.  If it's any indication of my feelings for this place, I went back for dinner after eating here for lunch.  Now if only they had bulgogi burritos or kalbi quesadillas as well..."
"Short rib tacos. Pork dumplings.There isn't really very much to say about Del Seoul. There are a handful of korean taco shops in this town now (Tacorea?) but I really liked this one and would come here again. The dumplings are flavorful and tasty (even if they aren't fried potsticker style, which I sort of wish they were) and the kalbi tacos are super tender. That is about all I ask for in a korean taco restaurant. I did not try these legendary kimchi fries but apparently the fish taco is great.The only thing that would make this place better is actually having a truck. I know some people who would drive it."
"Del Seoul is a fast food Korean joint.  For what it is supposed to be, I think it does it well.  Don't expect to be blown away, but that being said, it is satisfying and fulfilling.First of all, I am Korean American and have been eating and cooking Korean all my life.  We had the kalbi tacos, bulgogi bahn mi, mandoo (dumplings), and kimchi fries.  The kalbi, bulgogi, kimchi, and mandoo were all well done and pretty authentic Korean.  It was really nice to have Korean food twisted with tacos and bahn mi.Also, the prices here are so reasonable.  I was shocked at how much food we got! I will definitely be returning."
"Very good Korean tacos?! The spicy pork tacos weren't that spicy, but they were very good.I also got the Spicy Tofu Hotpot. Also, not that spicy but good. My girlfriend got a couple of the sesame chili shrimp tacos and they were awesome as well.Wish the pork belly fries had more pork belly.Overall the food was good, but a bit pricey. $4.00 for a taco? Meh, I guess it's worth it."
"Very cool place. I only had the tacos and the Kimchi fries and a drink, and I think it was around $18-20. The Kimchi fries were good, but I would have preferred to save the money or spent it on another taco.Oh, about those tacos. Freaking awesome. And so cheap! You order them per taco, and they range from $2.75 - $3.95. I got two Sesame-Chili Shrimp and one Kalbi. Both were awesome, I honestly don't know which I liked better. I think I'd give the edge to the Kalbi, but it's close. And, I mean, $3 per taco, for ones this good, that's awesome. They're smaller than your Taco Bell tacos, but they're stuffed with awesome stuff. They don't skip on the protein included. I'd eat here every day if I lived in Chicago. I can't wait to go back."
"I've been here several times, and the food is pretty good! I've tried the tacos, but my favorite is the spicy pork banh mi b/c I just love sandwiches in general :) It's pretty good, especially w/ the pickled veggies & cilantro. Their kimchi fries are good, as well! Who knew putting kimchi, french fries, and pork could taste that great?! I didn't like their steamed dumplings which had too much of a ginger taste in it for me. Besides the fact that their sandwiches are a little pricey compared to their wallet friendly tacos, I'll go back once in a while when I want a banh mi fix or if I want a cupcake from Molly's! :)"
"Ohh my. I can't stop thinking about the shrimp tacos. The sauce is spectacular--and they way the shrimp is cooked ooo *mouth watering*. I've moved away from the LP area to the Sloop and crave these tacos. Best tacos I've yet to taste in the city, at least shrimp for sure!"
Kimchi fries are amazing!!!
Best Korean Taco spot in the city.  Get the Kalbi and Shrimp tacos and the dumplings (if you can handle more food).
i really like the tacos from this place. I think everyone should just order one of each and try all of the tacos. Did i mention the fries here are awesome? I really like the scallion and cheese on top. If i can go back to it then i will definitely try the hand made dumplings.
the tacos were amazing and good fries
Korean-ish Shrimp and chicken tacos and kimchi fries!  What's not to love?And a bottle of siracha for every table!? Perfect.Try this the morning after.  Clear that head right up.
My friend didnt' like this place at first. She said the dumplings were not good at all. I convinced her to come with me again and have the shrimp tacos. Well we each had a shrimp and fish taco and they were delicious. The fish was a little too big for the tortilla tho.
"On a recent visit to see family in Chicago, my husband and I stopped into Del Seoul. We used to live in California where they have great Korean street food, but MD is kind of lacking in that area. So, we were excited to find this place.We ended up going back 2 days later again, it was so good! Both times we got the hot stone bibimbop bowl (definitely get the hot stone). It was delicious with such a variety of ingredients. We also tried a bulgogi banh mi, spicy pork and short rib tacos, and the gamja fries with garlic-sesame aioli. The bulgogi was delicious as were the fries (crispy). The tacos were good, just not as big of a star as everything else."
"lol. another place white people like.had a craving for bi bim bop.i ordered it. i ate it. it was filling.a quick place to eat ""asian cuisine with a twist"" and tide you over til you eat real korean goodness.*mic drop*"
The Seseme Chili Shrimp tacos are amazing. It's hard to get anything else when those shrimp are so good. Good place!
"I tried the sesame chili shrimp taco and kalbi taco, and both were decent, but the tortillas were cold. Our main reason for coming here, the kimchi fries, turned out to be a let-down. Sure, they were crispy and nicely fried, but there was nothing extraordinary about them. The pork belly was barely visible and I barely tasted the kimchi."
"So underwhelming!  If you want cold, tired tacos mixed with a dash of Korean flavor, come here.  If you haven't had REAL Korean food, I understand how this might appeal to you.  But please, do yourself a favor and have the real thing, then come back and tell me you like it.  I am not hating on the idea of Korean-Mexican Fusion.  I would love them to succeed.  But their current offerings are not up to par.  We had the kalbi, spicy bbq chicken,spicy bbq pork and shrimp tacos.  The meats were served cold, which was unfortunate.  The shrimp did arrive hot but had a heavy breaded coating.  The slaw could have been brighter but I think that it was one of their higher points.  I wish there was slightly more for better balance.  The corn tortillas were there, but didn't really add anything, other than being a wrapper.  We also had the Seoul Style Street Dumplings which were served on a plastic lined tray.  The dumpling skins were gummy and the pork filling was very dense.  They resembled frozen grocery-store dumplings, even though they were supposed to be handmade.   I did appreciated the organized counter service, where the cashier also seats you so there isn't any ""saving of tables"" or walking around aimlessly looking for an empty table.  If I was craving Korean and was only limited to Lincoln Park, I would much rather go to Crisp."
"I'm from Seoul and I ate at Del Seoul!     After contemplating what I'm gonna eat during these heat wave, and seeing the ROTD.  I had out with my co-worker and start our way up to Lincoln Park.       Upon entering, first thing I notice is the OG Korean Shrimp chips (regular and spicy) and Sriracha hot sauce (My favorites!)  Items are simple enough, I ordered 2 Kalbi tacos, 2 pork tacos and Kimchi fries with pork belly.  It's alot of food but I skipped breakfast and I was starving.     Pretty awesome place I thought, this place can seriously complete with the Kogi Truck in L.A.  Your tacos come with cabbage mixed with gochujang and sesame seeds and pretty good amount of it.  I had to eat the veggies with my chopsticks before I chomped down on a dual layered korean kalbi and pork heaven.  Beef and pork were marinated beautifully and dash of sriracha just made it so much better.  They will assign you a number and bring the food to your table, but you have to get the napkins and silverware yourself.       Steamed dumplings were selling like hot cakes when I was there, just about every table ordered them, I will make sure to try that out next time.  Parking can be hectic if you drive, but I can assure you, it will be totally worth it.  4 kalbi tacos, 2 pork tacos, and kimchi fries = 26 dollars.  Not bad!DAE HAN MIN GUK!FIGHTING!"
"OVER RATED for sure...most of my friend hyped this place up so i gave it a try.. i ordered 1 of each taco and the kimchi fries to see what is everybody is talking about... total came out to 26 dollars something for 5 tacos, a order of fries, and drink.. so I'm saying to myself.. it better be mind blowing or something for 26 dollars...the chicken taco was pretty good, the kalbi and then BBQ pork tasted very similar! the fish was just OK.. nothing special at all... the shrimp is pretty good but for the price, at least give me 3 shrimps in my taco! lol... kimchi fries... its seasoned fries with a alittle of kimchi,onoins,pock,scallion,cheese and sour cream in the middle... it was ok..nothing to be wowed about besides it being 7 dollars... not saying this place is bad... but for the price, there is far more other places to go eat at around the area that is good and cheaper then Del Seoul..."
"Great concept, convienient location, fast service, and excellent food. Came here with a buddy so we could knock out all the variations of tacos. The pork and shrimp tacos were to die for, while the short rib and fish taco left us slightly dissapointed. Not saying they were bad, just the pork and especiially the shrimp tacos left us with flavor shock. Kimchi fries were good too. Plus I love when ethnic places like this carry natives drinks. They've got a nice selection like coco palm and other types of imported beverages. Del Seoul is unique and different. Their tacos are full of flavor and great textures. I bet their other korean dishes are equally good. Give them a try, you'll be happy you did."
"Came from LA, birthplace of Korean kogi tacos. Tried kimchi fries, dumpling, Galbi taco and chicken wings. Each was done to perfection. Even the kimchi was great, as it should be made. Only suggestion is a little more rice vinegar in the dumpling dipping sauce. Kudos to Chicago!"
"I've had almost everything from the Tacos, Banh Mi, Kalbi and Bulgogi plates, and fries.  Fiance loves the Shrimp tacos.  Love coming into the area for good eats, and Del Seoul never disappoints.  Cheap, Tasty, and Filling.  Parking can sometimes be a little bit difficult in the area, but it's nice to walk around a bit after (plenty of dessert places)."
"I'm a huge fan of the Kogi BBQ Taco truck in LA (the original korean taco) and I was super excited that a korean taco place opened up in Chicago.  I finally made it here yesterdayWe came at 6 pm on Saturday and the place was about 1/2 full and the wait to order food was pretty short.    I ordered the shrimp taco and the Kalbi taco and split an order of dumplings with my friend.  He also ordered a Bahn Mi sandwich.Taco impression:  While they were enjoyable I was overall a bit disappointed in the flavor.  The slaw on top ends up being the predominant flavor, and they could use some more spice (it was a little bit bland).  The kalbi itself was delicious but the shrimp taco was the winner.  I liked the crunchy breading on the shrimp and there was a spicy sauce that was pretty good.The dumplings: tasted clearly homemade, with a big thick noodle wrapper and full of hot pork.  The sauce it came with was pretty standard.  These were filling too.  Tasty, but nothing that special  I guess nothing really ""wowed"" me.  I saw a bunch of people eating bi bim bop which I'm always a fan of but not something I can't get at any other korean place."
Kalbi tacos = awesome ! It reminds me of the korean food trucks I tried in Cali ! I'm glad they opened up Del Seoul. I can't wait to go back. It definitely lived up to my expectations. Try it out. You won't be disappointed :)Get kimchi fries!
"I'm married to a Korean so maybe my standards are too high, but I found the BBQ to be overly sweet.  It was definitely not up to the homemade standards I have been spoiled with.  The rest of the taco ingredients were not too special either."
"I am so very sad to write this review as I have eaten here many times, but I came here on a Sunday afternoon with by husband and two young children and had an awful experience.  We situated our kids and ordered for them the dumplings, which they loved.  We ordered the kimchi fries (which were underwhelming and not as great as I remember), kimchi fried rice (which was okay--liked the SPAM) and kalbi tacos.  My husband took a bite of the taco and he saw something moving in it and out dropped a COCKROACH (!!!) from the taco he was eating.  It fell to the table and then he took it up to the manager.  To their credit, I think it shocked everyone else too.  They were good about clearing the tacos away and making them new and then comping our meal.  It was so traumatic though that my husband was visibly shaking.  We talked later to our friends who own a restaurant and work at restaurants and it is their belief that when a cockroach is so brazen as to climb into the food, it speaks of a kitchen that is infested and needs professional remediation.  I am sad, I liked the food here and its flavors, but I am not sure I can go back now."
"Korean Taco's, what a great idea!I've been here before a few times and its always been consistent. This isn't gourmet food so don't expect to be floored by out of this world flavors. The food is good and flavorful. What else would you expect? It's a simple fast food joint to get you fix for Korean food in Mexican wrapping. My favorite is the shrimp taco and the kimchi fries with a side of that grape soda. Dumplings are also delicious but definitely too much for only two people so make sure you share with friends. A great way to taste the variety of tacos they offer is to make the two tacos into four and rotate among your group. Once you've figured out which one's you like the most, come back next time and order those."
"Yumm!  This was my first stop on my weekend food adventure in Chicago.  This was recommended by a friend and I thought that it was really weird.  Tacos? Korean?  I came here with the intention of ordering something that's not a taco, but I was convinced to tryyyyy it.  (it really wasn't too hard to convince me...)  shrimp taco, kalbi taco, and kimchi fries were delicious.  I really wanted to try every taco, but too bad my stomach is smaller than my appetite.  We also ordered the dumplings.  They were OK.  Not as special as the tacos and kimchi fries.  Will definitely visit again.. when I visit Chicago again.. or move there :)"
"Stopped in for a quick bite and had the Kalbi and spicy pork tacos.  Two were good for a snack.  But I'll get one of each of the five tacos next time I stop by.  They're made with just enough substance to kinda fall apart as you're eating them but not rip the taco shell or just be way too messy to wanna mess with.  The gamja fries were good thanks to the sauce but aside from that, they're just normal fries.  Gotta try the Kimchi fries next time around.The service isn't bad and the food comes out rather quick.  Maybe it was just because it wasn't really busy on that Tuesday night.Not a bad spot.  Worth a second visit...someday..."
"I have been here at least 5 times this year. Yea I know.  They expanded the space a few months ago so there's way more seating available.  It was always busy when I've been but not much of a wait.  So you order at the register, then they bring your food  to the table .  Food service is quick, the food was ready within 5 minutes unless you order one of the BBQ plates, but the menu says allow 12-15 mins for those.Bulgogi banh mi sandwhich- this is by far my favorite item.  The meat is always flavorable and you get a lot of meat.  It comes with traditional ""banh mi"" fixings, with the inclusion of the red peper aioli (delish).  The bread is really fresh, soft yet crispy on the outside, just the way I like my baguettes, if you like the bread from Nhu Lan you will definitely like this (I swear they must get them from there).Tacos- I have tried all of the tacos with the exception of the new sambal fish taco.  The kalbi is the best of the bunch.  Again, you get a pretty generous serving of meat.  The chicken was so-so, the pork is yummy and well seasoned, but the shrimp was blah.  I mean it was good, but you get like 2 shrimps.Bibimbop- I had the ribeye steak.  Blah, I would not get this again.  There's less meat in this whole whole then in the sandwich and it's $2 more so I would get the sandiwch if you're craving meat.   The meat was good (their beef is really good here), but the vegetables were barely seasoned, if you've had the steamed vegetables from crisp you'lll know what I mean.  The egg was cooked to perfection, but overall this dish was underwhelming.Dumplings- they give you a lot for $6.  Plenty for 2 people.  They were good, but I don't really come here  or anywhere for dumplings.Fries-very good, light and crispy, and NOT oily.   I don't usually order fries anywhere.  They were fantastic."
"I love kogi truck in LA, so wherever I move, I'm craving Korean tacos.  Del Seoul is the only spot in Chicago that I've found, so it suffices my craving every so often, but it's nowhere near the bar set by kogi truck.  The shrimp, fish, and beef tacos were decent, back lack the true feel of Korean fusion.  The pork belly fries are not worth getting."
"The only item I've tried is the Sesame-Chile Shrimp tacos. Every time I go in, I say I'm going to try something new, but those tacos call out to me. They are so amazing delicious. My only wish is that they put double the amount of the slaw on the tacos. The slaw is that good. Now, if only they were a bit closer to me and not on the clusterscrew of Clark, I'd be in heaven!"
"Me - ""Guess what babe""?The Wife - ""What?""Me - ""There's a spot in Chicago that has Korean tacos and fries with kimchi and pork belly""The Wife - ""Are you serious?""Me - ""I am and this is where we are going for dinner""And off we went, on our way to Lincoln Park for what could have been the best thing ever or a complete disaster. Korean food is so good but when done poorly and then slapped in a corn tortilla, it could get real ugly. Del Seoul labels itself as Korean street food and with Korean delights stuffed in taco shells, dumplings, bibimbop, banh mi sandwiches (typically Vietnamese), and some traditional Korean plates, you know this place will most likely gonna be a home run.Rest assured, I read the reviews on Yelp and they sold us. But, you just never know until you actually make a trip.As we walked in the door and looked at the menu a particular song popped in my head and a smile began to form. I was so beside myself with the menu options (I'm exaggerating slightly, I do have some tact and class), in my head I started singing the Fat Boys ""All You Can Eat.""""Stuff your face to funky beat""""Give me some bologna, salami, and ham /Toast with butter and strawberry jam.""Don't get the wrong idea, Del Seoul is not a buffet or all you can eat. And they don't have strawberry jam. But, what they do have is Korean tacos and other wondrous things. I was starving, and everything on the menu looked so damn good I wanted to order it all. I didn't care, I worked out at lunch time and was ready to put health aside for an evening of overindulgence and food-related debauchery.So, cooler heads prevailed, mainly due to my wife's realistic approach to ordering food and not feeling like crap afterward. We settled on trying three of the five offered tacos, which were sesame-chili shrimp, sambal fish and kalbi. We did not try the BBQ pork or chicken but these two will not escape my grasp next time.  And, these tacos are really big! We also ordered the kimchi fries, which were, yes, standard french fries covered in sauteed kimchi, onions, scallions, melted cheddar and jack cheese and sour cream.  Yes, all those ingrediants come standard. This was not some poor college student's concoction, as I am not a poor college student  and I didn't add these things myself. Del Seoul's owners decided to put crumbles of pork belly, kimchi and cheese on fries and serve it to willing Chicagoans.They.were.not.playing.around. And neither we. We got down on those fries and after I consumed three tacos and my wife two, we could not finish the fries. Well, I could have, but like I said before, cooler heads did prevail and that cool head of mine somewhat stayed present as I ate cuz I didn't reach the wax paper covering the plastic basket.So, yes, the kimchi fries were ridonkulous. The fries by themselves would be mediocre but with the rest of the craziness they were out of this world. The toppings did cause some of the fries to be soggy but I don't mind that as the taste is so good. And, for the first time in my life I ate fries with chopsticks.  Very novel idea, indeed.  This will be done again, perhaps with tater tots next.So, the tacos.  Busta Rhymes said it best...""WHOO-HA, GOT YOU ALL IN CHECK."" Yessir, the tacos had me in check. I had no move to make except to eat each one, and it was well worth it. Each taco was double wrapped in corn tortillas and then the meat or fish was topped with really nice cabbage. The kabli (short ribs) were really really tasty with tender chunks that had great grilled beef flavor. The sesame-chili shrimp was my next favorite as these hand-battered panko shrimp were doused in cilantro-onion relish, secret slaw and toasted sesame. Then, we had the best of all, the sambal fish, which had a huge hunk of tempura fish, with pickled red onions, napa slaw and sambal aioli. Add some sirachi to that thing and, BOOM, you had one of the tastiest tacos in any form of any ethnic food category.  Oh, how I do want to go back now.There are so many good looking items on the menu it's hard to decide what to do. Del Seoul does not have a huge menu, it's just that every single thing looks good to me.  So, when you walk in you will order at the counter, pay, and then sit with a number. Your food will be brought out to you and told what is what. You will grab your chopsticks, lots of napkins and then feast.  Make sure you get a soda or some coconut water. You will smile as you eat, talk about how great the food is to your company, or to yourself, however you want to work that out, and ""stuff your face to a funky beat!""Look out for the very reasonable prices and friendly service. Clear you own table and walk off your meal while you venture over to Molly's cupcakes only a few doors south.Del Seoul is worth it."
"I felt that the quality of the food has gone down. During the recent few times, I found the tacos quite mediocre. Both the quality and the quantity of the beef in the Kalbi seem to have become lower."
"Del Seoul instantly became a favorite food destination for myself in Chicago. I have now had everything on their menu including their new fish tacos. Korean and taco fusion is slowly spreading across the US and I am happy it has. They use Korean-style marinated meats and top their tacos with a korean style napa cabbage slaw. Napa cabbage is what is used for traditional kimchi.  The napa cabbage slaw from what I can tell has a spicy soy sauce and sesame oil base. They call it a secret slaw for what I am deducing has a few other ingredients. This slaw is good enough to eat on its own.They have bulgogi (literal translation: Fire Meat) banh mi sandwiches. They are marinated in a soy sauce based sauce and combine perfectly with the pickled daikon and carrots.If tacos or sandwiches are not your thing, they do offer bibimbap (mixed rice bowls with veggies) and BBQ Plates with rice. These are nice options that can be found at a variety of Korean restaurants, buuuuut.......Tacos are what we have come for right???As far as the tacos go, the chicken is simply overshadowed by the other flavorful meat options. From the Galbi tacos, to the pork, to their awesome Sesame-Chili Shrimp. The shrimp taco has such a soft crunch to it, that it makes it their most popular taco. The fish taco takes about 10 minutes to finish, but it is well worth the wait. But be careful when you bite into, as a pocket of steam erupts from the insides. It stays crunchy all the way to the last bite. And finally, my absolute favorite item belongs to the Kimchi Fries. When I first read the description, I thought it was insane to mix kimchi, fries and cheese. Oh how I was wrong! These loaded fries have no comparison in my mind. They are fries topped with chopped kimchi, chopped pork belly, onions, scallions, melted Cheddar and I believe a type of jack with a dollop of sour cream to top it off. PHENOMENAL. AMEIMO (A Must Eat In My Opinion). FYI - They need to start selling their T-Shirts!"
"YUM!!!! I am a definite fan!!! Every time we order from here, I am left in a food coma for the rest of the day. We always have to ask for extra sauce to pour over the rice and for the beef dipping because the sauce that is drizzled all over the meat is just not enough...You can't go wrong with the Bulgogi or the Kalbi...Essentially the same meal just with different kids of meat...All in all, DA BOMB!!!! =)"
"I, and everyone I bring here, are totally addicted to their food.  They have great Kalbi tacos, shrimp tacos, chicken tacos, and pork tacos.  Try to order in moderation because this is a place where your eyes are definitely bigger than your stomach.  Bottom line, great location, and AMAZING food!"
"I love tacos and i adore korean food, this has to be one of the best ideas to combine the 2we tried almost all the tacos, (in the order of our favs) 1. shrimp 2. fish 3. pork 4. kalbireasonable price, great/quick service, i wish i live closer to Del Seoul!"
"Oh how I love this place. My opinion of them keeps getting better...except for the fact that I already have given 5 stars. If I could give 6 I would. The Shrimp Bahn Mi rocked my world. I love the bulgogi one but this shrimp one was perfectly made.And as always, gamja fries are where it's at!"
"Before I even finished chewing my first bite of BBQ ribeye banh mi I knew I was going to come back, and Del Seoul is conveniently located in Lincoln Park, which is not-so-conveniently located to my Logan Square/Humbolt Park digs so that's really saying something.I came here with a friend of mine who recommended Del Seoul as a good, quick dinner spot near Next Door Cafe, which is where we had planned on spending the rest of the evening plotting our world takeover.  In reviewing the menu, I gravitated to the banh mi because I'm boring sometimes and like to stick with what is comfortable to me.  I ordered the BBQ ribeye from the counter, and $6.25 and only a few minutes later the beautiful sandwich was before me.  The sandwich consisted of a large mound of Korean BBQ meat and pickled veggies stuffed into an 8-inch (maybe more?) hoagie.  A few slivers of jalapeno, chopped cilantro and a squeeze of red pepper aioli sauce topped it off.  I don't thank I've eaten anything bad that came with a generous helping of aioli.  The sandwich was gone much too soon and I wished that I could start all over again as soon as I finished.  Someone next to me was eating a platter of three Korean BBQ tacos and they looked ridiculously good.  They resembled the small ""street tacos"" that are all the rage and were piled high with lots of good stuff.  I am definitely going to try the tacos the next time along with the fries I keep reading about.  My friend also said the bibimbop (rice bowl) is very good so I think it's pretty fare to say that you can't go wrong with anything on the menu."
"Their food is totally addictive. My fave items are pretty much all the Korean tacos, especially sesame-chili shrimp and spicy BBQ pork. If you want something more substantial, Kalbi beef short rib entry is super flavorful and delicious as well."
"Del Seoul's food is so incredibly delicious that it kind of freaks me out. Have I been to Korea? No, but I have eaten a LOT of Korean food in my lifetime. Out of all the places in Chicago that I frequent, this is one place that will keep bringing me back again and again.I've gotten take-out from here 5 times now, and every time I've been totally blown away. I find it difficult to speak during my meal because I am always so focused on the pure deliciousness. Now-- I haven't tried the tacos that everyone keeps talking about but the Kalbi plate and bibimbap are absolutely out of this world!! The dumplings are also phenomenal! The flavours are beautiful, really. The meat is always tender and juicy, and never over-sauced or over-seasoned. The vegetables are crisp and flavourful; never overcooked or undercooked. The chefs also pay careful attention to the simple, but often over-looked details like sesame seeds and sliced green onion on top of the rice.The portion sizes are generous and the ingredients are fresh and high-quality. I'm sure many yelpers are familiar with the uneasy feeling that sometimes takes hold of a person's stomach after a meal. I have NEVER had this feeling after eating food from Del Seoul. In fact, my stomach is always ""happy"" after eating. My wife described it simply as this-- ""My stomach is saying ""thank you!"" I agree.I see some 1, 2 and 3 star reviews here. I honestly have no idea what that's all about-- it doesn't make sense to me. To be on the safe side, if you're already a fan of Korean food like I am, maybe try something more traditional first before getting into the tacos (of mexican origin) and bánh mì (of vietnamese origin).I don't know what more to say. This place is wonderful and the food is *damn* good! What's more is, they just finished some construction and remodeling last week and the dining room is nice and roomy now. If you've caught the vibe of my review, please believe me when I say that you will not be disappointed. Go to Del Seoul and have a great experience!"
Pretty good food! The way they marinate their meat is yummy - especially their short ribs. I ordered one of their hot bowls with tofu and it was pretty good. Would def come back.
"Can I get an Over-Rated?!I came to this place based on my friends over-hyped review of this joint, making it sound like this was the next best thing since sliced bread. I left here  feeling like I was a Cubs fan (not that I am one) for the last 102 years, disappointed. I ordered the kalbi tacos, bibimbop, and the almighty kimchi fries. Kalbi Tacos - Hmm...how to describe it...ah, yes. The word tasteless comes to my mind. Sugary sweet tacos should be saved for desserts. I had to drench this thing in sriracha to make it decent. Kim Chi Fries - Wtf? 7$ for fries with shredded kimchi on top.Bibimbop - Ok, this was actually pretty good. Which is what the two stars are for.Del Seoul is the most overrated thing in this city since Cade Mcnown. If you want korean food, you go to a korean restaurant. If you want tacos, you go to a Mexican restaurant. But mixing the two is not a good idea - in doing so, they have created Frankenstein. PS to my friend - I want my $25 back for coming here, you turd."
"Had the fish and shrimp taco along with the fries that we so raved about.If i went back I would get the fish taco for sure.  It is a HUGE piece of fish in the taco, sooooo good 9/10.  The shrimp was okay but nothing super special, not saying it was bad though.7/10The fries were a let down.  After seeing so many people love them on yelp i had to try them but the fries were just seasoned okay and they didnt give you much garlic aole.  I would give them a 7/10.Good prices, fast food, wish it was closer to my apartment."
"Just tried this place the other day and it was alright. I was hoping it would be better, as I felt a little let down.I had the short rib, bbq chicken and pork tacos which were good, but I really didn't taste anything other than the meat and tortilla. I was anticipating a little more flavor than what I got. I added some sriracha sauce to make up for the lack of flavor. I also had the fries with the garlic sesame aioli. The aioli tasted more like ranch, didn't really taste much sesame at all.Even though I felt let down I will come back and try one of their Bahn Mi sandwiches, I've heard those are good from people's whose opinions I trust. Hopefully this will change my opinion of this place."
"Don't often like to rate based on one item, but these fish taco are the business! Didn't care so much for the shrimp, but you shouldn't order anything other than the fish anyway. Bit pricey for one taco, but loved every bit of that FISH TACO."
"One of my favorite places in Chicago--the tacos are AMAZING!!! I definitely like the fish tacos but honestly anything here is amazing. Also, the potstickers are awesome!"
"This Korean BBQ place is hands down one of my favorites in Chicago!  It's cheap, fast, and so delicious.It's not a huge restaurant and has become fairly popular, so you might have to wait a few minutes in line to order at the counter, but it's totally worth it.I get their Kalbi (beef tacos)- 2 of them- and the seasoned Gamja Fries with the garlic dipping sauce.  Beware that eating these tacos is a little messy since some of the stuff will guaranteed fall out, but it's extremely tasty!For 2 tacos and a side of fries, the order was about $8, which isn't bad at all.  They give you a number for your table and bring you the food when it's ready.  You can also call ahead and pick up the food to go, which is a great feature if you don't want to wait around there for it.  Overall, I love this place and try to frequent it as much as I can!"
"Sooo pissed off about the extremely limited veggie options...I've been meaning to check this joint out for a while now. The night was rainy and cold, perfect to indulge in some smoky korean flavors. Just found 1 entree option (the bibimbop) for us vegetarians with a side of gamja fries. We ordered this in a hot stone bowl and our waitress was kind enough to educate us about how to eat it. And OMFG was it fireworks in my mouth?? The spicy tangy smoky sauce added into the mix of veggies and rice was so delectable. The gamja fries, which are fries dusted with korean blend of spices served with an aioli was finger licking good too. Like I said the only sad part is the limited options."
"While I like the fact that Chicago's food scene is slowly getting better, I had an issue with this place. One evening I had ordered 3 tacos, a mix of pork and chicken, and surprisingly had a shellfish allergic reaction.  While I am not and thankfully not hyper sensitive, it made me wonder how their kitchen can mix something like this up. I think Korean tacos are the best thing under the sun after visiting the Kogi truck in LA.  This place just needs to get their s* together and hope I that they do."
"Great food. The dumplings are not as amazing as everyone else seems to think. I did like the pork belly kimchi fries. My friend had the chicken tacos, not so great. However everything else was great."
"Love this place. They also sell big jars of kimchi that you can take home. Tacos are wonderful. Atmosphere is laid back, clean, and they usually have some good tunes going."
Not only is the food amazing but the staff is really friendly and did I mention the food is awesome.
"So what's the deal with this place?  It's Korean BBQ but wrapped up in some other ethnic package.  Strange and interesting but somehow...harmonious.  Korean BBQ in a Mexican taco, in a Vietnamese sandwich, and on American fries.  Huh.  It's not the first I've heard of this concept, I think it's been in LA and NYC food trucks for a couple of years now, so I'm glad to see the trend has finally hit here.  I'm not sure who came up with this wacky and tasty idea originally but I can tell you this:  I sure am glad Del Seoul brought it to us in Chicago!We somehow managed to refrain from ordering one of each menu item, which is what we really wanted to do since there were so many delicious and interesting looking options.  Honestly, I don't know how we didn't.  We still did a fair job, however, considering that we were 2 chicks and we ordered 4 full meals.We each started with a taco.  Actually, we ordered the same taco.  It was the Sesame-Chili Shrimp, and it sounded too good to pass up... or share, for that matter.  And let's just say that we made the right decision.  It was described as being hand battered in panko with a sesame-chili aioli and slaw but it was really so much more than that.  The panko breading didn't seem like panko to me.  It had a denser texture, almost like a cornmeal crust.  Maybe they crushed the spiky breadcrumbs first...or maybe it was just the bottom of the bag.  Either way, we won.  The shrimp must've also been tossed in a sweet chili sauce after they came out of the fryer because they had a thick, crunchy coating but it was also soft and oozing with flavor at the same time.  The bright slaw and toasted sesame seeds made them complete.  Sooo delicious.  I would definitely order this again.Our seriously gluttonous selection came next:  Kimchi and Pork Belly Fries.  With cheese.  Yes, you read that right.  And holy crap, was it good.  A light kimchi, not too acidic with melty little bits of pork belly, aka pork fat, with melted cheddar and jack cheese, sour cream, scallions and sesame seeds... on french fries.  Omg, I can't believe I ordered that.  I think I have to spend an extra 15 minutes at the gym just for writing about it.  Anyway, it's like a cross between nachos and cheese fries, but Korean.  As you can imagine, it was REALLY good.See the bits of onion and pork?  Wowza.Next were the Korean street food dumplings.  I can't say that this was my favorite thing we ordered, but they had tough competition.  It was some little mystery-meat filled dumpling with a beautiful, chewy dough and a sake-soy dipping sauce.  They were tasty little pouches but that's about all I've got for ya.   The Hot Stone Bowl Veggie Bibimbop was our last (tear) item and I enjoyed it very much.  When it arrived at our table, we could hear the rice searing in the bottom of the super hot, cast-iron bowl... which is a good thing.  It was piled high with a beautiful variety of colorful veggies, including carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, bean sprouts, daikon, and some greens, then topped with a perfectly runny sunny side up egg.  We were instructed to stir in the sticky, red soy bean/chili paste until the whole thing was homogeneous.  What we ended up with was a hearty bowl of crispy white rice with lots of veggies and broken egg with a sort of sweet depth.  Yum.  (It was good for lunch the next day, too!)It's a good thing the food is so good because the place is nothin' much to look at.  It's a simple, small store front containing only about 8 or 10 sort of nonchalantly place tables in a room without much decoration.  It's just that kind of place.  It's not about anything but the delicious meal you're about to eat.  And I'm fine with that.  The service, too, was very casual but also fair friendly.  The girl at the counter was clearly part of the family operation and so was very informative and useful in our decision making process.  Our food came out of the kitchen quickly and was delivered immediately, which leads me to believe that the entirety of the restaurant is very efficient. My only regret is that I didn't get to try one of the Bahn-Mi sandwiches... or the Korean BBQ plates.... or the short ribs... or the spicy BBQ pork...The short version (out of 10)...Food:  8.5Service:  9Ambiance:  5Overall impression:  8Would I go back?  For sure.  I kinda have to in order to try all of the above mentioned goodies!  This would definitely be a go-to spot for me if I lived in Lincoln Park."
I have been here many times since my original review.  Now I almost exclusively get the shrimp tacos.  A-MAZ-ING!
"One of my co-workers recommended this place and I was a bit skeptical because I don't like Korean food that much and in a taco?  But wow, my bad I guess.  This place was really good.  I'm from Cali, where people try putting anything into a tortilla and call it a taco and after the meal I was wondering how noone out there had thought of putting Korean meats in tacos, unreal and really good the way that Del Seoul does it.  I went with the GF and we ordered every taco (short rib, fish, chicken, pork) except the shrimp since she is allergic to shellfish (lame) and some seasoned fries with aioli sauce.  Every taco was delicious with the exception of the fish which was just alright.  The fish was fried (which I like in my fish tacos) but it was just OK compared to the other ones which were amazing.  They were so good we ordered another round of the short rib, chicken and pork and the fries were also seasoned well and good.  The place is really nice and the food is pretty cheap for what you get.  It may sound like the GF and I ordered a lot but we can eat, I think I'd be good with 2-3 tacos and fries.  When we went in, they had a good reggae playlist going which took me back to Cali.  Any restaurant that isn't afraid to play reggae is OK in my book.  I know we will be back in the near future.  I might be back without the GF to try the shrimp which I heard is good."
"Sooooo I got hired at a new job last week. And would you like to know the first thought that ran through my mind once I was told I landed the job? It isn't pleasant, or lady-like, but I'll share. ""MOTHER*^$%@$!! Now how am I supposed to get my Del Seoul for lunch twice a week?! SON OF A B!TCH!!"" The hiring manager on the phone said she expected more excitement. I kid, I didn't actually say such a thing, but for reals, I was concerned about the sharp decline in my Del Seoul intake.So why did I comtemplate passing on an excellent job for Korean street food twice a week? Because Del Seoul was a whole new world for me. All you fancified Chicagoans have been exposed to ethnic foods for most of your life; I come from West Virginia. Olive Garden still pops up as the ""prefered authentic Italian choice"", aight. The idea of anything Korean, let alone served in a little baby corn shell, was amazing to me. Sesame-chili shrimp deliciousness, battered and then snuggled in a creamy blanket of sesame-chili aoli and topped with the fun of Korean slaw, which I liken to a more vinegary taste, but oh so good. And even better in a banh mi! (And more filling because it's massive, ahem). The gamja fries and dumplings are also must-trys, and if you hate them the first time, try them again. I found the fries gross the first time I had them, and then slapped myself the second time I tried them because they are actually quite delicious. I guess my sad palate just had to catch up to its new location. Thank goodness Del Seoul is only a few blocks away from me and a cheap dinner option instead of lunch, otherwise I'd still be unemployed, but well-fed around noon."
Awesome tacos with Korean flair. Great prices. Fast-food service. Be back very soon.
Good food. It's got Seoul!Wish they would go easy with the fish sauce in the taco's veggie. It's a bit much... but still tasty.
"Seriously good Korean BBQ!!! Cheap. Delicious. Casual.The shrimp tacos and kalbi beef tacos are my fav! Add a side of delicious kimchi fries. Don't get discouraged by the long line, it goes by quick. They have their system down pat. By the time your food comes out, they'll find you a table. Seems like they're doing really well because they're already expanding. Be prepared to leave fully stuffed and smelling like yummy Korean meat."
"This place is always packed. Among tacos, Korean kalbi, sambal fish, and BBQ pork are my favorite! You gotta try their spicy tofu hotpot too."
"Absolutely love this place. Thier Dol Sot Bi Bim Bop always comes out sizzling and the rice is always crunchy at the bottom (heaven!!). The sizzling plates are plentiful and delicious, as are thier tacos. KimChi fries are a must! Parking sucks but it's worth the drive around. Staff is pretty friendly and the place is clean. I believe they're expanding soon, they need to!!"
"Come here when you're having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. It will improve. Promise. I am having one of those m'self and I'll be taking my own advice. I have no idea why it took so long for the Korean taco trend to make its way to Chicago but thank goodness it's here. It will change your life in a good way.I am sure del Seoul has a ton of great food options. It's likely I will try them all one day. But for now, the only thing I need from del Seoul are tacos (well, and the fries. I'll get to that later). I need all of their tacos (except for the kalbi bc I don't eat beef). My favorite of the tacos is the chicken. Korean bbq chicken surrounded by garlic, chilis, slaw, and onion relish. Every bite was a revelation. I kid you not. I took the time to chew and truly savor the explosion of flavor. These are not anemic tacos. Each taco is a substantial piece of food that will command your full attention. Next fave is the pork. Sweet & spicy grilled pork with veggies is always made of win. The shrimp were my least liked (but, on a relative scale we're still talking ""I love this food!""). I wasn't crazy about the breading. What I _did_ like was that the tortillas for all of the tacos added to the taste, rather than taking away. This wasn't just 'scoop some kimchi in a taco shell and sell it.' This was a concerted effort to blend food and make something even better.And what can be better than Korean tacos? Fries with stuff on 'em. The kimchi and pork belly fries come out on a platter so large, I doubted my ability to finish them. I mean, I did because I'm a fatty but I wouldn't recommend taking this on for one person. This is a platter of fries stocked with kimchi, onions, scallions, CHEESE, AND pork belly. It's like everything that's good about savory food in one place... touching each other. Your belly will need you to split these but your greed might not let you. Greed is good. Y'know, that bad day I'm having... it's about to get a LOT better bc as soon as I hit 'post'... well, you know what I'm doin'. Turn your frown upside down!"
"Korean tacos? A very interesting concept that they have here. The first time I heard about this place, I was a bit intrigued about having a fusion between Korean food wrapped around tortilla. Overall, I think the food here is great! The prices might be a bit pricey, but I think that it is well worth the crave.Definitely, have to try the Shrimp and the Kalbi tacos. It is simply the most delicious and most flavorful food I've ever had at this price. For appetizers the Kimchi fries were good, but a bit overpriced..."
"Yum, yum, yum!  I love Korean food, and love taco's - the marriage between them works perfectly.  On a Tuesday night, the crowd wasn't too bad - plenty of tables and waited only about 10 minutes for take out.  We got a ton of food for two people:- Fish taco - delish.  Very large piece of fried fish with a spicy mayo type sauce and slaw.  It was HUGE (and a little more expensive than the rest), but really worth it.- Kalbi taco - again, delish.  The meat was marinated and flavorful, combined with the slaw there was a lot of good stuff going on in my mouth.- Shrimp taco - the one that I did not love.  I really couldn't distinguish the shrimp, and when I did notice it in my mouth I was not pleased.  It's supposedly one of their ""most popular"" tacos - but I wouldn't recommend- Bibimbop - pretty good.  But probably better if you eat in- Pork taco - I didn't have any, but the hubby said that the kalbi taco was much better- Fries - so not worth it.  Should have known better than to get fries at a Korean taco joint - next time I'll stick with the kimchee or pickeled cucumbersExcited to return!"
"So, Del Seoul expanded next door, which gives you NO reason to say it's too crowded anymore. That being said, I took comfort in not having to take my food as carry out.I tried the Bulgogi Sandwich (ribeye steak) along with the steak taco and shrimp taco. I loved my bahn mi, how can you go wrong which such simple and flavorful ingredients? The sauce was tangy, the bread was fresh, and the sandwich was definitely filling for one. I enjoyed the two tacos, but of course, they were super hard to eat. But, when your tacos are loaded with ingredients, you can't complain! I liked how the steak taco and the steak bahn mi weren't marinated identically. The shrimpies were salty, sweet, and spicy.I saw some people chomp on the potstickers which looked fresh and steamy, as they should. I'd be curious to try a BBQ plate and the kimchi fries next time!"
"My husband and I were visiting my favorite flower shop, Belmont Flower market, and what do we see next door? Del Seoul! We heard about the place but never tried it, so we decided to stop in for dinner.The biggest pro is that they know how to barbecue.  You can smell the delicious korean bbq smell a block away and the food itself did not disappoint.  Although my health issues has pretty much wiped out meat from my diet in recent times, I do let myself enjoy it from time to time and this was one such time.  I tried the kalbi, pork, and shrimp tacos and the fillings were great.  All three fillings were marinated to true korean bbq perfection. i was very impressed with how tasty it was.Here comes the cons...  to make it more ethnic (I assume), they top the tacos with some type of ""secret"" slaw.  Well, I am a traditional taco girl and I think nothing is better than good old onions and fresh cilantro on a taco.  Even if I was willing to venture out to the heap of slaw they put on the delicious meat, the slaw really did nothing to enhance the tacos.  If they paired the awesome bbq with fresh onions and cilantro, this place would have gotten five stars, for sure.  I'm sure many people like the slaw, but it was a miss for me.We also ordered the special fries and that is a pass... you can get a great side of regular fries for less than 2 bucks here.  Otherwise, you can spend over 6 bucks on some specialty fries that come with kimchi and pork belly.  Well, it was certainly not worth the extra four bucks. You couldn't really taste anything but the kimchi and it just wasn't worth the extra price.Overall, it was a decent experience. I would certainly come again b/c the bbq meats were delicious, but the slaw and the unimpressive and overpriced side keeps this at a 3 star for me. I will certainly try other dishes next time and update my review if need be."
"Even though I feel more like ""meh,"" it's a 3-star meh. Like a ""Meh, it's okay.""Since Crisp put me on to Korean food with Mexican cuisine elements, and made me fall in love with their burritos, I figured I would be titillated in the same way by the tacos at Del Seoul. I figured... incorrectly. Oh, poo.They weren't bad, or to the point of disappointing. But, they weren't remarkably enjoyable either. They just, were. I got the Kalbi and Spicy pork tacos w/a little cup of kimchi. I really liked the kimchi. The tacos, however, didn't move me. There were like steak and pork tacos with just a different type of sauce and sesame seeds on them. I rather just have the Mexican traditional ones if it's just only that.  I know, one may say I could just go back to try the other stuff. But, I live in a neighborhood with a lot Korean eateries, in walking distance, so I'm good on that end too. I think this place works really well for where it is located and that demographic in that area. For me though, I'm neutral. I don't dislike it or like it, but I don't see myself going back."
Love love these Korean tacos!  My favorite are the shrimp ones.
Love the kalbi tacos and spicy pork BBQ plate :) yum! This fast food style restaurant definitely does not taste like fast food. Their inspiration coming from the famous Kogi truck in LA comes through with their fabulous korean tacos. MmmM mMmm...The meats are so well marinated and everything tastes fresh and piping hot. I love the Korean BBQ plates that come on a sizzling plate so you even have a sweet amount of crispy rice! My fav!! This place is the first of it's kind in the Chicago arena and I'm sure with it's popularity and quality it will inspire many more in the near future. All we need now is Del Seoul on wheels! :)
"My first time here, I was expecting a WOW but it was just A-OK.I think they have a ton of potential but since I moved from Los Angeles and tried the original Kalbi Truck, i think nothing will beat my first experience with these korean taco fusion restaurants."
"I think I'm being generous with the 2 stars, FYI.  I have no idea what all the hype is about.  This is the 2nd trendy asian spot that bombed for me [see my review of Urban Belly].  I will stick to ""real"" asian restaurants from now on, thank you!!First off, I like my food to be HOT and not just a hair above warm.  When I get less-than-hot food, I naturally start to think my food isn't up to Chicago Food Service standards and that obviously puts a negative spin on my dining experience. Besides, who doesn't like piping hot food?? The tacos were just EH. The pieces of meat seemed to be very limp and thin. It didn't even have a lot of flavor (or maybe it was just hiding under the 2 lbs of cabbage per taco?). I was scared to eat the chicken bc it seemed a little undercooked and well, less-than-warm.On a brigher note, the dumplings were pretty good!  I wouldn't drive over there and look for parking just for dumplings though (which were almost positively just bought from Restaurant Depot or something of the like).Overall, just not very good, WAY OVERRATED. p.s. Just recollecting the experience made me change my rating to 1 star.  YUCK!"
"Yep it's time, that didn't take long at all.  Went back today with a friend who had been dying to try Del Seoul.  On this cold winter, snow packed day we both got the Hot Stone Bowl Bibimbop.  Layers of rice, veggies, mushrooms, ribeye steak, a fried egg all in a hot stone bowl that crisps the rice at the bottom.  A container of spicy (but not too spicy) Kochujiang sauce to mix in and you have the perfect winter's meal.The staff here is always super friendly, even giving us advice on how to eat and mix our Bibimbop.  The two things I noted that needed improving, suddenly were.  There was a self-serve water station and my friend's can of pop was only $1.  Maybe these things were like that previous and I was too distracted by the smell of Korean BBQ to notice?  Either way, Del Seoul has achieved 5 star perfection in my book."
"Thanks Yelp, A-OK is actually the perfect description!I've been here twice and my review is based solely on the korean tacos and kimchi pork belly fries...Tried the fries the first time and probably won't be getting this again. They sound and look amazing but taste, eh. They aren't bad but I don't know if I can say they are good either... Maybe I just couldn't get over my disappointment in how little pork belly there was, especially for the price.Tacos? My favorite like many others here was the chili-shrimp. Crunchy, tasty and not too heavy... the big mound of ""asian"" relish they put on their tacos and a splash of sriracha makes it even better. The other tacos are the same as the fries... Eh. I live really close so I may be back but probably wouldn't travel for it..."
"I went here with my friend on a weekend. It was busy but we got our order relatively quickly and I was happy that the place was clean.We ordered kalbi tacos, bbq pork tacos, and kimchi fries.Everything was DELICIOUS and filling! I can't wait to go back."
"I LOVE Del Seoul! The shrimp tacos are heaven! Now that I am writing about this place, I want some... And the kimchi fries.... oh the kimchi fries.... I have eaten here more times than I think it is okay to admit and I never get sick of it. It is very casual and a great takeout place. Go. You will enjoy."
"Damn I wish my stomach was as big as my eyes... (ehhhh maayyyybe i take that back - I have some pretty big eyes...) We ordered 1 of each of the 4 taco offerings and they were all pretty tasty.  I think our faves were the kalbi and the shrimp.  The chicken was good but a little bland. The slaw on top of all the tacos was fantastic- fresh and seasoned with the right amount of spicy sauce.We also got a bugolgi bahn mi- lots of well-marinated meat on fresh french bread with your typical pickled items. Pretty tasty!!And... we got an order of the kimchi fries.  Definite least fave item of the night. Don't get me wrong, they were tasty, but not $7 tasty.This is a definite must-try place.  I can't wait to come back to try the dumplings and the hot stone bowl bibimbop!!"
Had a dissapointing/ unappetizing short rib taco here there other day. I just love Korean food. Especially Korean BBQ but the food here leaves a lot to be desired.
"I haven't tried their tacos, but I did get their bibimbop. I've been trying the bibimbop from places all over lakeview, and so far, I like del seoul's the best! Maybe it's the radishes! Who knows?! I have heard some people say there's too much of a mushroom flavor, but I love mushrooms so I didn't mind. I tried the dumplings (which were just normal, nothing special) and the kimchi fries. The only thing I didn't really like on the kimchi fries were the kimchi. Theirs has chunks of meat in them, so be careful if you're a vegetarian!"
"After wanting to check this place out for ages, we finally decided to go on the coldest freaking day of the year. After fighting traffic, searching for parking, and trekking through the cold, I arrived with empty stomach, frozen snot, and an appetite for some tacos. My first thought as I waited in line to order was,  these people sitting down laughing with empty trays had best be gone by the time I order. It's cold, I'm hungry, I need to sit and there's no tables left. I know you see me looking at you.Luckily, we ordered, they left, bloodshed was prevented. The tacos were the star here. Kalbi was my favorite, followed up surprisingly by the panko battered shrimp. We ordered these as a last minute addition and they were really good. I liked the spicy bbq pork too. The chicken was fine, but took a backseat to the rest of them. The slaw is really what makes these tacos. Super tasty. We also tried the bugolgi bahn mi and the kimchi fries. The bahn mi was a good representation of the vietnamese classic. Lots of tasty meat, some heat from the peppers on some fresh bread. The kimchi fries I could skip. They were fine, but not great. Take the seven bucks and order more tacos. I would definitely come back for the tacos alone, but will probably check out more on the menu. Probably in better weather."
"Amazing tacos! Went in a little apprehensive, but came out very satisfied. Tried three different tacos; shrimp, bbq pork, and kalbi. Kalbi tacos were amazing!!!!!!"
"I really like Del Seoul. The shrimp taco's are great. I tried my first shrimp taco there and I was pleasantly surprised. I also really like their grilled beef short rib, served with rice. I will def go back when I have a craving for shrimp taco's. Just make sure you plan on waiting for you food for at least 7 min...but its worth."
"I'm not embarrassed about eating the following menu with my significant other, but she might be.....Sambal Fish TacoSesame Chili Shrimp TacoKalbi TacoSpicy BBQ Pork TacoSpicy BBQ Chicken Taco............and Kimchi friesIn defense of the menu, we were starving and heard great things about Del Seoul. Needless to say Del Seoul lives up to the hype. Everything was good in taco form, especially when you hit it with some Sriracha. Although the wife and I don't get out often we will go out of our way to Del Seoul because it is good. We will bring others and spread the word even though many people know."
awesome tacos
"This place is good, but it wasn't as mind blowing as people claim. Maybe I went on an off night. The recipes were good, but they were poorly executed. Will go back to reassess."
"Who woulda thought Korean and Mexican would go well together? Well, it definitely sounded good to me, and after my first visit there, I had to go back the next day! So good!I really like that they keep the prices decent, and it's a order-at-the-counter & sit-down place. There are too many asian-fusion places that have gone the trendy, expensive route.Yes, the kalbi taco is pretty darn good (I couldn't resist the temptation to try it). They also have other more-traditional Korean dishes, and a veggie bi bim bap for vegetarians. If you get that, get the stone bowl, so you get the crispy rice on the bottom.Also, quick tip: Try the side-dish pickles in the fridge to the left of the register. They add a nice refreshing crunch as a side to the meal."
"They now have fish tacos (Sambal Tacos)! They were delicious.We also ordered the Spicy Chicken and Shrimp tacos.The Spicy chicken tacos were okay. Shrimp tacos, they always put big chunks of Shrimp. We also ordered Kimchi fries - little bit pricey but they smelled good and tasted awesome. Lightly covered with cheese and kimchi flavor and scallions. I wish there were more kimchi flavor but they were yummy."
"The GREATEST thing to happen to Clark St. since the bike lanes were installed!I am addicted to Del Seoul tacos, and I don't care that I eat there at least once a week when I have perfectly good food available at my apartment. The flavors, the kimchi, the perfectly cooked meat are so many steps above the rest on Clark that only Sultan's Market is near their place in the stratosphere.Order one of each of the tacos, some gamja fries, and enjoy. The place is so damn popular, they had to tear down the place next door and double the size of it. Kudos to them"
"Excellent place to grab a quick lunch!  The flavors in the shrimp and fish tacos and kimchi fries are unbeatable!  This is one of our go to spots for lunch when we are in the city.  The chicken and pork tacos are very good too, but the shrimp and fish are too good to pass up if you can only do 2 tacos.  Wish we had modern Korean street food options out in the burbs!"
AMAZIING!!!! Love the veggie hot stone bibimbop and shrimp tacos!!! Reasonably priced and SO good.
"We started our Girl's Night off at Del Seoul a couple weeks ago...   A friend of a friend owns this place and I've been meaning to try it since it opened, but this neighborhood kind of makes me want to stab myself in the eye with a fork so I never really venture up here.  And let me tell you, I've been missing out.  It's an order-at-the-front-counter-and-they'll-bring-it-­to-your-small-table type place and we decided it would be easiest to order all together since we were splitting a couple things.  I'm sure the girl at the counter wanted to strangle all five of us but she kept a smile on her face as we all stared stupidly up at the menu for a good ten minutes.  We split an order of the pork dumplings and the kimchi fries (french fries with sauteed kimchi, onions, pork belly, scallions, melted Cheddar and Jack cheeses and sour cream).  I got the Sesame-Chili Shrimp Bahn-mi (sandwich) which was panko shrimp (sucker for panko breaded things...yum) sesame-chili aioli, pickled daikon, carrots, cilantro and jalapenos.  Heavenly.  Serious flavor with the aioli and jalapenos.  The dumplings were delicious, flavorful and sticky.  Fries were good, I didn't notice the pork belly much but I realized I actually like kimchi (pickled cabbage), who knew?Two girls got the steak bahn-mi and one got the kalbi tacos and wished she got three instead of two.  I'd say that's a good recommendation if I've ever heard one.  The last girl got the steak platter and it was crazy big for the price...BTW, $60 for 5 girls...cheap and delicious, what more could you ask for?"
"Best tacos, ever. A must every time I visit Chi!"
"Oh man, the greatest thing to hit Lincoln Park since Blizzpocalypse '11.  Those shrimp tacos are just something else, you guys.  They're delicious.  They're awesome.  You can go in there feeling like roadkill and leave feeling just fine because of these things, I do declare.The decor is delightful and sweet, and they bring the food out to you while you relax at your table, and it's awesome!  Definitely check out the fries, too, with the white sauce whose name I cannot remember.  It's just so good!"
"So unbelievably fresh and novel.The Banh Mi is fantastic, with its delicious spicy bbq pork and fresh crunchy daikon on a nice baguette.  The ""street dumplings"" are great as well, steamed and a wonderful texture and saltiness.  The spicy fish taco is probably the best $4 I've ever spent, and is a massive piece of tempura battered fish with pickled red onions and a spicy aioli.  And my wife seemed to enjoy the relatively ""safe"" option of the spicy bbq pork plate.I am ecstatic to come back here and try more tacos."
Del Seoul just made an exception and delivered one street north (Newport) of their usual route..... the fries arrived SO FRESH and so did the tacos and bahn mi sandwich..... the kimchi was INCREDIBLE...... I hope they make their delivery zone a little further north so I can order this all the time..... amazing.
"Ok Del Seoul, quasi new kid on the Clark block. I pass you every single day...I've been curious. It was far time to chow down on your eats!I stopped by for lunch last week when out running errands before the Chicago Blizzard 2011. The perfect time to eat in peace. I'm glad this place is within walking distance to me, because parking is not easy in this area..for those of you with the motorized vehicles. It's such a cute tiny little place, so clearly don't bust in here with a huge group and bogart the food. I tried the tacos and I've gotta say, I'm not one for Shrimp Tacos, but they came highly recommended so I had to give it a whirl. I was impressed! The BBQ Pork Taco was succulent and sweet. The Kalbi Taco was good as well. The employees working behind the counter were helpful and friendly. They were eager to know how everything was at the end. Always a nice touch.Welcome to the neighborhood. The eats are delish!"
A perfect example of what quality fast food could be.
THE GOOD: Excellent tacos. Tasty seasoned fries. Clean space. Good customer service. Young. Affordable. THE BAD: Not organicTHE UGLY: Not organic. Should the consider they would certainly shoot up the culinary ladder.
"Korean-Mexican fusion? Intrigued.Went with a friend who knew what to order...Get the kimchi fries and shrimp taco.  Bulgogi bahn sandwich was average-nothing special. nice try. Seoul Dumplings are decent tasting..but not stand out.small portions, tiny place, limited seating, order at the counter.  Cheap food and fast. hop over to molly's cupcakes next door for dessert=D"
"The kalbi and fried shrimp tacos are good, especially because of the cabbage & green onion slaw they put on top which is a like an spicy asian cole slaw with kimchi flavors.  Without the slaw the tacos wouldn't be that great.What I really want to talk about though (and the reason this place gets four stars instead of three and why I yelped it in the first place), is just one menu item which elevates this place to godly status - the PORK BELLY, KIMCHI CHEESE FRIES.  These fries for me are the epitome of food porn.  Over-the-top, cheesy, gooey, porky, fatty sauce on fries that's balanced by the spice and acidity of the kimchi.  If you're a Sriracha fiend like me, drizzle a good helping on top of the fries and you'll end up with basically the most perfect french fry dish ever created.  Poutin ain't got shit on this monster of a culinary masterpiece.This is one of those combinations of flavors I wish I'd thought of.   I was so inspired by these fries that I went home and made mac 'n cheese with chorizo, bacon, and kimchi - which was pretty damn gnarly."
"After much anticipation, we came on a Friday night for some fusion food. Parking in Lincoln park is not easy, especially on a Friday night. We walked over and orderedShrimp taco - the best! Loved the crunchy coated shrimpKalbi taco - goodPork taco - goodKimchi fries - very good. Loved the toppingsKorean dumplings - okI actually enjoyed my tacos enormously. I loved the slaw on top and the marinated meat in between. I have no comparison to other Korean fusion places, but I will come back!"
"Finally came here with three friends on a Saturday. It was way busy, but we got lucky and were able to get a table as soon as we arrived. I got two tacos - the shrimp and the kalbi - in addition to a basket of kimchi fries for the table. The fries were amazing - bits of kimchi smothered in cheese laid on top of crispy fries, topped with green onions. The tacos were superb - the kalbi was a bit too sweet for my taste, but the shrimp was perfect. The shrimp was $2.95 and the kalbi was $2.50, but the tacos were huge in size so it was all worth it.I would probably come back here again when it's not super busy to try the banh-mi. I'm not a fan of ""fusion food"" usually, but this stuff combines everything delicious into awesome ""fast"" food."
"Worthy to be my first review. I love the Bulgogi bahnmi, carbs and meat w/a kick. the bread is light and chewy and the meat's well seasoned. top it all off with some jalapenos and for the size, it's a good deal. and shrimp taco, hello?! so fricken delish.i'm a woman of habit. 1 bulgogi bahnmi and 1 shrimp taco please! =)"
"Loved it.  Buuuut wasn't floored.First impression: those giant flatscreen HD TV menus are pretty bad ass.  Kind of like in Asia, where they use flatscreen HD TVs in completely unnecessary places, like train stations and waiting areas of restaurants and BATHROOMS.Anyway.  I got a Spicy Pork, Spicy Chicken, and Kalbi taco.  My buddy got a Bulgogi Banh Mi sandwich.  I see what you did there, first Korea meets Mexico, then Korea meets Vietnam, hohoho.  Clever clever.The veggies are all the same on the tacos, the only difference being the  meat.  I love veggies, and I think they're good enough to eat by themselves.  The tacos themselves were pretty delicious, but not phenomenal, so no 5 star.  I've had better meats at Korean BBQ places, so maybe that's why it didn't blow me away.The price is pretty good, although maaaybe I'd like to feel fuller paying $8.60 for three tacos.  They're not that large, and Mexican places usually charge about $2 for a taco.  Right? I eat at Mexican places.  I know these things.The sandwich was good.  No complaints on the taste.  If I'm not mistaken tho, usually Banh Mi sandwiches are pretty cheap.  Like $2 in San Diego.  Perhaps a bit pricey, it was about $5 (I think).I believe these originally started in LA, no? Glad to see these fusion foods making their way to Chicago.  I'd go again.  Maybe I'll go in a few days, haha.Also, extra points on the clever restaurant name.  I LOVE puns.  So much, you don't even realize."
"Korean-riffic!!Bf and I decided to grab some take-out last Sunday and a good friend of mine had been raving about this place.....we both love tacos and Asians so thought this place would be perfect for us.....right we were!! We got a couple of the Kalbi beef tacos and spicy BBQ pork tacos and a Bolgogi plate......I was in a serious meat mood so totally dug the beef tacos & the bolgogi......pork tacos were a close second and we will def be back to give the chicken and shrimp a try. We called at noon and our order was ready in 15min.....parking was a bitch...but hey, that's Lincoln Park for ya......service was fast n' friendly and the price is right.....ready for round two!"
"I LOVE this place.  In fact, a friend and I were just debating whether we should ditch our Valentine's Day dinner reservations and come here instead!  We're not going to back out on the original plan, but it sure is tempting.  When we were last here we each had a Diet Coke, split an order of the Kimchi fries (the best -- if you're here, you MUST get them), two chicken tacos and two pork tacos.  Yum.  Yum. Yum.  Total bill = $20. And, Molly's is right down the street for an after dinner cupcake.  :)"
"Absolutely LOVE shrimp tacos. Kalbi tacos are good too! Bf says, sandwiches aren't worth the price. Dumplings are steamed, the meat inside didn't taste too good, we forced ourselves to finish it. LOVE gamjan fries! the aioli dipping sauce is delicious, perfect crispy outside, and perfectly seasoned. I'm not a big fan of kimchi but decided to try the pork belly fries anyway, I'm not quite sure what to make of it yet...I'd try the again, but there's a lot of cheese melted on top. I'd have shrimp tacos allllll day though!"
"Bánh mì? Bánh you imo. After eating lunch at Crisp's and doing some mild walking (in accordance with my active lifestyle), I decided it was time for a second lunch. Well, that's not exactly what happened...I was parked at Wrightwood and Clark, and was planning to go to Red Mango for dessert, but then I realized how close my car was to Molly's and thought a cuppy would be fun. So I did a fake check in at Red Mango to ensure my continued Dukedom and proceeded South down Clark. That's when I noticed Del Seoul and remembered that I like them on facebook for some reason, so I went in and got a spicy shrimp bánh mì, totally foregoing dessert altogether, which I think was a very healthy decision. I'm impressive!"
Spicy Shrimp Taco is incredible! So is the fried fish taco. Amazing value and quick/friendly service.
"Pretty damn good. Just the tacos that is. Go Chicago for finally catching up a little with the west coast. You Go Chicago. I checked it out during lunch and had their kalbi and shrimp taco and kimchi with porkbelly fries. Both tacos were very good with generous veggies on top. Contrary to what another reviewer says- the tacos do NOT contain kimchi. The beef was flavorful and the shrimp- fried and awesome. The fries- I looove soggy fries and these were a tad soggy, ooooo me likey. There was a generous amount of cheese but not enough kimchi and porkbelly. Sad! The pork belly were sliced real thin. No! And not really any actually just lots of cheese but 3 or 4 pieces of small iddy biddy pork. A magnifying glass is needed indeed. Booooooo!! They should call it more accurately cheese fries with green onions. But I remedied what it's lacking (sort of)  by adding minced kimchi I've got at home. Go big or go home I say. So the fries could have used more punch to them with more than just lots of cheese. Oh well. I wouldn't order these again nor recommend them. I'm kinda inspired to make my own with lots more kimchi, hotness and pork belly. Mmmmmmmmmmmm pork belly. Makes my hair nice and lustrous. (this statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration) Especially when cooked with asian flavors. Oh yeah!  I'd come back again for sure to have more tacos and maybe give their banh mi a try."
"I LOVE this place! I used to live on Clark and it was a sad day when I moved away. I went recently and got the shrimp tacos which are phenomenal. Everything is tasty I don't think you can go wrong. The fries are super good too. Seriously you will not leave this place unsatisfied...it's worth it no matter where you are in the city, make the treck you won't be sorry!"
"Del Seoul has a lot of things going for it.....good food, very reasonable prices, and locationally sandwiched somewhere between D.O.C. Wine Bar and Molly's Cupcakes.To start, we wolfed (literally) a plate of the kimchi fries.  So indulgent and delicious, a must if you come here.  I was skeptical, as I'm generally not a fan of kimchi.  But the most prominent flavor in the fries comes from the pork.I ordered the spicy BBQ pork sandwich, and also sampled the dumplings,  shrimp tacos, and kalbi (rib) tacos.  All were very tasty - my favorite was the pork, but then again, I am a huge pork fan, so take that for what it's worth.Anyhow, the space is a bit small, but I will definitely return."
"I really wish I could give 4.5 stars to this restaurant, as it is nearly a WHOOO HOOO! AS GOOD AS IT GETS!  Unfortunately, it is not quite up to par with my other 5 star reviews, and I don't want to look like a dude who is totally psyched about everything no matter what.Nevertheless, it is a great place to go on Sunday afternoon if you're craving light spice and asian-mexican fusion (not unique by any means, but extremely well done and unique for the neighborhood).  I've only tried the spicy pork bahn mi, the kalbi tacos, and the both of which are incredible.  The tacos have some sort of sesame oil cabbage slaw on them that lights up the taste buds, especially in combination with some of the best, if not the best, marinated kalbi in the city that I've had to date, all served on doubled-up corn tortillas.  If you love sriracha or hot sauce, you can throw some on, but sometimes it's better to just enjoy the less spicy flavors and save the spice for other dishes.If you're with a team, go for the kimchi fries.  I mean, it's french fries that are covered in kimchi that's covered in pork belly that's covered in cheese that's capped off with a dollop of sour cream.  Pretty disgustingly decadent, which is why you should probably share.For me and a friend, the perfect order has been 2 kalbi tacos (1 each), split a spicy pork bahn mi, and split a kimchi fries.  That's a lot of food and fat, which is why it's a sunday afternoon save-me-from-this-terrible-feeling/treat-myself-­to-greasy-comfort-food kind of deal.Love it,Deuce"
Del Seoul hit the spot for a my craving of something filling and delicious. The place is a bit small with just a few tables. My bf and I were starving and opted to get the food to go rather than wait around for a table. I got 2 tacos- the kalbi (beef short rib) and the shrimp taco. He got the BBQ pork sandwich and we shared an order of the dumplings. The place was pretty hectic on a Saturday afternoon during lunchtime but the food came out relatively quick. Everything we ordered was AWESOME. The tacos had great flavor. I had a bite of the pork sandwich and it was deelish- even the bread was good. I will definitely be back!
Oh Del Seoul how i miss thee.  I was in Chi Town a couple of weeks ago and was in the mood for Korean BBQ.I  stumbled accross Del Seoull while strolling through lincoln park.  Kilbi and bulgogi tacos!!!!!??? and Kimchi Fries.  Oh there is a heaven.  I came here with 4 buddies and everything was great.  really wish there was a place in Boston like Del Seoul. I'll be back i can promise you that.AMAZING!!! DING
"Finally tried the Kimchi fries, and they were spectacular."
"Finally Korean Tacos are here people!!! This place opened in the neighborhood few months ago and you can tell that it's not just the initial ""hype and buzz"" that's keeping them going. Their food is fresh, affordable and unique.  I love their sesame shrimp and bbq pork tacos!!!  I am yet to try their pork khimchi fries as I have heard great things about it. Yes, I am not ashamed to say it...but I am in a shrimp and pork taco state of mind!!! I have gone back several several  times in the past few months and that's all I have ever ordered coz I just cant get enough!!!  Overall -  4 words. FIVE STARS FOR SURE!!"
"the banh mi has a little too much mayo on the bread for my liking, but the cilantro and daikon were fresh and added some much-needed vegetables to my diet. the shrimp at del seoul is delicious and flavorful.the tacos are good, topped with fresh greens lightly dressed with a korean vinaigrettethe kimchi fries are good, but they're rich and sort of heavy, so get them to share with some friends.nice korean-mexican fusion joint"
"Thank God we finally get some decent Korean in Lincoln Park and don't have to drive up to Lincolnwood / Lawrence / K-town to get some Bulgogi up in this b**tch!  Fact: Kimchi is in the world's top 10 healthiest foods and it's served with every entree here.  Packed with fiber, vitamins, antioxidants...no wonder Asian women age well.Only 3 things I get here as a true Seoul brotha:  Bulgogi / Daegigogi (beef/pork) plate, Shrimp Ban Mi, and the Kimchi Fries.  Winner winner Kim-chi dinner! Try the mondu( dumplings) and BiBimBop (Korean Fried Rice) and the Tacos, but the first 3 are guaranteed deliciousness.  Closest thing to LA k-town food in Chi-town! Now, to find a good Sul-rung tang / Cha Chiang Myun place in Lincoln park...hmm"
"Get here early and get a table before you order. Bahn Mi or Tacos, get the Bulgogi at all costs! So sweet, jiucy, and tender. Bursting with Flavor.The kimchi fries were a disappointment as they lacked in kimnchi and pork belly. Good idea but needs better execution.The shrimp in the sesame-chili taco were almost non-existent as there were only 2 tiny shrimp.I will be back for more Bulgogi and to try the other plates!"
"i don't know why i find it so irritating when you're sitting at a small table and you order food, and  when they bring it to you and look at you (somewhat impatiently, i might add) to rearrange the table so they can set the food down on the tiny little table. like, when did i become a master space organizer with the teeny little table you give me?   well, i guess i can overlook it as the food was really good.  we ordered a sampling of items--the bulgogi banh mi; the kalbi, pork and shrimp tacos; the stone bowl bibimbop, the kimchi fries and the dumplings. OKAY, yeah, i know we ordered a lot.  but we need to sample everything!  i have no complaints whatsoever about the food.  it was awesome.  i wish i lived closer. i would eat there everyday.  correction.  i would order it and take it home to eat.  :)"
"I got Seoul but I'm not a Seouljah! Sign me up... I want to be a Korean Street Food Fighter! Del Seoul is hooking up Chicago with a heaping dose of KBBQ yummy and I'm super on board with this brand of absolutely appetizing and accessible eat 'n go deliciousness. Think of any relatively standard small storefront where you order at the counter, sit at a smattering of only 6 or so tables, get your taco/banh mi/bibimbop/kimchi fix on and then get on yer way. Super no-frills but perfection nonetheless. Besides, who doesn't love a little kalbi (Korean for grilled short rib fabulousness) with their Saturday afternoon shopping efforts? I sure did. While the overflowing Banh Mi sandwiches and hearty BiBimBop specialties looked positively amazing, I was here for Mission: Tacos (uh, and pork belly fries) and not much else. Went with a lovely trio of Kalbi, Spicy BBQ Pork and and Sesame-Chili Shrimp tacos. Mmmm... mmmm.... meaty! Especially loved the super flavorful beef kalbi and mildly spicy, moist BBQ pork best. The meat here is cooked with not only skill, but some good down home family love and it comes through in taste-bursting spades! I came to find all four taco options are served on doubled up white corn tortillas and topped with Del Seoul's signature Secret Slaw and Chili Garlic ""Salsa"". While the sauce is a thing of tangy beauty and the slaw is crunchy, refreshing and filling, it does provide for a bit of redundancy in taste and texture from taco to taco. The only revolving component in these tacos is the protein you choose and all else is static. After awhile they run the risk of sort of blending together a bit... would love to see an addition of different toppings and sauces to differentiate each one and highlight its particular flavor a bit more successfully. Service was lovely and honest... both adorable counter gals requested feedback after we'd polished off our meal and were curious to know what our favorite dishes were. Well, the Spicy BBQ Pork taco and insanely ridiculous must-have Kimchi and Pork Belly Fries smothered in melted cheddar and jack cheeses, sour cream, sesame seeds, scallions, caramelized kimchi (wow!), roasted pork belly and onions, natch! Will definitely be back and can't wait to see how Del Seoul evolves as their popularity remains on the steady rise. Another Quick Tasty Tip: The Seoul Street Style Dumplings are the secret underground phenomenon of the menu. Delicate, delicious, handmade and chock-full of all things amazing, these are not to be missed!!!"
"Chi-town, when are we finally going to have decent food trucks?  If you are looking for delicious Korean tacos, look no further because you will not find anything this delicious on wheels here in the Chi.I loved the sesame chili shrimp tacos and bulgogi, but was not a huge fan BBQ pork or BBQ chicken.  The kimchi fries are delicious especially with pork belly!  And if you're not in the mood for tacos, the banh mi's are just as good especially with bulgogi.The space is super small and cramped so I suggest carry-out, and enjoy your Korean fusion food in the comfort of your own home!  Del Seoul, you always hit the spot.  Thanks!"
"Ordered the bulgogi banh mi sandwich, which is essentially a Korean version of an Italian beef sub. It was on a really nice baguette bread, crispy outside, warm doughy inside. The meat itself was served thinly sliced and warm. Very juicy and flavorful. Came with pickled daikon, carrots, cucumber, and onion with a roasted red pepper aioli. The over all flavor was savory beyond belief. Watch out for the jalapenos though, they will get you!Tiny a place, only a few tables. You order at the counter and they bring the food in a basket. Casual date place, if you can get a table. You can carryout or call in though.Next time, I will order with a side of fries. They look awesome! This place is well worth the buzz it has been getting."
"Great tacos!All are tasty, especially the shrimp.Love the shredded, lettuce/cabbage topping.Kim-Chiese Fries are interesting...feel too guilty eating them.Dumplings are pretty good as well.Will definitely go out of my way to get some of these tacos!"
"Fast, delicious & cheap. If you haven't heard Korean tacos are here and they're amazing.Last night was my first experience at Del Seoul and I was floored, trying the spicy BBQ pork & the fried fish taco. Del Seoul was able to combine the wonders of Korean BBQ with the simplicity of the mexican taco format.If you like tacos you're gonna love Korean tacos!"
Came here with friends and I thought the food here was decently priced and pretty delicious. I especially loved the korean beef tacos---and would highly recommend that one. The shrimp taco and the fish taco was also really good. The fish is deep fried and so crispy---and it's a pretty decently sized piece of fish as well. We also got the kim-chi fries which were yum as well. I would recommend sharing the kim-chi fries split between 4 people as we ordered 2 order of it split between all 4 of us and it was a LOT of food. Would most likely come here again for the tacos sometime in the future.
Korean BBQ was awesome. Taco favor was unique. I had first time Korean taco. It is yummy.
"Overview:  This place rocks!  The food is fantastic and inexpensive, and the location is perfect for people watching on the street.  Plus, you can buy their kimchi by the jar and bring it home :)  I was skeptical at first about the Mexican-Korean fusion, but it really works!  If I lived closer to this restaurant, I'd probably eat here at least once a week.Food:  I had the kalbi taco and bahn mi and my boyfriend had the kalbi platter ... everything we ordered was flavorful and delicious!  We also got a big jar of kimchi - it was good, but not fermented for as long as I would have liked - I like kimchi when it is fermented enough to be a little sour (sounds gross, huh).Atmosphere:  It has more of a fast food place vibe than a cafe vibe to it - there are comfy seats to sit in and eat, but it's a little drafty by the windows in the winter.Service:  Great!  They brought our food to our table and were quick and polite."
"we tried all types of taco, kimchi fries, and kaibi plate. These were for 3 people and we had tons of food left. If you plan to order appetizers to share (e.g. fries or dumpling), 2 tacos per person would be perfect portion. All tacos are good. My favorite one is shrimp and kalbi. The slaw and pickled red onion that came with fish taco was great. Kalbi plate was at par as what you can find from more authentic korean restaurants."
"Korean-BBQ-style Tacos?! This was the first place I had ever consumed such a thing.I felt like I had betrayed my longtime friend...RICE.Nevertheless, it worked out.  I consumed the following:-Kalbi Taco-Spicy BBQ Pork Taco-Kimchi & Pork Belly FriesYou walk up to the counter, place your order, and they give you a number to post at your table so they can bring you the food just like at Culver's or Corner Bakery.  Bottled / canned drinks are available...along with bags of asian chips.  They also sell jars of kimchi.  Unlimited Sriracha also available.TACOS:The tacos were very tasty!  I preferred the pork taco over the Kalbi taco. The marinated meat, the cilantro-onion relish, and the slaw came together really well. The slaw had a fresh crunch to it.  I definitely have to try the shrimp taco next time.KIMCHI&PORKBELLY FRIES:As for the KimchiPorkBelly Fries...I wasn't a huge fan.The best way I can describe the taste is...imagine eating a baked potato with a lil butter 'n salt, topped with sour cream and chives...(sounds good right?) ...now throw kimchi and melted cheese on top along with chopped up grilled pork.  Definitely a weird combo. It had an odd flavor profile. I feel like they used the words ""pork belly"" as a hype.  Regardless of whether or not the pork is indeed pork belly, I felt like the title was unwarranted in this case, if not borderline misleading.Considering it's Korean BBQ style meat, I'd say it is priced very well.Usually when I eat Korean BBQ I end up spending at least $15-$20.Here, you can get 3 KoreanBBQ Tacos for only $7.50!!!  And the food came quickly. Definitely a fan!"
"I had take out from Del Seoul with a few friends yesterday, and overall we were huge fans.  We each had a different favorite dish, too, which I think speaks to the strength of the menu as a whole.My personal favorite was the chili shrimp taco.  The shrimp itself is surprisingly well cooked, and the sauce is sweet and spicy and tangy.  Mmm.  Wonderful.  It was the perfect combination of Korean and Latin.  Other favorites were the beef taco and the fish taco.  The shrimp banh mi was also fabulous.The downsides were the chicken (in both the taco and the banh mi) and the fries.  I thought the fries themselves were nothing special, and the garlic sesame ""aioli"" was just mayonnaise with some sesame seeds on top.  Still, none of those items is on the ""recommended"" list, and I suspect that they were just added to appeal to the less adventurous eaters that are bound to wander into any Lincoln Park restaurant.Overall really really yummy food for an excellent price.   I will definitely be back frequently."
The kimchi fries are amazing!! This place is so good! The beef short ribs plate is also top notch!I highly recommend this really tasty korean/latino fusion.
"Lots of good choices here.  I would say the taco's are the best way to ingest their delicious proteins.  And of those, even for you shrimp non believers out there, the shrimp is the best.  Its crunchy and spicy.  They seem to still be updating the menu too!  Worth a few trips to this."
"omnomnom. All the tacos are really good. My favorite is the Sesame-Chili Shrimp.. ugh so perfect.There was a lot of things I wanted to try but it adds up quickly. $$$$$Kimchi fries are pretty good, very big portion.. definitely could split between 2. I wouldn't say they're like OMGOMGOMGGETINMYBELLY tho.:)"
"I am Seoul'd. The pork belly and kimchi fries look and taste like they should be on ThisIsWhyYoureFat.com, but ohhhhhhh, believe me, you will SO enjoy blowing your caloric budget on this. Who knew the simple French fry could be so loftily elevated? Order the spicy BBQ pork taco. And the kalbi beef short rib taco. The flavours are fresh, spicy, and GOOD. At the end of my meal, I was wishing that I had been born with 3 stomachs, but alas... there was no more Del Seoul to be had. It's okay, there's always dinner."
"It is one of favorite places in the city.  When i first started going to DS i would only order the sandwiches, which are amazing.  The short rib and the shrimp sandwiches are great.  One can easily walk around with them to check out Lincoln Park Zoo or check out the city.  The tacos are where its at.  You have to get the three tacos of fish, shrimp and short rib.  You will not go wrong.  I can not get enough of them.  They  also have plates that are sizzling hot with rice, onions and bak choy and comes with your choice of meat.  I suggest the pork plate. Very generous portions and quality ingredients make this dish great.  I also suggest go with a group and everyone tries everyones.  You won't be disappointed.  Enjoy!"
"To borrow the title from De La Soul's infamous ""Me, Myself and I"" song, here are the 3 versions of April critiquing their items at the new and evergrowing Del Seoul.Me:  Me had the pleasure of tasting the kalbi taco.  The grilled beef was sweet, succulent, but still had a nice firmness to it holding well in the taco.  Pieces were small enough for easy consumption, but not tiny, and there was a reasonable portion size given. The kicker, and the surprising contender....was the secret slaw.  What looked like ordinary cabbage, was in fact NOT.  Me was half expecting it to not have much flavor, but truth be told, while it may have dressed up the taco, it held its own with its crispness and crunchiness, and held even better with the chili sauce dressing it nicely. No sogginess whatsoever. Me loved the chili sauce which had a nice amount of both heat and garlic.  Myself:  Myself griped that she wanted to be the one to try the shrimp taco.  Myself got her way and happily dug into the well filled seafood goodness.  Seafood is in fact her favorite, so she ate slowly to savor every single bite.  The shrimp itself had an added kick of heat, in addition to the chili sauce that accompanies each of their tacos so beware of the heat factor for those who have a low tolerance for spiciness (rookies!!!)  The shrimp had a WONDERFUL crispy texture, were plump and juicy, and fried to the perfect firmness.I:  I got stuck with the gamja fries.  Me and Myself didn't know what they were missing as I had the whole basket to myself.  Fries could've been a tad bit crispier, but that was because it would hold better with the garlic-y mayo condiment.  Yum-o.  Tasty.  Delicious.  Anything with garlic is I's friend.  After half the basket, I realized that the fries were missing something, something acidic to cut the creaminess of the aioli.  Maybe a dash of vinegar or malt vinegar.  It was I's personal preference, so maybe just a small suggestion, but certainly may not be something everyone would enjoy.  Dinner mate has no tolerance for heat or spiciness.  Although she ordered the kalbi taco, she couldn't take the heat factor from the chili garlic sauce, so she settled on her 8 piece dumplings.  For $6, 8 pieces were a steal!!!! Me, Myself and I were surprised that the 7 pieces filled her as her meal, as ""we"" stole a piece to sample the goodies.  She said they were sooo good served warm and could tell they were handmade and not at all from a bag from the frozen section of H Mart.  Score!  They were filled with nicely flavored pork, as she and ""we"" both noted that the dough had the perfect thickness and consistency.  Served on a steamer, this was such a great touch, both aesthetically and to keep the dumplings fresh and warm up until they were eaten.  Find a table fast when you arrive, this place gets PACKED during peak dinner times.  We'd suggest you have one person order the food, while the other saves/finds a table.  Service was swift and they brought the items to your table.  The staff are super nice and don't show any signs of ""we just opened, please forgive us as we try to get the kinks out of our system"".  They ran the business quite smoothly and you can tell they were all in sync!  Highly recommend!!!!!"
"ok this place has improved since it opened. when i first started coming here it was a hit or miss. i came back here with my sister and understand now why this place has become a staple chow spot for her. Pros:4 tacos. and we split a coconut juice. i had kalbi beef and bbq chicken. she had bbq chicken and sesame chili shrimp. the corn tortilla was loaded with the goods. delicious. i am pondering how to emulate it.Cons: 4 tacos, and we split a coconut juice. came out to $15! now normal tacos are half the price or even less in the woods where i am spoiled. $15 isn't outrageous for lunch by any means but for a few tacos?! i can get 4 tacos and a coconut juice in pilsen for $5. soooo im pondering how to emulate it."
"Ever since I first got wind of this place a few months ago I have been waiting ever (not) so patiently for it to finally open. I was lucky enough though to attend one of their preview tastings before they officially opened and have been back twice already. ^_^  It is definitely worth checking out. In three visits I was able to try the chicken taco, pork banh mi, shrimp banh mi, bibimbap, pork taco, pork belly kimchi fries, shrimp taco, kalbi taco, and dumplings. I enjoyed all of the tacos with the exception of the kalbi taco because I felt it was a little too sweet for my own liking, the actual meat was good so I'm sure others would enjoy it if they don't mind the sweetness. I actually didn't think I would like the shrimp taco that much but I think it might be my favorite of the four. I also really enjoyed both the pork and chicken taco and I love the freshness and crunchiness of the cabbage and lettuce they pile on the tacos along with that yummy dressing they use. I also really enjoyed the pork banh mi.  I've actually never had a real Veitnamese banh mi before so I can't really compare the two but I can say that it was probably one of the most delicious sandwiches I have ever had. The shrimp was good as well but I felt it was bit too heavy for my liking with the shrimp being breaded and fried and the creamy sauce/aioli spread on it.  If I ever get that one again I might ask them to go light with the aioli.The kimchi pork belly fries were good and definitely worth trying but I think that it is priced way too high for what you actually get in comparison to the other items on the menu and for that alone I likely will not be getting those again. The bimbimbap was okay and I think my ambivalence towards it is because I am Korean and it's something so ubiquitous and common that it just was not special to me.  I can say that the veggis they use are really fresh and very tasty and it is definitely worth getting if you have little experience with or exposure to Korean food. And finally the dumplings were also very good, I would recommend though that you eat those first while they are still hot because they get a little hard and rubbery as they cool..."
"What can I say, it's like eating korean food, but in a taco. The food was delicious. We had the tacos, korean dumplings and kimchi fries with pork belly. Enough said. They were all marvelous. The only downside of the place is it's horrible layout. They could fit way more people in there if they rearrange the table.  A lot of customers were frustrated with how it works when I went there. You have to line up to order, FIND YOUR TABLE first then tell them or else they won't start cooking your order. My boyfriend ordered take home so we'd get the food and I roamed around for tables. We would definitely go back there again when the weather is warmer so we can just eat on the sidewalk or something, for sure! It's so good, cheap. What else can a girl ask for."
"I ordered all four tacos: chicken, beef, pork and shrimp. If I closed my eyes I wouldn't be able to tell you the difference because they all taste the same. My friend ordered the shrimp sandwich and barley got any shrimp. Why can't you guys be more creative and unique with the tacos. The same slaw on every taco!!!!!! They are all way too sweet anyway. The price is right! The flavor is wrong! What a HYPE! Will I return? NO!"
"Great value, fast and friendly service and, most importantly, excellent food.  Short rib, grilled pork, or spicy shrimp tacos are just $2.50 and damn filling. The husband and I stopped in while running errands and grabbed 3 tacos (two for him and one for me) and an order of the amzing dumplings and walked out full and happy. The meat is perfectly tender, the shrimp was oh so spicy good, and the dumplings are soft and flavorful. I do wish each taco has a different set of toppings, but otherwise, this place is near perfection for a quick, tasty and cheap meal."
"I don't know it is a real Korean restaurant because I feel the food there is a little bit different from other Korean restaurants.However, I think their food is pretty good. I ordered the Bibimbop, and there are many vegetables and meat more than I expected. The taste is great. I saw many people have Korean tacos. They look delicious as well.I will definitely try that next time!"
"I attended the soft opening, and while I only had two dishes (the vegetarian bibimbap and home-made kimchi) I was impressed. The bibimbap was super filling. The marinated vegetables were so delicious, especially the beansprouts, spinach, and mushrooms. As for the kimchi, it's also good. Slightly spicy and crisp. Mix it in with the bibimbap and you're golden.Right this moment, there are not too many vegetarian options, but the owners promise they will add some more to their menu. Regardless, vegetarians have a few things to eat here. Check it out if you're in the 'hood."
The Sesame Chili Shrimp sandwich is amazing!
"I might be the first yelper to give this place only 2 stars. But here's why...The Kogi Truck craze in LA has been written in every credible food mag around, and it specializes in korean tacos.  Everyone rants and raves about it from coast to coast, even naming the chef of the Kogi Truck as one of the next up and coming chefs of 2010.  After reading all about this guy, I'm already skeptical...it's just tacos, people! How good can they be?Since I can't be in Cali, I was uber-excited to see that a korean taco joint had opened in my hometown!  I went to this restaurant expecting to be blown away by the korean taco craze and unfortunately I wasn't.We ordered a few tacos: kalbi, spicy chicken, and sesami-chili shrimp. Then we ordered the bulgogi banh mi, and the pork belly/kimchi fries.So the most disappointing one was the pork belly/kimchi fries.  The pork belly was barely there - thin little strips of pork belly that you had to search through melted cheese to find.  And when eaten by itself, the pork belly did not have much flavor. The kimchi on the other hand was very tasty and definitely tasted homemade, but the quantity of kimchi was lacking. I should have been able to have a bite of kimchi with every fry, but that was not the case.The tacos were acceptable.  The flavor of the meat was ok.  The tastiest part of the taco was the well-dressed lettuce - a little spicy and a little tangy, and definitely fresh and crunchy. I wished that they used a different vegetable, instead of romaine lettuce. Maybe cabbage or something more interesting.  In addition, I expected the chicken and shrimp to be spicier since they are both labeled as ""spicy.""  Also they all seemed to be missing a ""special"" spicy sauce of some kind.  Just leaving out bottles of Sarachi sauce doesn't seem to do it.The banh mi was good. It's all about the bread with the banh mi and this bread was soft on the inside and crusty on the outside - perfect. The sandwich itself was good but not impressive.Maybe I expected too much...next time we'll have to fly to LA to get our Korean Taco fix."
"Considering the number of reviews, let's get right down to business:1. The shrimp taco was AWESOME. The flavor of the shrimp was great, and they were a decent size. Too bad there was only two of them! But I guess they couldn't cram more in there considering the tortilla size. But they were good, and the pile of toppings was full of tasty.2. The dumplings were...okay.Not nearly as good as I hoped they would be. I would pass on them the next visit in order to try a sammich or fries.3. The place was crowded, but people seem to be good about leaving once their meal was done instead of sitting around yaking while people wait to sit.4. Very friendly wait service and the place was very clean. I wish the drink case had been better organized though so I could decide if I wanted a fancy imported Asian drink or not."
"It was refreshing to try a restaurant that serve food by combining two cultures together. Taco and Kimchi and it works! The magic it offers is amazing. My friend and I ordered Kalbi taco, spicy BBQ pork taco and the Kimchi fries. It blends together pretty well. I especially like the Kimchi fries a lot. The portion I got was big and it was tasty. I cannot wait to visit this place again in the near future"
"Stopped here with my girlfriend and I was impressed with our meal. We split a order of dumplings and their Bibimbop (a rice bowl with a mix of ribeye steak and veggies). It was plenty for the both of us. I liked it because it had alot of FLAVOR and was unique. Definitely a solid meal. I'll be back Del Soul.  Looking forward to try your korean infused tacos. If your looking to try something a little bit different for dinner or lunch, check out this place!"
"SHRIMP TACOS!!!!  Sorry, didn't mean to shout, but, DAMN, are they good.I would eat here every single day of the week if I lived close by.  Granted, I work very close, but I try not to work 7 days a week.The food here is fantastic.  The dumplings, for me, left a little to be desired; the texture was not to my liking.  I digress.  Try everything on the menu, you will not be disappointed.  Call ahead if your going to do carryout, it's a lot quicker.  There's not a lot of seating if you're dining in, but the food and the wait is worth it.SHRIMP TACOS!!!!"
"Holy meat sandwich. This place is the shiz. So good that I don't even mind adding an extra 20 minutes onto my lunch break in order to drive over and get my fix. The bulgogi is everything i could want for in a meal. Crunchy, tender, sweet, spicy (add chili paste), and affordable to boot. The only reason that it didn't get 5 stars is that I was not that impressed with the tacos. The bf and I did a flight of them, and the toppings seemed to mask the meat and got a bit monotonous considering the same mix topped each taco. On the bright side, the pillowy savory dumplings were the stuff dreams are made of. Check-ch-check it out."
"I've tried to resist the kalbi taco phenomenon, since the idea really doesnt sound too appealing. I like my tacos from a cart, with some onions, cilantro and lime. Korean BBQ in a taco sounds insane. Only fools develop opinions of the unknown, so I decided to to give it a shot. The venue is plain and simple, with LCD menus(i like) The menu itself is interesting, and combines Korean, mexican, and vietnamese cuisines. I've tried all the tacos, and they are all pretty damn good. The sesame shrimp stands out as the clear winner. It is delicious. If you are waiting for the 911 heartattack bus route, the pork belly kimchi fries will get you there a few years early. They really are good though. The kimchi could be a bit more potent..some other menu items are pretty average, and take a while to prepare. Stick with the items that sound adventurous.The tipping policy is a bit fuzzy. You order at the counter, but they bring you your food. Some people take their food and throw it away, others leave it. The staff is affirmative in reminding you that chopsticks and silverware are up front and you may ""help yourself"". To tip or not to tip? who knows. I like del seoul"
"2 beef tacos, 2 pork tacos, and kimchi with pork belly fries = $18.A little overpriced for what it was. The flavors were ok. The first time I had kogi tacos (tacos using Korean marinated meats) in LA, I was blown away. I went home and my friend and I tried to create our own version. Not as good as the LA tacos, but still pretty good. I preferred our homemade version over the tacos at Del Seoul. I wouldn't have been as disappointed if they were cheaper.The fries were ok, but definitely needs more kimchi. The pork belly was pretty sparse as well.I'll try it again some other time just to check out the other menu items and if it impresses me the second time around, I'll update my review."
"Food couldn't get any better.  Tacos are amazing, my favorites are definitely the shrimp and kalbi.  And the fries!!! The gamja fries are crispy, tasty, and perfect with the aioli sauce.  They're always busy now, but the food still comes out fairly quick.  I always bring out-of-towners here and they fall in love.  So happy that I live 5 minutes away...I'll be back again soon."
"This place is great for quick, tasty food.  I've tried the chicken, beef, pork, and shrimp tacos and I really can't comment on a favorite, they're ALL delicious.  One taco uses two small tortillas but they fill them with so much of the ingredients you could probably make two tacos if you wanted.  The french fries with garlic aioli were seasoned well and perfectly crispy.Solid lunch restaurant."
I was so excited to come here to finally try this place and was disappointed..... Maybe I would have liked the kalbi tacos instead...but I heard from people I know that like the shrimp one more so that's what I tried.We went right around 12pm around the time it opened so it was not busy at all. No high chairs FYI but kids can go on the booths.Sesame-Chili Shrimp Taco: I feel like the proportions were off. Too many veggies and just like a bit of shrimp. I think I would have liked it if it was less veggies and they used little shrimp instead. It was kinda dry too.Kimchi Fries: Pretty good but I think I would rather just get cheese fries.
"Delicious kimchi fries! I thought it was weird when I saw it on the menu but its spicy, cheesy, and delicious. The dumplings are good too.I got the shrimp and galbi taco. I would have liked the galbi if the meat was cut up smaller so it would be easier to eat. Either way the shrimp one was delicious and definitely my favorite. Good thing I live far or else my calories would be consistently coming from this place."
"Lets be serious! I live an hour and half away and I will make special weekend trips down to Chicago for one of their Kalbi tacos and Kimchi fries! My goodness, it is amazing here. I will meet up with my past university friends here for the purpose of catching up and we all sit in silence as we are 100% focused on the delicious yumminess we are filling our stomachs with! Afterwards, it doesn't really matter what we do - because I am so happy and satisfied knowing that the long trip... was TOTALLY worth it! Thank you Del Seoul! Keep up the good work."
"Glad the restaurant expanded.  More seating but still crowded.  Only means one thing, the food here is a hit!Absolutely loved everything I tried.  Highly recommend the fried fish taco.  On point!  Chili shrimp taco, scrumptious.  Got my surf, need the turf.  Kalbi beef taco, excellent.  Want to try:  Kimchi fries and Seoul Style Street Dumplings.  A guaranteed smile.  Go, now!"
"This spot is nice when you're bored with Mickey D's and just want fast food with an asian twist. However, this isn't a mindblowing foodie fest - just a simple straightforward casual spot for a quick bite to eat. I came with a friend that's already been here a few times, so we ordered what we already knew would be good. - My fav  was the Kimchee Fries - this is really original and a very tasty representation of asian fusion. A sizeable gooey steaming platter of fries with a kick in flavor.- The shrimp taco, according to my friend, is the only taco that's good here-agreed. I thought it was good and tasty, but not memorable.-The Seoul Dumplings were also pretty good - tasty but not like one of those original/memorable dishes -much like any chinese type of dumplings you can buy frozen. But yummy for the hungry belly. Good filler dish if you're hungry and need something else to fill you up. -my friends also ordered the Vietnamese sandwich but i can't comment cuz i'm not a fan of those types of sandwiches to begin with. They said it was just ok."
"The best shrimp tacos ever! I love the wings, better than any wings anywhere. One of my top 3 restaurants"
everything is so goooood~ try all the tacos. stone bowl bi-bim-bop is great along with soo-doo-boo. Better than more expensive korean restaurant!
"After checking my google maps on my BB for the umpteenth time (thanks to the anxiety ridden bf...""NO, babe, we HAVEN'T passed it yet""), I come to find out it's right by Toro, Molly's AND Aloha Eats.  Holy hell...tastebud overload!Anywhooo...we wanted to ""taste"" a bit of everything so we ordered: kalbi and spicy bbq pork tacos, sesame chili shrimp banh mi, kimchi and pork belly fries.  If tasting meant gobbling everything down in seconds, then that's what we did ;P  Everything was delish....all the flavors went together perfectly.  But, I LOVED the kimchi pork belly fries!!  They also carried some Asian snacks (honey crisps are worth trying) and drinks to complete your dining experience. Small dining area but the turnover that day was fast (it was a weekday lunch though).  Parking just plain sucks around this area so be prepared."
"I would give this place 3.5 is possible.Since it is one of the first Korean tacos in Chicago, I give it an additional star.The shrimp tacos were outstanding. The Kalbi were ok.I thought too much stuff was put on them making them harder to eat.I've had better Korean tacos elsewhere, but not in Chicago."
"I'm officially a fan of this dive-y Korean/Asian restaurant! Del Seoul offers more than just Korean cuisine. I tried their sesame chili shrimp sandwich which was called a ""banh mi"", a supposedly Vietnamese creation. It was soooooo good! The veggies were very tasty and went very well with the creamy slightly spicy sauce called sesame-chili Aioli. I couldn't get enough of the fresh shrimp which had exceptional texture and flavors. I added some Sriracha sauce and it was very yummy. One let down was the bread, I thought it was a bit too chewy.My friend had the hot stone bowl bibimbop and he absolutely loved it. I had a bite of the crispy rice from the bottom of the bowl and it was so good with the rest of the the ingredients and their special sauce.We however did not like the kimchi fries at all. I had the best kimchi fries when I was in Austin so I had pretty high expectations when ordering Del Seoul's, which was humongous BTW. Now that I am looking at some pictures that people took at Del Seoul and I am willing to think that it was only because last night they were so busy they were a little bit sloppy at making ours. There weren't enough kimchies and the cheese was not flowy enough to cover most of the fries. Although I won't try kimchi fries again, I am definitely going to revisit this place and the next one I will try is their fish taco!"
"What happens when a Korean and a Mexican get married?A KOREAN EXPLOSION OF TACO IN MY MOUTH!!!Thats what!What an amazing lunch!  I will be back soon, and more than once!Even though I had the chicken, pork, and shrimp tacos, steamed dumplings, pork belly fries, and a pork banh mi, I still wanted more!  Yeah... I was full, but man did we eat!!Go, RUN, now!  you will love it!"
"I need to go back already.  I've been looking forward to trying Del Seoul for a while.  I finally got the opportunity but it was unfortunate for me that I was still a little full from lunch a few hours before!  Basically, my condition kept me from trying the Kim Chi fries since the portion looked overwhelming.I did have room to try a Kalbi Taco and a Shrimp Taco.  I was also lucky that my friend was willing to share at least the Gamja Seasoned Fries.The tacos were outstanding.  Both  the kalbi and shrimp were very flavorful.  The kalbi was at a good tenderness and the shrimp were nice and crispy from being fried.  I was told not to take it home to avoid them getting soggy.  Good tip!  My only criticism is that the tacos were overloaded with lettuce which made spilling inevitable.The Gamja fries were cooked very well.  Their crisp was basically perfect; not overdone or soggy.  They were well seasoned as they should be.  I enjoyed them by themselves but their aioli brings the experience to a whole new level.  In fact, my friend was eating the aioli without the fries at one point.The restaurant itself is pretty small.  I hear it usually gets busy but I guess I chose a great time to go (Monday at 6:00pm).  Service was pretty quick.  You order at the counter, grab a number, and they bring your order to where you're sitting.The menu also includes their take on Bahn Mi as well as some rice dishes.  If there's anything I have to return for though, it's the Kim Chi fries!"
"Previously, I've never heard of korean tacos, more or less this restaurant. My friend and I wanted to have brunch within the Lincoln Park neighborhood, somewhere new and cheap and found Del Seoul on Yelp. I ordered the Kalbi (Grilled beef short rib) taco for $2.95 and my friend had the Kalbi, Sesame-Chili shrimp and Sambal fish tacos. I'm quite a small eater, so sad but true. But I really liked the juicy taste of the beef and the combinations of cilantro, onion and toasted sesame inside it. My friend couldn't be bothered to take small bites of his tacos. It was funny to watch him savor every bite and gobble up 3 tacos so quickly. We definitely give an extra star rating for the reasonable pricing of the foods and its great location, conveniently located within walking distance to the boutiques, restaurants and other bars."
"A Korean taco place?! Might sound strange at first but after trying the creations at Del Seoul you'll have a hard time not daydreaming about the food. Essentially Del Seoul is a Korean/Vietnamese/Mexican fusion place. They have tacos and bahn mi sandwiches filled with delicious Korean meats like kalbi, bulgogi, spicy BBQ pork/chicken, and sesame-chili shrimp. Pair that with either the seasoned gamja fries or kimchi fries w/pork belly and you're taste buds will be thoroughly happy."
"I tried the samba fish, kalbi, spicy pork bbq and sesame chili shrimp taco. Everything was delicious! Not sure which was my favorite because they all tasted good in their unique way. The Bulgogi sandwhich was really good too but comparable to other areas. Go for the tacos! Love their prices too. You can't go wrong with this place!"
"Overall the place was slightly above average. I had the shrimp taco, kalbi taco and street dumplings. I was not that impressed with the Shrimp taco. It was good but the batter was too thick and it seemed more like fried shrimp you get with chinese carry out. Not the flavor but the texture. The Kalbi taco was amazing. I would say one of my favorites. The slaw on top is really really good and it would make a great salad! Had I just had three of these I would have given another star. The dumplings were average in my opinion. Ambience was ok but nothing to write home about. I would have also enjoyed a beer. The flavors are very good and I will be back to try the Bibimbap and Bahn mi."
"Last night I cheated and I wanted to feel guilty about it, but I just couldn't.  I cheated on my one true love, Crisp.  My boyfriend discovered Crisp FOREVER ago, and it is my go to for comfort food.  However...Del Seoul is now in the running.  We went there around 6pm on a Sunday and there was a bit of a line, but nothing worth complaining over.  We ordered two of the Kalbi Tacos, one spicy pork, one spicy chicken.  We also got an order of the kimchi fries & street dumplings.The only negative thing about this place was the dumplings, and I don't think I could even say they were bad.  They were just...dumplings.The chicken taco was good, but a little dry to me.  The Kalbi & spicy were phenomenal.  I'm a bit of a spice baby so I was worried, but they were perfectly spicy for my tastes.  I would go back and get a handful of those tacos for sure.The best part were the Kimchi fries.  I've recently discovered french fries covered in ""shit"".  Coopers does beef brisket french fries, Kuma's has the slayer, so I was expecting something along those lines.  But the difference here is all of the flavors complimented one another so perfectly, I didn't feel it overwhelmed the french fries.  They weren't super heavy either.  They were perfect.  Pork belly & kimchi on french fries is the way to go.Oh, and their soda selection is not as good as crisp.  If only every place had rubyred squirt...The worst part was the walk home where we passed Crisp.  I felt bad, but not bad enough because I'm thinking about going back tonight."
"This review only applies to the shrimp tacos... oh my God. If you go there and don't get them, you're doing yourself a disservice. For the price, they really can't be beat."
"Good banh mi's. Don't expect anything authentic here. It is a very pan-Asian restaurant. The most americanized taste I've gotten here is their kim-chi fries, which was all greasy and soggy. HOWEVER: their BBQ chicken Banh Mi's are heavenly. [May I ask, however, where is the cilantro? Why are there jalapenos? Is the baguette bread the only thing that makes this banh mi?] ehh, whatever. It's very tastily delicious. Between Del Seoul's and Ba Le's banh mi's, I would rather go to ba le's just because it's more healthy, more options, better prices, more authenticity. However, it's lincoln park... Just saying. Don't expect too much out of Asian food in this neighborhood.Haven't tasted their tacos yet, but i'll be back soon!"
"I have been wanting to visit Del Seoul for at least a year, and I finally made that happen!My wife and I ordered all 4 taco options (fish, shrimp, beef short rib, and pork) and split them in order taste each one.  Wow!  Each taco was simply delicious!   The flavors were perfect.  I will say that the prices are bit higher than I would like for what you get.   Overall, it was a great experience, and I will be back."
"Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Delicious ^^I told my friend from Korea that I was going to eat a Korean taco and he was like ""O_O!"" hahaha.The shrimp taco is the best and the kimchee pork fries are so good.The place is something similar to a cafe layout. Nothing fancy but not nasty like a fast food hotdog joint. I really enjoyed it. If you can mix my two favorite foods together (mexican and asian food) then you are a win.I will definitely go back again. the only downside for me........mmm, (thinking of a downside....................) that it's too far from me. lol ^^"
"Its very easy to walk past Del Seoul without even acknowledging it. If you do walk by, you are missing out on a very tasty and pretty cheap food.I've been here 3 times and their Korean Bahn Mi sandwiches are great. Very tasty, just the right amount of sauce and the bread is amazing. Pretty much as fresh as it gets. the only problem with the Bahn Mi sandwiches though is that you will eat them in seconds they are that good. If going for the Bahn Mi, try the Bulgogi or the Spicy BBQ Pork.The Korean BBQ Tacos are good too. I'm not a Taco fan but these are better than any crap from Taco Bell.The Kimchi and Pork Belly fries are really good. Not very traditional but again you will finish it in a few minutes and there is a great balance between Pork, Salsa and fries.I'm not a fan of their decor but they have great food and I will be back."
"I had high expectations of this place.  Everyone says the kalbi taco's are so good here...When my girlfriend and I got there, we told them it was our first time so the cashier lady started giving us recommendations.  What was funny though, was that she kept recommending everything on their menu..haha.  She just kept going down the list and waiting for a response from us, and if we didn't respond, she kept listing more.  I just thought that was funny.  Not something I count against them though.We ordered a kalbi taco and some kimchee fries.  The kalbi taco was pretty good.  I wished there was more kalbi in it, even though the kalbi wasn't up to my standards(I'm korean and know what good kalbi is).  I just would have appreciated more kalbi meat in the taco rather than the lettuce/cabbage that was spilling out the sides.  The kimchee fries were pretty good too.  Not what I was expecting, which is a good thing.  I never knew cheese and kimchee would work well together, but it kind of did.  The reason for the three stars is because the food was pretty good, but nothing spectacular.  I wouldn't drive 30 minutes from where I live just to get some kalbi tacos from here.  I am glad that there is a place like this though, since I think it's important to introduce yummy korean cuisine to the masses.  This fusion style cuisine seems to work well and I'm sure many people love the food here.  It's a good start, for sure..."
Shrimp tacos amazing. Everything else amazing. Amazing.
Taco's were good
"Korean BBQ tacos, dumplings, kamichi fries... just to name a few. My husband and I discovered this place just a few weeks ago and we've already become repeat customers. The food is hot, fresh, and tasty. It's very modern and clean inside, nothing fancy. You order your food at the counter and then they bring it to your table once it's ready. I would highly recommend this place as the line is often long and out the door which is a good sign. Great food for a reasonable price."
Yum...that pretty much sums it up! This place is awesome for lunch or dinner. You order the food at the counter and they will bring it to you. The fish tacos and fries that I last had where amazing and it's all quality food at a great price.
"This place is soooooooooooooooo great! When u see that there are many Korean eating inside, its because its great! The Shrimp tacos are spectacular, and  the meat one is Great too!!! the plates are great as well. I love love love itttttt would love it more if it would be BYOB..."
"mmm mmmm goood.Last night, Del Seoul held a soft opening. I believe I tried almost everything on the menu.First, dumplings. It almost reminded me of soup dumplings. Soft, warm and filled with meat inside, also very juicy! It came with a side of some sort of soy sauce. Adds a nice flavor to the dumpling.Next, all the tacos!Pork: love love love it!  This was the number one taco everyone loved at the soft opening, if I can speak for everyone. Shrimp: My fellow yelpers, I'm allergic to shrimp. Not deadly allergic, so I snuck in a bite. It looked too good for me to pass up. So glad I took that bite. It was delectable! Gosh, I miss eating shrimp. The shrimp had a tempura-like coating and made it all more flavorful! I believe all the tacos come with korean-seasoned lettuce and cabbage. Not exactly sure what else was in the tacos.Third, Ban Mi.Pork belly ban mi: It has the whole vietnamese concept of their sandwich but with a korean flare. The pork belly really adds a great flavor to the vietnamese sandwich. It sounds a bit confusing, as I was too, but I could honestly say, I could've ate another whole pork belly ban mi! *You must order this when Del Seoul opens to the public!*Also had the kalbi ban mi. Compared to pork ban mi, kalbi has less flavor but nonetheless, still good.I think I was getting very full at this point. It was not over yet.At last, the pork belly kimchi french fries! Ahhhhhh! This brought my whole appetite back! It is SCRUMPTIOUS!I never knew kimchi could go so well with french fries. I, thank you, Del Seoul for adding a new craving to my food list! haha. Fries are so crispy (just how I love my fries!), kimchi and pork belly is marinated perfectly to go along with fries, topped with sour cream, green onions and sesame seeds.I highly recommend pork belly tacos or ban mi with pork belly kimchi fries when Del Seoul opens to the public! Side note, not sure if this is a right place for vegetarians as most of the things on the menu seemed like there were meat and poultry in it. I don't think the restaurant was completely finished when I came in. The walls are painted in bright colors, menu is on plasma tvs high above the register. It's a decent size restaurant compared to the other restaurants in the area, like Aloha Grill and Molly's that almost everyone is aware of.  I think the prices go well with the portions.  I'm sure this place will be a huge hit once it's fully open!! I can't wait to go back!"
"I will eat just about anything out of a tortilla. Maybe it's my Mexican-cuisine bias, but whoever thought of slapping Korean in some tortillas is genius. These aren't your tex-mex tacos either, they're the real deal - the small tortillas stacked one on top of each other and oozing with goodness. Couldn't choose between the bulgogi taco or the spicy shrimp (which they suggested) so to make it easier I just went with both. Spicy shrimp had the perfect amount of zestiness and spiciness to it, and the bulgogi was tender and not chewy, like some can be. What complemented it all was the lettuce-slaw that they put ontop of it. It's marinated in some kind of sauce that is heaven on the tongue. All the spices marry together perfectly, and all wrapped up in a tortilla! Again, GENUIS."
god damn it these kimchi fries are out of this world.
"I was waiting for Del Seoul to open, but unfortunately when it did, I was in Taiwan.  I came back home to find out they opened AND they were #1 on hot on yelp... had to get there ASAP!I met a friend for lunch on a saturday.  It was busy, but not too crazy, and still a good place to meet up.  I ordered the kalbi and spicy pork tacos along with an order of dumplings for us to split.   My friend got two shrimp tacos.I was a little let down, they weren't as good as I thought they'd be.  The meats themselves (the ones I tried) were a little dry, and I didn't think seasoned as well as some kalbi and spicy pork I've had.  The spicy pork definitey should have been spicier!  ...maybe the Kalbi would have been better with more marinade?The dumplings were pretty good, but I tend to like them with a thinner skin.  The shape was interesting though, and they served them on a plastic pad, which made them easier to unstick (usually dumplings come on a bamboo steamer pot or a piece of paper that they get stuck to).I was very happy with the service and kind faces, PLUS cute kawi bawi bo (korean rock paper scissors) t-shirts!I will come back for sure and hopefully taste more things.  My friend said the shrimp tacos were delicious."
"After leaving Molly's Cupcakes feeling  less than welcomed....what a breath of fresh air Del Seoul was for me.  Delicious sesame crusted shrimp tacos.  Taco's were hot and came out fast.  These by far were the best shrimp tacos I've ever had.  I don't eat poultry, pork, or beef, and man I sure have been missing all three, but Del Seoul made be appreciate only eating things from the water.  Will be back...very soon."
"A nice attempt at Korean fusion, but there is room for improvement. Ordered all four tacos (kalbi, spicy bbq pork, spicy bbq chicken, sesame-chili shrimp). The first couple bites were good, but then everything began tasting the same. All the tacos are topped with the same cilantro-onion relish/chili-garlic salsa/""secret"" slaw. I really liked this refreshing, crunchy topping, but the seasonings in it like sesame oil, garlic, etc are quite strong so the predominant flavor I got was corn tortillas + slaw topping. The spicy bbq pork and spicy bbq chicken did not taste spicy to me. The kimchi pork belly fries ($6.95) were interesting. I didn't get much pork belly flavor, mostly fries + cheese + sour cream + hints of kimchi. Not worth the price in my opinion. The spicy bbq pork banh mi ($5.75) was good but would be better with more meat. Most bites were bread + pickled vegetables. Del Seoul's sandwich tasted like an imitation Vietnamese bbq pork banh mi so I'd rather pay $3.25 and grab a sandwich from Ban Le. If you're familiar with traditional Korean flavors (e.g. kimchi, gochujang, sesame oil, etc) and/or have eaten at restaurants such as San Soo Gab San or Cho Sun Ok, Del Seoul won't be a revelation for your taste buds. However, if you're new to Korean cuisine, you might love this place."
"I had a bulgogi banh mi the other day, which was pretty decent. Very great portion. However, Del Seoul didn't make me feel like: ""Man, I can't have enough of this, I am gonna go back here!"" The place is a little bit strange. They bring food to you, but once you are done, you clean up yourself. The Banh Mi I had was good but the drink there are not inexpensive at all ... Perhaps, Del Seoul is a place for all the quirks. Like combining Korean, Vietnamese, Mexican food in a very weird way... Overall, I think it is a decent place to hang out with friends. I rate it around 3.5 stars... I am just not a fan. The staff wasn't the most friendly folks. I like innovations in food, just not random mixtures to appeal to a larger crowd and lose your authentic touch."
These tacos rock!! Love this place!!1. Affordable.2. Delicious.3. Creative.4. A+++
"I went with my friends and we order each taco, the dumpling, the shrimp sandwich, and the Kimchi Fries. The shrimp is fried so shrimp anything here was my favorite. I really like the tacos the best and next would be the sandwiches.  They make a unique slaws for the taco that just goes with everything. My wishlist is if the tortilla was just a little more burnt. The Kimchi Fries was a nice touch but next time, I would take out the cheese( I know but lately I haven't been a fan of cheese)"
"I like a couple blocks away from here and have heard great things about it so it was time to check it out. I wanted to try the dumplings and some tacos but it was a 20 min. wait for the dumplings so I ordered 3 things of tacos instead. They probably ran out but I'd suggest just calling in your order before hand. It seemed like they were pretty fast with people just picking up. They say the tacos are just one per order but I think there's definitely enough for 2. They give you 2 tacos and fill the one with lots of meat and whatever else is in the order. I was full off 2 order of tacos, took a break, and later ate the third. The tacos were really tasty, delicious. I ordered the ribeye, chicken, and shrimp. Totally suggest them. My favorite was the ribeye, but you can't go wrong! I'll totally be back there to try more of their food!"
"I've been waiting for this place to open ever since I first saw a ""coming soon"" sign in the window months ago at 7 am after a morning boot camp session (of course, I was starving). I decided to drop by today before going to Cost Plus to make sure I wouldn't shop hungry. I wanted to order a lot of stuff but restrained myself to only ordering the kimchi and pork belly fries. OMG.. perfect. I'm not a fan of super sour or spicy kimchi, and so this was juuuuust right. It was flavorful, and I found myself picking up every little bit of the kimchi-onion-cheese-scallion topping that was left over.  Traditionalists may not be super satisfied--the concept is (of course) American-style fusion. My taste buds were happy and that's really all that matters to me (I'm not Korean though.. don't get me started about Vietnamese food). Will be back to try the other menu items. Recommend!"
"I'm impressed with this place.I asked the lady at the counter to surprise me with their 3 best tacos and needless to say, I was pretty happy.  Chicken can be avoided, but the others were great.  My girlfriend got the Dumplings which were amazing; especially considering I think most dumplings are hit or miss.  Also the Kimchi and Pork Belly fries were quite enjoyable, but easily enough for 2 or 3 people.Overall, worth a trip if you are looking for a snack or some ""street faire"".  I've still got more to try, so I'll keep you posted."
"Walking in there was a nice line forming so I am guessing this place has to be pretty decent if it's packed.  The menu is nicely lit in front of you on 3 big screen televisions. I ordered the kalbi taco, shrimp taco, pork belly fries and gamja fries.The shrimp taco was super delicious.  It was supposed to be spicy but it only had a little kick, thats why there is sriracha there! the flavoring of the shrimp was tasty and well cooked with a nice crunchy exterior.The pork belly fries were really tasty, it had pork belly, caramelized kimchi, onions, scallions, cheddar and jack, sour cream and of course french fries.  It tasted really good but for the price i dont think i would it again.  But i went here with friends and they offered me some i would not say no of course.The gamja fries were regular cut fries with a side of Garlic Sesame Aioli.  The sauce it came with was very tasty, the only downside is that it comes in a small cup and not even filled to the brim. With the amount of fries they give you they should at least give you 2 small cups of garlic sesame aioli. All in all i would rather have these fries than the pork belly fries just because the price is much more on the pork belly.My favorite dish here so far is the kalbi taco. its grilled short ribs with sweet soy and soju marinade.  They did not skimp out on the meat either. Big chunks of short ribs were present. The flavors were on point in this taco. Every taco here had cilantro onion relish, chili garlic salsa, a secret house slaw on 2 grilled white tortillas.Cash and credit accepted.Oh yeah and the music here was on point like pete marovich! Playing everything 90's hip hop and some nice west coast rap music too."
The shrimp tacos were ridiculously good. It's a chill place for Korean tacos.
"This place is the BOMB!!!! It was recommended to me by a close friend about a year ago and I never went because of my aversion to Korean food (haven't really given it a chance). I went to Del Seoul after a recent Cubs game and ordered their tacos which were amazing! The portions are decent especially the shrimp tacos. The flavor is on point. Meats are seasoned well and cooked just right. I haven't had the other items on the menu yet, but I surely will when I go back next time. If I really like a place, I'll always recommend it. I recently recommended Del Seoul to a colleague and she was raving the next day! Her entire party really enjoyed it!"
"I love this place. I wish it was closer to me.everything in this place is good, especially the shrimp. I dream about it. friendly and casual!"
"I wish you were close to work or to where I live. But noooo... you are dead center in between them. Thankfully my pal lives right near so there's always an excuse to go here. Not to mention Molly's, Lito's, Toro's, and Aloha Eats are all right there. Damn you Dave for living right next to these places! Damn you.I've had the tacos, the banh mi sandwiches, the kimchi fries, the dumplings, and the bibimbop. Not all in one sitting of course...but I have a good idea of my favorites there. I'd pass on the bibimbop and the dumplings, but definitely not the tacos, fries, or the banh mi. Personally, I like the shrimp taco and the bulgogi banh mi. Those fries are definitely a guilty pleasure. Them and Kuma's Corner are tops in my ""fries loaded with whatever on top"" category.In retrospect, maybe its a good thing I don't live in Lincoln Park...I'd probably end up morbidly obese."
I'm from LA and I still crave and long for the shrimp tacos here.  The kimchi fries were pretty good but the shrimp tacos are definitely a must!!!
"Yum.  A good twist on Korean.  Loved the fresh ingredients and copious amounts of sauce.  A little bit cramped in the seating, but we were able to find a table quickly.Try the tacos.  Definitely worth it!***UPDATE***Now that they have expanded...adding the 5th star.  The fish tacos were delicious and the ambiance is much nicer and much less cramped.  I really think the food got better since the beginning of the year too."
"I appreciate that they're trying something a little different, but I can't say I loved the food.We started off with an order of the kim chi fries.  They went pretty easy on the kim chi so they tasted like cheese fries with some hot sauce.  It was fun to eat them with chop sticks and they weren't bad cheese fries.  The bites that did have kim chi were pretty tasty, I think they're onto something interesting, but they're being timid with the funky fermented veggies (which I suppose is understandable, but doesn't win them points with me).Then we got an order of the dumplings.  They come out on a steam tray which is pretty cool, but the dumplings were pretty ordinary.  They tasted like frozen dumplings out of a bag (gummy wrappers, chunky ground pork and scallion filling), which I suspect they were.  Nothing wrong with that, frozen dumplings are a staple in my house, but not something I go out for.Then came the tacos.  I have to say the fried fish was very good.  I liked the light breading and the flaky fish.  The rest of the taco was overwhelming though.  They covered it in so much cabbage and sauce that I could barely taste the fish.  Worse was the tortilla that tasted like a typical supermarket tortilla.  In a town with so many great and cheap tortillas easily available, there's no excuse for the mealy, uncooked floury taste of that tortilla.  Similar feelings on the kalbi beef.  The beef was pretty good, though a little rubbery in parts, but the tortilla made for a pretty unpleasant aftertaste.We're glad we tried it.  We're fans of Crisp, so we were hoping for something along those lines.  Unfortunately we left disappointed."
"I want mexican!  I want korean food! I want taco bell!  I want a kalbi buffet!  Oh how will I choose???Oh right Del Seoul!  How you make this indecisive fool look like a assertive wise man!If you have the craving for korean and mexican then this is the place to go!  The beautiful collision of korean well marinated and tender meats and on two mexican soft tortillas.  I had had the kalbi taco, spicy pork, and shrimp taco with the gamja fries and kimchi fries!Kalbi taco - don't know if the kalbi was not tender enough because it cooled down but it was still deliciousspicy pork taco - amazing!  best taco, the pork was perfectly marinated and tender!  I would eat just this!shrimp taco - good, fried, and two pieces.  It was my least favorite.gamja fries - crispy fries with garlic onion mayo dip!  enough said, chew gum.Kimchi fries - I was excited for these because of the pork belly... but where is the pork belly??? where you is? Let me get my magnify glass.  other than that it was pretty interesting combo of kimchi, pork wherever it was, sourcream, onions, and cheese.Overall it was a great experience other than having to wait for a seat because seating is limited!  7 tables so big groups is difficult!  So what you waiting for get your mexican korean on!"
"I had two tacos as a light-ish meal while waiting for a haircut nextdoor. The Sesame-Chili Shrimp taco (marked on the menu as ""our BEST taco"") was pretty damned good. The Kalbi (grilled beef short rib) taco was AWESOME. They came in one basket and were filled so heavily that I ate with a fork.My food came out really quickly, though there weren't many people before me in line so I'm not sure that's constant. Still, yummy + cheap."
"With all this hype I've heard about Del Seoul and its comparison to LA korean fusion tacos, I had to stop by and try it out for myself. With a friend, we ordered both kalbi and spicy pork tacos, kimchee fries and a hot stone bibimbap. Tacos: one taco is actually equivalent to two LA food truck tacos so $2.50 is a great price. However, not a big fan of either (I liked the pork more than the kalbi) and I think LA wins this round but great to see Chicago having korean fusion tacos. Kimchee Fries: Delicious... such an unhealthy mix (cheese, kimchee, pork belly fat) but so darn good.... you will forget about your health as you kill all the fries. One order will definitely feed 2-3. Don't attempt to finish on your own... (although if i came back, i might just order the fries and eat it all myself....)Bibimbap: Eh... portion size is ok but nothing special and don't think I would order again. I def prefer Crisp's buddha's bowls over this...Overall, Del Seoul was a-ok.. slightly disappointed in the tacos (too much hype maybe) but the kimchee fries helps provide some redemption."
"Pros: Shrimp Tacos, Fries, Kimchi Fries. GOOD FUSION, and the best option around, (including that other fusion place off Belmont, La Taquoria?).Cons: Kinda pricey, can get crowded, portion sizes depend on the seasons. But honestly, Lincoln Park is a toilet for eating out unless you've got the money or the patience to deal with sub-par options. In other words, I'd go here if you want something decent in the area, but if you can get to Argyle or Morse, (See: Susie's Noon Hour Grill) that might be your better bet. Especially for authentic/ or not-fusion Korean. The biggest problem with this place is that the Management can be hit-or-miss, resulting in the staff being hit-or-miss. The comments I see about poor customer service would probably be fixed if management treated their staff better."
"I had heard about Del Seoul from a few friends before finally trying it yesterday.  I had literally stuffed myself one hour prior, but was walking around with a friend who wanted to pop in for a quick taco.  I sat there with food envy as I watched her devour the Kalbi taco (beef short ribs) covered in a fresh slaw.  As I looked around at the Bibimbop other diners were eating I suddenly found my food envy grow into thoughts of future hunger.  Trying to remain somewhat disciplined, I asked my friend if she'd be up to returning back in an hour or so once I had acquired an appetite.We came back.  It was literally all we could think about as we walked around Clark/Broadway/Belmont shopping.  I kept willing myself to get hungry and I didn't have to work too hard as i thought about the sights and smells of this tasty little place.When we did return we each ordered a Bibimbop, and I got a ""Big Jar O Kimchi"".  We also ordered a side of the Seasoned Gamja Fries.  yeah, I still wasn't all that hungry, but I couldn't help myself!Everything was SO FRIGGIN GOOD.  We're already making plans for when we can return to try, um, everything else on the menu...The Bibimbop was super fresh (much better ingredients than what is offered at Crisp up the street on Broadway) and an incredibly generous portion.  The Kimchi was awesome, and I had some left over to bring home to pop in the fridge.  For $3 you get a huge jar of it!  And the fries?  Wow."
"Is it just me who had such high expectations for this place and was utterly disappointed????  They have been on ""opening soon"" list for so long and I was actually bit excited to have Korean owners open korean fusion restaurant. (No, Joy Yee's. You are not Korean...so you should not make Korean food-_-).  But, maybe I expected too much too soon.  Having had Korean-style tacos in Cali, I was hoping for more juicy meats and fresh vegetable like in the past.  However, the meats were bit dry (like they have been cooked for too long), and the spices were too much for me to handle.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm Korean girl to the bone, meaning I can handle spiciest Korean peppers (chung yang go chu) like no one can.  But it wasn't just spicy.  It was salty, spicy, and really heavy all at the same time.  Kalbi taco was actually better than the spicy pork, which was definitely one of the saltiest things I've ever put in my mouth.And I was sick with a stomachache all night that night....along with my fiancee.  We both could not sleep a wink, and had to open new rolls of toilet papers because of it. (sorry for those thinking about eating).I think this place was too hyped before opening...and they got really really eager to live up to its hyped advertisements.  Del Seoul, I would try you guys again, but tone down the MSG in your sauces, and we'll definitely get along!"
Can't say enough good things about this place!  The BBQ shrimp tacos are my favorite.  Cheap and beyond delicious. Their ganja (sp?) fries are excellent t. Most people go with the poutine fries but these are so flavorful with the seasoning & garlic aioli. You can't best the prices and the food comes out quick.
"Four star food for under $10? If you're in Lincoln Park I don't see why you'd go anywhere else. Modern Korean done right, made fast, and served with a smile. I've never been to South Korea but in my adventures across the states I make it a point to hit at least one place that serves kimchi in every city. I'd have to say Del Seoul is in my top five, beating out venues that cost twice as much. First time visitors have to try the tacos, especially the shrimp. If sea food isn't your thing, the kalbi taco is amazing as well. In fact any of their ribeye or short rib dishes come out so tender and juicy, you might be confused upon leaving to see the streets of Chicago instead some southern BBQ joint.Decor and service are on par as well. Possibly excellent if you consider the interior of the other eateries surrounding it."
"Where is my vegetarian taco option?? Some vegetable rice bowl that I tried once and would never again pay more than $3 for. Not veggie-friendly. In this city?I went when they first opened and got carryout. I was nice enough to bring fries with some sort of pork for my husband. He didn't love them. My vegetables were grainy and unappetizing. So we let them get their act together and waited a few months, and tried again. I still didn't like the vegetables and he didn't care too much for his dumplings.But the place is always full!! So there must be something good about it. If you're not vegetarian or my husband, apparently."
"I've been meaning to come to this place for a while.  Part of me was intrigued by Korean tacos, and part of me was a little weirded out....maybe that's why it took me so long.Anyway, a friend and I stopped in and we decided to go all out.  We shared the kalbi plate, the spicy chicken banh mi, and I had a shrimp taco and she had a pork taco.  All of it was DELICIOUS.  Growing up on Korean food, I am familiar with the tastes, so it was nice to have it with a little twist.  When I go back, I think I may just stick to the sammie and the tacos...I mean, you can't really beat my Parents' kalbi and kimchee. LOL."
"I honestly didn't know about this place until my friend told me about it the first day it opened. Theres so much hype about this place, so my friends and i finally decided to check this place out. The line wasn't too long, but all the seats were full and our food was actually ready in less than 5 minutes so waited until a table opened up.I got the pork bahn mi sandwich, the korean bbq tacos, and the kalbi taco, and as well as the gamja fries with garlic aioli. i was also able to try to pork belly fries with kimchi. overall, Im not a big fan of their tacos, but their sandwiches and fries were soo good, espically with the jalapenos. I wanted to buy another one before I left but i didnt want the bread to be soggy so i just thought i should fill the rest of my apetite with a molly's cupcake. =Pthis place reminded me of the kogi trucks in cali, and although i wasnt too fond of their tacos, i still have to try their shrimp tacos, which im hoping will be tasty! and i was hooooping this restaurant was byob, but nope."
"I went on opening day with my brother who pretty much eats Korean food every other day like it's his job. We were both uber-impressed with the food! We ordered one of each taco, the kimchi-pork belly fries, and the dumplings. (Gluttonous, I know.)Now I'm a carnivore for sure and normally could care less about the greens in my tacos, but the toppings for each were great!  I could eat their greens alone and enjoy them.  The sesame seeds too added a great texture to the taco, and the light acidity was gave a good balance with the meat.  However after eating four of these babies, you'll start to realize that there not much of a flavor difference between the tacos since the seasonings and the greens are pretty much the same.  That being said, there's no need to try to devour all four in one sitting - next time, I'd go for the kalbi (a classic) and either the shrimp or pork.What I wasn't expecting, though, were how amazing the dumplings were!  I just came back from a soup dumpling binge in Shanghai a bit before my visit to Del Seoul, so I've become pickier with my dumplings in general.  You cannot get better dumplings than these in the north side.  They're homemade and so juicy...it really did remind me of soup dumplings despite the fact that it didn't have any broth.  Definitely a hidden gem for a place where the taco gets the spotlight."
"Finally- I got to try a kalbi taco... and to my surprise... not as good as the others you can choose from.  Not saying that the kalbi taco is bad cause it is delicious.  The meats has been well marinated and I would even gorge it down by it's lone self.  It's just that the other tacos I ate were even better.  The bbq pork taco was awesome.  The flavor of the pork and the greens mixed with a soy dressing really worked as each of their distinct flavors come out better than in the kalbi taco.  But the best one was the shrimp taco.  The shrimp is panko breaded and fried and has a sauce on it that has a hint of spice.  Put that in a taco with the same greens with a soy sauce dressing and you have an winner.What took me back more was... fries with kimchee and pork belly on top?  I love fries... I love pork belly... I love kimchee (cabbage and fresh... not having gone through the fermenting process... sorry I'm just not Korean like that)... but all of them together?  The truth is... it's delicious.  Over a bed of fries like grilled kimchee mixed with pieces of pork belly.  Then it is covered with cheese, a drizzle of sour cream, and topped with diced scallions.  The fries by their lone self, I have had better... but altogether?  Very impressive.  I usually hate sour cream but in this dish.... definitely didn't mind.To those in the nearby area looking for their fresh kimchee fix... they sell it by the jars for three bucks.  They also sell korean chip/snack products as well as a few korean drinks.  I have to warn you though that this place has only 10 tables that could fit a total of 35 people.   So try to get a spot to sit quick and enjoy."
"I wish I had enough money or investors to start a korean taco place first. There was no doubt that this place was going to be popular - this korean taco trend has been going on for too long in other cities. That said, I've never tried them before, so I was (probably like many others) very excited to try this place. First off, it's so much better than senoya. Thank goodness. So, the place is pretty small with not a lot of seating. When I went, there was no line, but there was also minimal seating. Kind of frustrating too that they hoard the water behind the counter and give tiny little cups.I ordered the shrimp taco and shrimp banh mi - both of which were highly recommended by blogs. Both lived up to the hype. My friend ordered the kalbi, pork, and chicken and said the kalbi was the best. So basically, everything is pretty good. I want to go back and have my fob mom try it."
"mmMmm! I've been anticipating the opening of this restaurant for a couple months now. It was definitely worth the wait! The owners are relatives (I believe the children) of the owners of Senoya: an Asian buffet in Niles. So I was glad to see that the next generation are fusing their Korean heritage with the modern interest of today's taste buds.I've heard good things about the Korean tacos out in California, so I was hoping this place would be my local fix for that genre of food.First let me say they were out of Bibimbop (what I was really craving), and there was no where to sit, w/ a line out the door just to order. With that being said, it was maybe the 4th day of opening their doors to the public and it was a Friday evening: so, I guess I can understand the crowdedness.I settled with ordering the sesame-chili shrimp and the seasoned gamja fries. I was not disappointed with my choice. The fries were delicious & the Aioli that was served with it was mouth-watering good! I ended up putting some Aioli on my tacos too =]Although I don't think the tacos needed any extra ingredients, the Aioli and some sriracha were like icing on the cake for my shrimp tacos. The shrimp was crispy, and the sesame-chili wasn't too spicyI recently read on their facebook that they switched tortilla vendors: so I guess I have to go back and try out their ""new"" tacos. That, and I still want to satisfy my Bibimbob craving."
Long drive for an ok chicken taco. The gal bi taco was killer. Dumplings and fries were ok. Just get the gal bi tacos don't waste valuable stomach space.
"Bahn mi in mah tummi.  SO good.  Shrimp and bbq pork are my favorite.  The dumplings are also really great,The french fries are not happening though.  Always soggy.  Turn the temp up on the oil PLEASE- potatoes are not supposed to ever be that soggy.  Avoid those, stick to the dumplings, and you will be happy."
"Overall this place is kind of a disappointment. I wanted to love it because the concept is so wonderful---but in reality most of the food is mediocre. I have tried most of the tacos and the kimchi french fries. The flavor's were okay on the tacos but not nearly as delicious as I thought they'd be from reading the menu...ehh, it's pms food at best."
"I hit Del Seoul last night for some post-workout grub. I knew it had just opened and most of the reviews were positive. The feeling I got walking in the door is that this place is fresh, clean, and will probably be around a while. It reminds me of how they decorate chipotle but with an Asian style instead of Mexican. When I walked up to the counter and didn't know what I wanted, the girl working the register was patient and helped me decide how many tacos to order. ""I can eat 2 and you're much bigger than me... get 3"", she said. I took that advice to heart and got the Chicken, Pork, and Short Rib tacos. I got them to go, but I wish I hadn't. When I got home (roughly a block away) my tacos were lukewarm, and the tortillas were starting to stiffen up. Now, that being said, if these tacos were hot like I expected, I think I'd give this place 4 stars instead of 3. The seasoning was good, the meat was tender, and everything was in place for me to have a damn good taco. Oh well, I'll definitely be trying this place again though. Their dumplings and rice bowls looked really good.Takeaways:  $8.50 on 3 tacos  ""Spicy"" bbq pork is not spicy  Don't get takeout, it will probably be cold when you get home  Try the veal?"
"Great for a quick bite if you are in the Lincoln Park area.  Noteworthy:  Shrimp tacos, seafood soup, kimchi fries, but you really can't go wrong with any of the picks."
"Had their Kalbi tacos, kalbi vietnamese sandwich, kimchi fries. All really good. I don't like to eat kimchi, but those kimchi fries won me over!Place is small, some street parking. It's a very laid back kind of place. Place is clean and well lit.  Reasonable prices. Would recommend & go back again!"
"Amazing. Spicy if you need it that way and if you don't, they still have you covered. The wings are to die for. As are the dumplings, tacos and big bowl. Wow."
"I stopped by here for a snack a few weeks ago because I'd been dying to try it since it opened. I had the shrimp tacos, and they were excellent,,,just the right amount of spice.I have heard from other friends that other menu items were great as well.Can't wait to try the pork belly kim chi fries.Thumbs up!"
"How do I feel about Koreans? What about Mexicans?But wait, tacos. And don't forget kimchi.Mash all 4 together, now how do I feel?Feel like I slept with a girl, it was good, but she told me very little about herself.That's how I feel about Del Seoul.Not bad, not great. But a solid ""good"". I went with the fish taco, bbq pork, and the shrimp taco. Also enjoyed the steamed street style dumplings as well. The dumplings were easily the most average dish I enjoyed there and the shrimp taco was simply the best. The shrimp taco was a little spicy, filling, and very tasteful. The bbq pork taco tasted very similar to that of a pastor taco you'd get from any Mexican joint, except it had cabbage on it. The fish taco very large and hard to handle, but delicious as well.I do not like the spicy sauce/orange mayo they drizzle on everything. I guess this was their special kimchee sauce. I was not a fan of that at all. They also load your tacos with tons of cabbage that you'll find falling off when trying to eat. Nothing mind blowing, just an extra average place."
"Go! Now! Don't wait!This little Lincoln Park Korean Taco house lives up to the hype surrounding it. I got the Kalbi, Spicy Pork, and Spicy Shrimp Tacos. And while they were all good the Spicy Shrimp excelled above the rest!I will be back very soon for the Spicy Shrimp Bahn Mi!!!Update 10/24 - Sesame-Chile Shrimp Bahn Mi was delicious!! The bread was crusty on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside just like a a bahn mi should.  The shrimp was tasty with a good hint of spicy. the vegetables were fresh and plentiful. I will be back again very soon for... well I don't know what I want yet!!Update 10/30 - yes I know this is getting a little ridiculous but this place is just that good. I finally had the kimchi and pork belly fries. They were delicious. I had never had kimchi before but I found it balanced well with the dish without being too sour of overpowering in the dish. I will be back soon. That is a promise."
"This place had to have advertised they were ""opening soon"" longer than any place I remember! After they were featured in the red-eye I became even more excited to try this place... however it was a few days after their featured article that they actually opened. The service was friendly, but it seemed like I waited for my food for quite a while. I ordered some Kalbi tacos to go and I would describe them as ""pretty good"". I had a pretty bad stomach ache that night after eating them though. A week later I decided to give it another shot and wrote the stomach ache off as unrelated. I tried a Bolgogi Sandwich, which I was completely unimpressed with. It had very little meat on it and had TONS of daikon and cilantro on it that it may have well just been an overly toasted bun with daikon and cilantro with a hint of meat. I ate 1/4 of this and went somewhere else to get something to eat. What a waste of money.  I should also mention I got sick that day as well.... I sense a pattern."
"Here's my story:Got there at 8, out of Del Seoul by 8:30. Why so fast you ask? Because the food is so freakin' DELICIOUS we annihilated the Kalbi tacos and fries with aioli sauce!!If you came upon this page for Del Seoul, then you MUST come here and try it."
I went here on a saturday because my brother found this place on the interweb. I live in the suburbs so it was quite a drive.. was it worth it? ehh...I had the kalbi and sweet chicken tacos. They were okay...nothing to die for..and its kind of pricey. 3 stars..its okay. Not worth the drive i guess lolz.
Their bulgogi is the best thing on the menu - you can't go wrong with ordering anything with this delicious marinated meat in it. It's a fairly small place so expect to wait if you get here at peak hour. The good thing is that they seem to turn tables around pretty quickly. The dumplings are also quite good; you can tell that they are homemade and not the frozen stuff restaurants buy in bulk. I would recommend eating the tacos on-site as they might get soggy on the way home. PS - The banh mi with bulgogi is delicious and can beat any banh mi specialty place in the city!
"Kalbi tacos!!!Those of you who are looking for tacos to taste like any other tacos, don't go here. go to La Pasadita.Those of you who are looking to get a taste of Korean BBQ, go to a Korean BBQ like Haewoondae, Chicago Kalbi and Chosunok!Now, if you're looking to try something new with a little bit of the old taste? Then go here!!!-I liked their tacos, tried the kalbi, spicy chicken and the spicy pork. The spicy pork is not that spicy but you get the idea. -The Bahn mis-- the meat marinade is good but I think the Vietnamese sandwich shop on Argyle is better. It's got more flavorful pickled radish and carrots. -The kimchee porkbelly fries were good but it is more pricey (~$7)... for their portion***TRY their Korean snacks and drinks! It's tasty and you get a new cultural experience with chips! Ask for ""Baccus"" it's a small energy drink that taste like Red Bull but better!The complaints about the prices: Ok if you want to get cheap tacos, go to a Taqueria! Korean BBQs come to about $30-50 a person, depending on where you go so please don't compare Korean tacos to the original ones. Kimchees are another one of those things that are expensive. I buy two head of cabbage for $9 bucks. That is not a lot of kimchee if you consider most Korean families go through about 30-100 heads of napa cabbages a year. Shopping at a Korean grocery mart is so much more expensive than shopping at a local fruit market. I just wanted to show some price comparison so people can understand that the tacos at Del Seoul were not expensive at all!"
"The interior sucks.  I mean, seriously, it suuuuuucks.  And this certainly isn't the first place to do korean tacos, so if you care about that then... uh... too bad. So thats the bad stuff, got it all?  Good.  Lets talk about how Del Seoul is heaven on a plate.  I tried one of each type of taco and they were all delicious (shrimp was my favorite).  The meat was wonderful, beautifully complex flavor and wonderful texture.  Then the toppings were fresh, went with the meat perfectly, and were delicious even on their own.   I'm already in love, how did this perfect little slice of LA sneak into chicago and for only $2.50 a piece? To wrap it up the music was great and the food came super fast.  If this place was a little dirtier (it was so bright and clean and boring, I hated that) it would be heaven... because apparently heaven involves cheap korean tacos in a slightly dirty establishment with good music... just go with it alright"
"This would have garnered a 4.5 star review from me at first but I did have some indigestion issues afterward.  We tried their kalbi taco, pork taco, chicken taco and fries.  The best was probably the chicken taco for me but my husband enjoyed their kalbi taco more.  Washed it all down with cups of their tea - the Korean green tea was nothing special but the ginger tea was more helpful in the digestion process.  Service was good and prices are decent.This place definitely fills up with seating for about 20 people max and is in a decent space, as well.  I'm hoping that my issue was just a one time thing and probably will be back to give Del Seoul another try!"
"Stopped into Del Seoul for the first time after watching a show on the Travel Channel about the street food in Seoul and hearing good things from neighbors. Well, thank goodness for that travel channel show, because this restaurant is amazing!I think by now I've gotten pretty close to tasting everything on the menu, and I have yet to find something that isn't amazing. The bibimbop is amazing, and even more so in a hot stone bowl. You can't go wrong with the dumplings, and the kim chi pork belly fries are enough to make you trek through any sort of weather to get a delicious handful. If you haven't been here yet, please go- but make sure you leave me a table!"
"I've been waiting for years for a Korean BBQ place to hit Chicago and was so excited to hear that Del Seoul was opening.  I've been a big fan of Korean bbq when I first discovered it in California and knew it was a matter of time before it caught on.The Kalbi tacos were very good but truly enjoyed the bbq pork tacos.  They were very flavorful and not as salty.  The tacos are cheap and so filling!  This is a great bargain and a bang for your buck!The Kimchi fries are a must try as well as the pork baguette sandwich.  There's really a great selection of Korean ""street"" food so enjoy!  I can't wait to go back for my fix.  I predict that Korean tacos will be the next trend to take over this pork/bacon craze that's been overdone to death."
"I got the galbi taco, spicy bbq pork, and sesame-chili shrimp.  The tacos are small, so you're not going to get full off of one.  They don't use the traditional lettuce & ingredients that you put in normal tacos.  They use a Korean-style slaw (slightly spicy marinated/ sesame oil (?)/soy sauce ) and other ingredients that go well with the tacos.  The sesame-chili shrimp was the most flavorful and is definitely my favorite.  I recommend the Kimchi & Pork Belly Fries. The meat was cut into really small pieces, and I kind of wished the meat was a little bigger/chunkier.  Before eating this, I thought that the Sour Cream would be a little weird with the Kimchi, but I was wrong... it actually gave a good kick to it.Overall, this place is awesome...one of my new favorites in chi town."
Reminds me of west coast food trucks but maybe better
"It doesn't get any better than the sesame-chili shrimp tacos.  The slaw that is on the taco is perfectly seasoned and is just a burst of flavor in your mouth.  The kalbi taco is good too, but I prefer the shrimp.  I've also tried the kimchi & pork belly fries, which are good but are a meal on its own.  Don't do what I did and over order, unless you really want to."
"This place is goooooood. Love the secret slaw (although I've had almost identical to it before at Kbbq places in Cali) with their creative relish and definitely heart the meat. BUT, I'd skip out on the dumplings. I am a dumpling queen (no, seriously!) and have had similar ones from the frozen section at Hmart. (Sorry 100 year old streets of Seoul recipe!). And honestly, I don't think the prices are too bad either. There's a lot of work that goes into these tacos!"
"Whoever thought a fusion between Mexican and Korean would work?  But it does!  Just thinking about how Del Seoul paired up the two makes my mouth water.  I had the Kalbi, Spicy Pork & Shrimp tacos and the combination of Korean marinated meat on a tortilla with shredded lettuce with some concoction made up of sesame seed oil and other delicious juices, it was so delicious, juicy and done well.  We added some of the chilli sauce from the bottle and it was outstandingly flavorful. We will be going back again..."
"It took me a while to try Del Seoul.  I had heard the place was either amazing or overrated.  In my opinion, as you can see from the 5 stars above, I thought the food was amazing.  We ordered: 1. Kimchi fries - I loved them, but I agree with the other reviewers, there needs to be more pork belly.  2. Fish Taco - Really good, but not as good as the kalbi, or pork tacos. 3. Sesame Chili Shrimp - Spicy and delish. 4. Kalbi - ORDER IT. Kalbi makes anything taste good.  Extremely flavorful, juicy, and delicious. 5. Spicy BBQ Pork - ORDER IT. Spicy but not too spicy. Really good, highly recommend. The table next to us ordered BBQ plates and their food smelled and looked so mouthwatering that I had to restrain myself from reaching over their table to grab a forkful of their dish.  Fresh ingredients, flavorful meats, and a memorable meal.  Definitely try it out."
"More of a miss than a hit.  I ordered the dumplings and bibambop, both of which had problems.  The dumplings weren't very savory and the very thick dough tasted store-bought not fresh-made.  As to the bibambop, the meat was overcooked and the rest of it did not excite the senses.Maybe this place is good for fusion food, but for traditional Korean food I wouldn't recommend it."
"Well, yeah, OK, turns out Del Seoul really is quite excellent. Three tacos and you're good (chicken is the least interesting of the four available when I went), but get the kimchi fries if you're feeling gluttonous. And the dumplings. Just very excellent Korean-Mexican street-style food. All very fresh and satisfying. Can't go wrong IMO.Servers were very friendly and accommodating for me and my infant daughter. Will go back as frequently as possible. Wish I lived closer."
"1pm Take awayStreet parking (busy area)Small place, fast food type of feelFriendly and fast serviceEating  food with my fingers.( Try running that by my mom) Ordered the Kalbi taco, Chicken Taco, Seasoned fries (really wanted the kimchi & prok belly fries)Enjoyed the kalbi taco, would pass on the chicken taco. The chicken meat was tight. It was just blah to me."
They said the shrimp taco would be the best ummmm ok not!!! It only had about 2 shrimps and I believe I tasted that same taste before from another restaurant. The shrimp they have as an appetizer at bonefish grill is called a bang bang shrimp and they give you so much shrimp and pay as much as you did for the shrimp tacos from this place. This place was ok the BBQ plate could have had more sauce too but I guess they were saving sauce too geez ... Who knows maybe they can add more shrimp and add some more BBQ sauce I may come back ....
"My favorite restaurant in the area! The fusion of flavors is delicious. My husband and I usually get the gamja fries to share. The seasoning is bold and the garlic aioli is amazing. Definitely ask for extra aioli. I LOVE the shrimp tacos - garlicky and and rich, sweet shrimp and fresh crunchy topping in corn tortillas. Not a fancy place, but food is great. They need to open a downtown location!"
"We went last tonight, a Wednesday, around 8, and I was pleasantly surprised that there were a few open tables. I jumped on the table while my wife got in line.She returned with pork belly fries and a selection of tacos: kalbi, shrimp and bbq pork. All three were mighty impressive, and the fries...I almost ate the waxed paper! My favorite is probably the shrimp (I'm a huge fan of fish tacos) but all of them were delicious. The sesame seeds and citrus tang complemented the spicy slaw. The kalbi was the sweetest but I would go back in a heartbeat and try all three again."
"People really hyped this place up, but it is really good. I love the shrimp tacos, cause they are fried perfectly. The reason why there are 4 stars is because the price is a little too much."
"Each time I come to Chi-Town, I have to try something new. My last visit brought me here, and it sure did not disappoint. Let me just say this--I was here 2 months ago and I am still dreaming about their delicious Kabi Poutine. Hands down one of the best dishes I have had. Trust me, it's totally worth the calories. The pickled red onions had the perfect amount of sweetness without losing their tanginess, and the ribs were done perfectly. My cousin had the street dumplings, another epic food win. I will definitely return here on my next visit!"
"I don't get what the big deal is. I'm guessing many people have never even heard of kimchi fries or kalbi tacos before this place, which in that case, GO TO CALI. I'm also guessing that many people have never even tried REAL kimchi or kalbi, which in that case, GO TO A KOREAN RESTAURANT. This place is over priced for something that isn't even clever to begin with. Please don't praise this place until you've tried the real shit. I give it two stars because Del Seoul is smart for setting up shop next to Molly's (yum), and also because the food isn't THAT BAD, it's just not THAT GOOD."
"Let me start off by saying that I have never had Korean BBQ before so I didn't really know what to expect. On the other hand, I could eat mexican tacos everyday and wouldn't mind actually trying to. At times I believe that I have a taco shaped mouth because it seems that is the only food that fits in it. I ordered 3 tacos, one pork, one chicken, and one beef rib. The price is not too much higher than Mexican tacos ($2.50 vs $~1.90). The food came out quick enough and was at good temperature. All 3 tacos looked the same so I made sure to clarify which was which. I made sure I used sriracha sauce and happily consumed all three. The pork was the best, it was a nice blend of spice and sweet. The the chicken was my second favourite and was very similar in taste to the pork taco except the chicken was less salty. The beef rib taco was a less than outstanding combination of flavours compared to the two other tacos. The tortillas are great and authentic mexican corn tortillas. I will be working this place into my evening menu frequently. They just need to come up with a Korean equivalent of horchata and I will move in!!"
"This place is just an OK place. Nothing special aside from being something different from the norm. Things I ordered: kimchi fries, shrimp taco, pork taco and dumplings, bulgogi banh mi and bibimbop.The kimchi fries were surprisingly good. If you like spicy and tangy then this is for you. The dumplings were good too. They came out piping hot. You gotta eat them fast because one its gets cold it'll start to harden a little. Still edible but not as good as when they are still soft and warm. I didn't fancy the tacos very much. I'm not a fan of sweet meat, which the pork taco fell into that category. The shrimp taco was ok but on the small size in my opinion. If you like a lot of vegetables with your taco...you'll like their tacos. Its loaded with their ""secret slaw"". My wife ordered teh bulgogi banh mi. She liked it and said it was good. I thought it was pretty good too.The bibimbop was pretty good too. I always order this at any korean restaurant in case i don't like something i ordered previously. You can't go really mess up this dish much. It's a bed of vegetables, meat and and egg over a bowl of rice!Again, this place is a nice place to get a quick bite. The staff is friendly and nice. Food is fresh and quick so that is a plus. They're located in Lincoln park so parking will be kind of a hassle during peak time. Seating is small so if you want a seat you might get lucky during rush hour otherwise just order it to go. Cool place to people watch too but don't hog the tables when there are 30 people in the restaurant!"
"Best Korean joint in the entire city.  Kimchi fries are great but what really makes me go back are the amazing tacos (what?! Korean tacos? Yes please.) and the potstickers.  They are so good, that everytime I think of them, my mouth literally waters and it is all I can think about.  Also, I love how fast they cook, how chill the environment is, and how much delicious food you get for $20."
amazing food! love the taco and kimchi fries and k-town chicken yum!
Stopped by here when it had just opened and had a Kalbi taco.  I had my baby in a carrier so eating the taco was a bit tough with hands and the staff was kind enough to get me a fork and napkin.The taco was very flavorful and yummy plus you can't beat the price.  I highly recommend and can't wait to go there again and try some of the other dishes!
"Korean fusion... I had to try it. What's better than asian food fused with almost anything?! I've been very satisfied with several asian fusion places around in the area, and while Del Seoul is tasty, it didn't blow me away like other places have. I'd really say it's 3.5 stars. Tacos run about $3 each. I tried the shrimp taco and the bbq chicken taco. The shrimp taco was pretty good; the chicken taco was just okay. They both needed a little sriracha to add some flavor and spice. The best part of my meal was the gamja fries with the garlic aioli. I wanted to order the dumplings too, but they only had pork-filled ones, and I don't eat da' pig. Sad... sigh. Despite my sighs, I will likely give this place another try if I'm in the neighborhood. I should at least try the bibimbop before totally writing this place off."
"I love korean barbeque and this is a cute, fast place that also has korean tacos. I had the bulgogi platter that had a huge portion of beef, with bok choy, rice, and kim chee. It was sooo good and very inexpensive! Great, quick place to eat! My friend had the seafood hot pot with tofu and the bite I had was great! Would definitely get that another time!"
"Del Seoul is clean, fast and friendly. My husband and I have tried this place twice.  The Sesame-Chili Shrimp Tacos and the Kimchi Fries are outstanding!  We also very much enjoyed the Ribeye Steak Banh Mi; however, we were a little disappointed with the Kalbi BBQ plate and the dumplings.  I guess we are a little spoiled by our friend's Korean home-cooking."
I love this place.The shrimp tacos is SOOOO GOOOD!!!!and the Kimchi fries just hits the spot!!
"To quote the pickiest eater I know who does not like tacos, ""this is the best taco I've ever had.""  Now THAT means something if it can make this man a believer!  Luckily, I agree, best taco I ever had!  Tastiness in this order: kalbi,  pork, shrimp, chicken.  I had to overextend my mouth to take a bite out of it since it was piled mile high with the veggies.  I didn't do my yelp homework before going and fell for the TRAP of the KIMCHI FRIES.  Definitely not worth it!  Don't fall for the novel title and end up paying 7 bucks for fries lacking in kim chi and smothered in cheese.  Save the money for the tacos!"
"Creative Korean meals! On Saturday, this small but cute restaurant always has a long line crossing the dining area. When you enter, if the first thing you are looking for is to grab a seat, you better not to do it and let your worries go. Because their staff make sure you will have a seat if you dine in. I made the mistake when I entered because subconsciously, I want to make sure I get a spot for my lunch and ignore what they said on the white board. It's a fast-food type restaurant but very creative. They mix Korean and Mexican food's idea which becomes a symbol for this restaurant. Price: everything is less than $10 and it fills your stomach. Food: I like the creation and their BBQ meat is very tasty and juicy. Service: It's better than Mcdonald's ."
"I LOVE this place. Best Korean BBQ in Chicago, and SO cheap. There's never a wait and you are in and out in 20 minutes if you just want a quick bite to eat.Get the shrimp tacos, the best ones I've ever had. And if you want something more traditionally Korean, try the Bim Bim Bop. I crave them both far too often; thank goodness it's ridiculously affordable."
"I think it is alright. I know my friends LOVE this place. I feel like it is over priced. The food is good, but I think it can be better. It is something I do not mind trying once or twice or a once in awhile place. It is not a place where I am crazy about. It has definitely expanded since 2010 where the place was half its current size."
"Great restaurant, i love korean food, but don't always have the time to go to the  restaurant far from my home and to grill it etc....This is a great alternative, food is delicious; love the tacos which are unique and the kalbi plate.... etc...... and the price is right."
"Never tried this west coast food truck inspired fusion of latin american and korean cuisine before.  saw great pictures, looked forward to going a lot, walked away satisfied but not dazzled.  STILL, I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND TRYING THIS PLACE AT LEAST ONCE, despite the 3 star rating.  it's more like a 3.5 star.Favorite one was the SHRIMP TACO.  The kimchi fries were tasty and i loved the idea and the flavor but, like it's nacho counter part, it's only good for like the first 2 minutes and after that it's just soggy and flavorless after you get past the toppings.  basically, the melted cheese goes cold and seals the kimchee and other toppings from combining with the fries underneath, so only the top layer of fries gets the cheese/kimchee and the lower layer stays plain.  and the top layer isn't that great since the cheese hardens into a rubbery blanket.  i suggest going with the less natural but more mixable cheese whiz.  or if you want to go high end, figure out a way to place a high quality liquid cheese on top that won't harden.  it's key!haven't tried the mandu - but it looked good - but not very special to me.  I agree with David C. that it's the slaw not the meat that makes the taco special."
"My buddy and I tried out this place.  I have been wanting to go there since they opened.  We ordered Fish Tacos, Kalbi Tacos, a Kalbi Bowl and Kimchi Pork Belly French Fries.  The Kalbi taco and Kalbi bowl was very good.  Fish taco was alright.  The Kimchi Pork Belly French Fries were OK.  Enough for 2-3 and had to have them at least once.  Probably will not get them again.The place had a casual atmosphere in a young fun neighborhood. Overall I enjoyed my experienced and very much liked the Kalbi. Will be going back..."
"Rock and Roll!  All I can say is if you are in the area, this place is a must.  Kick A$$ taco's, beepmbop; great food with a Korean twist.  That's the thing, you get your kimchee and insanely great marinated ribeye and short ribs done up in a taco or on a sandwich and you're like, bam, tough actin tenactin.  This is crazy good lunch for under $10.  A few observations.  Service is quick.  I always get takeout. The space is not good for groups of +4 and at lunch it's always busy, so you'll have to wait on a table."
"Little storefront with seating for about 20 with counter service and carry out, which is what I did. More on that in a second... The food itself is really good, with Korean BBQ and crunchy veggies filling tacos as well as Korean-style bahn mi. I would definitely go back...the only reason I can't give the 4th star that this place deserves is that either the food just doesn't travel well, or they need to pack up to-go orders a little better. I got 4 tacos to go, and by the time I got home 15 minutes later, the meal had gone south. The tacos were dry, the filling was cold. I don't really want to judge them based on this experience, so I will be back soon, eat in, and update my review. Beyond the crummy carry out experience, everything looks great, smells great, and this place is usually pretty packed, so that's evidence of something being done pretty well. Next time, Del Seoul, next time."
"This place is great.  The food tastes great, and it won't break the bank.  I have tried most of the menu and everything I have had so far was good.  I would try the bulgogi banh mi."
Awesome fusion!
"Everything we tried was amazing--the short rib tacos, the Korean BBQ Bahn Mi, and the fish tacos, and the jar of kimchi.  The dumplings, while perfect, were not as interesting as the other items."
The shrimp tacos are awesome
"I had to jump on the food trend band wagon with this one, but I am glad I jumped. I have always despised Kimchi and these guys have skewed my outlook on this food component. My wife, close friend and I ordered 6 tacos, kimchie fries and dumplings perfect amount of food and super good value. Pssst they could jack their prices up a smidge and I'd still come.I also discovered they are next door neighbors to my barber shop Floyd's 99 barbershop. This is going to make getting my haircut twice as fun now, because I am definitly gonna stop by after.Short rib taco +++Location+++kimchi fries ++Dumplings-/+ they are a bit on the doughy side. I prefer a Japanese gyoza style dumpling but then again this is probably Korean way."
"Ok so since the last time I wrote, I have been here a handful of times and every visit has been fantastic.  I think the very first time I went it was super busy as it was new and the food is delicious.  The service has improved tremendously (probably because it isn't as psycho crazy or I have just figured out better times to go).  I have to say... i often crave the kimchi fries and i love the shrimp sandwich.  I'm currently scarfing down a bibimbop as i type.  SOO GOOD.  I'm glad i gave this place a second try!"
"When you first walk in, the place has a chipotle-esque feel.  It is also very small with somewhat limited seating.  All the tables were filed and I was coming in for pick up, but if I needed to eat in there would have been issues.  This was around 8:30pm on a Monday night. Very happy for them that they are busy and can keep their tables full.  I tried the bulgogi banh mi and 3/4 tacos that were available (did not have the kalbi).  I basically didn't try all 4 because I thought it would've been an obscene amount of food for 2 people.  Husband had the banh mi and he approved of the bread and all the fillings.  Not sure who they source their bread from, but was VERY happy this passed the test as it is one of the most important aspects of a banh mi. This is coming from a man who grew up 2 blocks away from Argyle and was probably eating banh mi from birth. The tacos were delicious as well, good lettuce/slaw on top and the meats weren't scary.  I actually had some trouble distinguishing the chicken from the pork, but all were very tasty.  Shrimp taco didn't seem very asian to me, but it was a nice change from the marinated meats. None of the tacos very exceptionally spicy, which would be one of my suggestions (offer additional or spicier sauce options).  Get the dumplings.  Need to return to try the pork belly kimchi fries and the bibimbop.  If they can't do bibimbop, this will be a problem.  Hopefully I'll be able to update to 5 stars after a return visit.  So far, so good.  Keep up the good work :)"
"Tasty food at a good value. Have been here twice. Kalbi and Pork tacos were both real yummy. The slaw on them is very good. Shrimp taco was just alright, I wouldn't be getting it again. Second time I went we got the dumplings, bibimbap and bulgogi and they were all quite tasty."
Korean Shrimp Tacos. YUM. Overall a great experience.. but for the hype the tacos were just OK -- they lacked some flavor!
"Coming from a Korean reviewing a Korean restaurant, this place is VERY good and HIGHLY recommended. I stumbled upon this place on Yelp when I had an insane craving for some Korean food last weekend. So I dragged my boyfriend along and decided to give it a whirl since it was so close to where I lived and I am so glad I did! I agree with the other reviewers, the shrimp tacos are very good....probably the best I've ever had.  We also had the pork bbq plate, which comes out on a hot stone with rice and bok choy, and it was also very tasty. The pork dumplings are also delicious and something I definitely would recommend as well. I can't wait to go back! Next time, I will be trying those kimchi fries that everyone has also been raving about."
"Went here on a sunday for dinner. My gf and I got the shrimp, balbi, and BBQ pork tacos with the kimchi fries as a side. The food was good if the whole Korean BBQ fusion is what you like. Our meal was a little more than $20 which I thought was expensive for the amount of food we got. In my opinion worth a try to see if you like the whole Korean BBQ fusion, but a little on the pricey side considering there's other good restaurants in Lincoln park."
"So Good, I have tried the fish, beef and pork tacos.  I only wished that they had a location in Oldtown."
"I give it 2, the hubs gives it 4.  Hmph.We heard the buzz about it.  Korean Mexican Fusion.  Cute.  The only thing mexican about it was the tortilla it was served on.The atmosphere:  small, cramped, restaurant.  We waited awhile before we could get seated.  Boo.  The only thing that opened up was the table by the bathroom.  So we took it.  It was fine.  No strange smells came near us.  But everyone eyed our meal on their way in and out of the bathroom.The food:  we ordered everythingThe dumplings:  delicious, but got sticky.  They seemed like pretty standard gyoza or potstickersThe kimchi pork belly fries:  the hubs was irked by this one.  But pleasantly surprised.  The kimchi wasn't overwhelming like he thought it would be.  But he was underwhelmed with the pork belly.  I asked him if he liked the pork and he responded, ""there was pork in there?""  I guess it was not noticeable with all the other stuff going onAll the tacos:  I liked the shrimp.  He liked the kalbi.  Delicious.  But I remember reading another yelper saying that the topping was the same on them all.  True.  Very monotonous.  The chicken and the pork tasted identical.  I'm assuming the Sandwiches are these meats and marinades on bread instead of a tortilla.  Disappointing.The staff: very nice.  They put our order in a few minutes later in order for us to get a table and get warm food.  And our food was prompt.  What was a surprise was the music. Awesome R&B selection.  Alicia Keys, the Roots, Erykah.  Nice.  I bopped my head a few times.  Overall... tasty but one-note.  I wouldn't rush back to this place."
"This place friended me on facebook, so I felt obliged to visit.I like the korean fusion take on tacos - I've yet to make it to Los Angles to try the original version of these tacos, but hopefully one day.When we got there, there was not much of a line and we were happy to snag a table. And they even have highchairs - good for our toddler. We ordered the kalbi tacos - pretty good. This is prob the item to order.We tried a shrimp bahn mi - so some korean vietnamese fusion. Also tasty.Dol sot bi bim bop -  no fusion and not worth it, migth as well order this at a proper korean place and get some panchan sides. No ""scorched"" rice - perfectly passable, but nothing out of the ordinary.Ganjan fries - nicely fried fries, but nothing I'd dream about.By the time we left, there was a line literally to the door. Not sure why - since this kitchen sent out the food very quickly. Service was good, as good as can be expected for this type of place.my wife had a brilliant idea to order a spicy scallop hand roll from mitch down the street for a dessert. This would presumably also work with a cupcake from Molly. Who would have guessed there could be so much good food on this stretch of Clark??"
"This place was just okay. I was so underwhelmed by the food!! Rather disappointing. Maybe it's because I eat korean food all the time, but this is just what I regularly eat... just put into a taco. The idea of Korean-Mexican fusion is definitely hot right now but this was just not executed as well as I hoped. Also, not as imaginative as I thought it would be. 3 stars is definitely generous.  The kalbi taco was the best thing I had here. The meat was well-marinated and complemented the kimchi slaw well. It would be improved if the meat was cut into smaller pieces like carne asada normally is. The double corn tortilla was kinda excessive and the shrimp taco had too much sesame. The spicy pork bahnmee was just okay.I usually judge a restaurant by how much I crave it after.. and def don't see myself coming back here. I think it's a better choice to head over to Crisp!"
"I was born in Seoul and my mother is Korean, needless to say, I love Korean food. Del Seoul (along with Crisp) is where I go to get my fix.The Korean tacos are good, but I usually go with the Korean BBQ plates. The bulgogi is good, and comes with kimchi, rice, and veggies. Service is quick, and while there isn't a lot of seating, I've never had trouble sitting down and eating. Worth a visit."
"I want to eat the chicken tacos everyday, for the rest of my life!!!Staff are super friendly and helpful..Music is odd but great."
"Ooohh yum!  So glad to see this place go in, Clark needed a Korean place to add to all the other wonderful and diverse places to eat!I had the ribeye steak sandwich (Bulgogi) and it was fab!! Tim had the Bibimbop and he said he would definitely come back for it.  We got a couple bags of their Korean crunchy chip thingies which were a little sweet but they totally grew on me.  The sweet potato chips were the better of the two.Clean, friendly, fresh, and flavorful....we'll be back!  Next time I'm trying the tacos, they looked great!"
"Absolutely delicious. I had spicy pork, with rice and bok choy came with a side of kimchi. Served on a steaming hot plate. I can't wait to go back....starving just thinking about the food here. Is 6 stars available?"
"Tacos:Tried all four flavors (meats) and they were all really, really good! I do think the short rib (kalbi, bone free of course) and the shrimp tacos were my favorite. They fry the shrimp so it's extra tasty!Pork Belly/Kimchi Fries:Thought I would be wow-ed but just thought they were ""fine."" I suppose this is their take on carne asada fries. Good effort but I wasn't entirely impressed. I would have been fine with just plain 'ol fries."
Kimchi fries! Nuff said...
"By far my favorite Korean taco place in Chicago. My family and friends who don't live n Chicago will randomly text me saying they are craving the shrimp tacos, and ask me to ship them some!"
"Delicious Korean tacos...a bit expensive per taco but definitely worth trying. The meat are deliciously marinated, and taste great in their concoction for the taco mix.However, I did not care for the kimchi fries...and I love kimchi! Maybe if all the fries had the spice mixed around...but it's just fries with kimchi laid on top. Mehh.."
"Love it!As an Albany Park AKA Korea Town local, I know what good Korean food is and Del Seoul definitely ranks high on my list. I've been hearing the wonders of this place out in the blogospheree and my fiance and I decided to give it a try. We went on a Friday night and ended up having to circle the neighborhood a couple times to find a convenient parking spot. Del Seoul is nestled in one of my favorite fast-casual foodie blocks in Chicago, sharing parking meter space with yumm-o restaurants like Aloha Grill, Molly's and Toro.Walking into Del Seoul, we were hit with soothing and head bopping old-school hip-hop. LOVE IT! I took this as another clever twist on their namesake .. ""Del Seoul"" and playing homage to hip hop greats like De La Soul. Either way, I love a place where I can throw down on some delicis grub and chill to great tunes. As hungry as we were, the fiance and I tried several items on their menu ... Kalbi tacos, Sesame Shrimp taco, Pork Belly and Kimchi fries, Bulgogi Bahn-Mi and washed everything down with Coconut Juice. Everything was absolutely delicious with my faves being the Shrimp Tacos (perfect blendy of tanginess and crunch) and the Pork Belly and Kimchi fries (flavors didn't over overpower, complemented perfectly.)  I love the fact that they've kept the flavors fairly traditional, but added their own ""flavor"" to make their menu items mainstream and unique. The fiance loved Del Seoul so much, we went there again a few days later to re-sample the tacos and try out the Bibimbop. Delicious!"
"So I have visited this place twice already.  And even though, I am only giving this 3 stars...I would defintely go back again and try some more stuff out. I am just not super impressed yet....I mean, I may be impressed later on.I did enjoy the Bibimbop with the ribeye steak...the flavor was really good (but I did make my own sauce instead of using theirs--my friend thought this was highly amusing.On my second trip I ordered a Shrimp taco...which I did really enjoy...I loved the way the shrimp was breaded.  I also had to try the Banh Mi with ribeye steak.  I do have to tell you that the marinate on the steak is really tasty...but there was something missing for me and I just can't see to get my finger on it at all.  The Porkbelly fries were my least favorite item....I did not see or taste any porkbelly and I did not like the cabbage in there at all.  Would I try this again?  Maybe...without the cabbage thoughDel Seoul...I will be back and I am hoping that with the new items coming that something will have my mouth watering for more!"
"This sounds silly but it is serious, there is a sign on the door that says watch your step...WATCH YOUR STEP AS YOU WALK IN!There is this insignificant step that trips so many people coming in, it is almost comical.The food here is sent from the Korean Gods!I had the Sesame Chili Shrimp Taco that words cannot describe how good it was. The taco has so many different textures from the slaw, and the panko crumbs on the shrimp, yum. This taco is bursting with flavor. I definetly reccommend it. You cannot leave here without getting the Seoul street style dumplings. If you do not get them you will be staring at everyone around you eating this mysterious dumpling that is kept  in a mini steamer, wondering if you can have one of theirs. We also had the seasoned Gamja fries and those were really good as well. I love this place and love that I work walking distance to it!If you are headed to Wrigleyville I would stop here first and grab a bite."
I went here last week with friends and it was delicious!  Plus desert right down the block at mollys yummm!
"Place is just OK. My order consisted of two tacos (grilled short rib) and the dumplings. Dumplings were undercooked and somewhat cold, but I could tell the quality is pretty good. On the tacos I asked for flour tortillas opposed to the corn and it was like you were asking them to give up their first born. nice guy at the register had to walk to the back and ask the manager who agreed to it but made sure to let me know that ""this is a one time accommodation"". Come on Really? *I got the food home and when we opened up the tacos they were on corn. Food was overpriced ($13), the fact that the place had 5 signs stating you were not to seat yourself (yes they will assign you a seat) and the fact they messed up the order took this place from OK to I've had better. Enjoy *****Update****** I have to give the management Kudos for reaching out and taking responsibility. Just because of this I will give the place another shot and we'll try something different.10/17/11Tried this place again when I was in town last weekend. Food was pretty good this time. I had the tacos (shrimp) and the fries. I would reccommend anyone to eat in house since my food was much better fresh from the kitchen."
"Popped in on Saturday before catching a movie at the Century.  It was 6 PM and fairly quiet -- I was able to get a table immediately.  I really wish I was with a group because I wanted to try most of the menu.  Had the kalbi and chili shrimp tacos.  Excellent flavor.  Was really happy that each came with two tortillas so that I could avoid jamming the whole thing in my mouth.  Be warned -- there are only nine tables at Del Seoul so either take-out, go early or be prepared to wait.  Super duper casual.  I'll be back.  Those kimchi pork belly fries are calling my name."
"If you're craving bibimbop Del Seoul will hit the the spot, just don't go in with any sort of fine dining expectations.  While the place is clean and bright, there's no personality or ambiance to speak of.  It's basically the Korean equivalent to a fast food place.We didn't have any of the fusion-type dishes, just stuck traditional with the bibimbop.  It was the bf's first time trying bibimbop, and I think Del Seoul was a good introduction for him.  As cheap as I am, I ponied up the extra buck for the del sot version of bibimbop, which is served in a hot stone-esque bowl.  I suggest you do the same - the rice crisps in the del sot bowl, creating a burnt rice layer that is oh-so-good and the highlight of the dish.  My only complaint is that it would have been nice if the place allowed the egg in the bibimbop to cook in the hot bowl.  When I visited Korea, the bibimbop I remembered was served with raw eggs that were cracked and put into the dish table-side.  The eggs at Del Seoul, however, are pre-fried and just plopped on top of the bibimbop, which isn't quite as fun or authentic feeling."
"This being my first Korean taco experience, I do not have much to compare this place to, but I will say that I enjoyed it.  I ordered 1 Kalbi and 1 Pork BBQ taco with a side of Kimchi fries.  After the cashier took my order, I was given a metal post with a number sign at the top.  I've seen this system before at Noodles and Co, Corner Bakery, etc.  The service was pretty fast, but I also entered the restaurant as they were opening up for business at 11:30am.  By noon, there was a sizable line and the table space was dwindling.2 tacos and fries were more than enough for 1 person.  I really loved this place and will definitely be back!"
i love tacos. esp fish tacos. and del seoul has good ones.ive tried a handful of other ones and theyre good too.
"I went here last night for some tacos and also tried the kimchi and pork belly fries.  The fries were good, though I'll probably stick with the tacos in future visits--they were great!  The service was friendly and everything was very fresh.  The atmosphere is fairly bland, but it's a taco place so it was in line with expectations.  I tried all four types of tacos (beef, pork, chicken, and shrimp) and it was hard to pick a favorite.  They all had very similar ingredients, so it pretty much came down to the protein you prefer.  The (slight) standouts for me were the shrimp and chicken tacos.I'm going to have to come back to try the dumplings and maybe the banh mi.  I also love bibimbap at other places, but I don't love mushrooms (I hate them, in fact), so I'll probably stay away from it here."
"Now that I think about it, I've never really had Korean BBQ before. Or much Korean food at all. But after reading about Del Seoul in my daily Tasting Table newsletter (subscribe! it's awesome!) I was dying to try it. Bonus - it's 5 blocks from my apartment and next door to one of my other favorite little fast food joints - Lito's Empanadas!However, I was pretty disappointed. Maybe I'm just not cut out for Korean food or kimchi. For over $10 my carry out dinner included the pork belly and kimchi fries and 1 pork taco. It wasn't an outrageous amount of food, so the price is a little much based on portions alone. The fries weren't anything special - not sure if I like kimchi and there wasn't a ton of pork on it. The taco was decent but honestly nothing to rave over. I'd much rather take my money to Big Star for the same dish, but better.Maybe I'll give it another chance, maybe not. Certainly won't go out of my way. Staff was friendly though and the place is clean."
"Yum! I had the kalbi and shrimp tacos and the spicy bbq pork plate.  It was love at first bite! The service was quick and the place is fairly small but clean.The shrimp taco is a must-have! Two delicious, panko covered shrimp topped with delicious veggies.  If you're starving, you should definitely get 2 or 3 tacos or 1 taco with the bbq pork plate.  I've recommended this place to everyone!"
"Oof, I wanted to not like it, but Asian flavors are too easy to like in fusion-y concepts.The tacos are great.  And they're super cheap.  They're good too.  My favorite is the shrimp taco (deep fried, so you get the texture contrast unlike the other 3 tacos). The slaw is somehow just the right complement for the meats.Skip the banh mi, the bread is subpar.  The steamed dumplings are like crappy xiao long baos.  They really push the french fries, but I think thats just their play to improve their average profit margin (french fries cost damn near zero to make).So basically I'm giving a 4 star review while saying that they only do one thing right, but dammit, that one thing is their namesake so I'll stand by it (they are a Korean TACO joint, right?)."
"Omg.  Yum!Don't try to eat and drive... Got a bit messy in the car.  I was skeptical, but DH convinced me... Boy was it good.  A little kick to the tacos, a welcome burn on the tongue.Got the shrimp tacos and the bulgogee.Will get againAdditional info after we visited again.  This time we went in to eat with our girls and a good friend.  Food was great.  Had a Plate, which was good.  The dumplings were also very good.  Nice selection of different drinks, from Coke Products to Korean beverages.  Parent's NoteThey do have a Kid's Bowl Option.  We got our 2 yo the chicken one.  It comes with a pile of their slightly Pickled slaw, A big pile of rice and about a breast worth of diced chicken.  A tiny bit dry (as usually the case in most restaurants) and was a bit spicy.  May have been more appropriate for a 5 yo, but a little much for a 2 yo.  She ate all the rice and a bit of the chickenthat I took off the outer layer.  Husband ate the rest!As expected in LP, no changing table.  Small bathroom but clean.  Used the floor for the 7 mo, standing for the 2 yo."
"This place is addicting. I've been here 5 times in the last 10 days. My favorite is their shrimp tacos.  But I'd honestly eat anything on their menu. I preferred their garlic fries over their kimchi fries. Great service, quick service.  So good, I can't say enough great things about this place."
"Korean food is a terribly under-available thing in the more central parts of Chicago. Unless you want to trek out to Albany Park for bountiful bibimbap, you'd be hard-pressed to find even so much as a decent jar of kimchi anywhere except the Korean super-supermarket on Kimball.Del Seoul doesn't exactly bridge the river between Lincoln Park/Lakeview and good Korean Food. Rather, it is a high-speed train trip between Chicago and the street cuisine of L.A. that surely inspired this restaurant.Enough banchan -- let's get to the barbecued meat already. There's plenty of it -- either nestled in a fistful of cabbage, squooshed inside bahn mi, or on a plate all by itself for individual savoring.One of our favorite dishes, the dumplings, was a total surprise to me. Here I was, thinking the only place to get a decent dumpling in this world was the East, and along comes a plate of six transporting orbs of goodness. There is one weakness here: the taco shells. Because the filling ingredients are heaped so heartily, they employ two flour-flavored, cold, tough pieces of tortilla instead of something more culturally relevant, like neighboring China's chun bing (pancakes) or even the bing's thicker brother who lives in Korea: the pajeon.Late one Sunday night, Daniel and I spent $28 here and stretched it into two and a half meals together. Easily. (Despite our deceptively slim waistlines, we can eat quite ravenously when the food is good).The spices are on the lighter side here, and without a cup of raw garlic to purify all that is evil inside of me, I'm not totally convinced that this ""Korean"" restaurant really exists without the quotation marks of novelty and trendiness. But it's still one place I'd return to again and again."
"Went here last night with two of my friends after one of our other friends raved about this place. Apparently it's BYOB, which is cool.I'm always a bit skeptical about trying new foods (I used to eat chicken fingers whenever I went out to eat for years) but this was pleasantly surprising. We placed our order and then had to wait a few minutes for a table to open up (which is probably the only con of this place) but once we sat down we got our food almost right away.We ordered some of the Seoul Style street dumplings to split, which were yummy. My friend and I both got a Kalbi taco and sesame-chicken shrimp taco; they were packed and a bit messy to eat, but worth it. Our other friend got the Bulgogi sandwich. Both of the tacos were delicious, but I personally preferred the Kalbi taco. Our friend finished his sandwich before either of us finished our tacos so I'm guessing that was pretty good too.My recommendation: I was pretty hungry and two tacos was more than enough for me. And I can eat.It was a good base for the impromptu bar crawl that followed on our walk home."
"Wow what a great idea to make a Korean taco. I went up here for the first time with a buddy. I wanted to check this out from the moment he told me about it. Let me tell you, it was amazing. I tried the chicken, shrimp, and beef tacos. The shrimp i thought was a little dry, but the beef and chicken were great. The beef is my favorite. It has this sweet flavor then the spicy cabbage is on top."
"Though Del Seoul can draw a big crowd on the weekends, the tables turn over pretty quickly. It's hard to go wrong with anything on the menu here, but the Sesame-Chili Shrimp Tacos are awesome."
"Heard so much about this place that I just had to try it.  Good Fast Food - loved their Gamja Fries and the Shrimp Banh Mi - we ordered so much (3 kinds of tacos, kimchi fries, bibimbop...) I pretty much tried their entire menu!My daughter raved about it so I guess I expected more from it... the tacos were so-so and the kimchi fries were different...but it lacked the twist I had hoped it would have....But I'd go back....after all food is pretty good, and the prices are GREAT!"
"Korean BBQ is delicious.Mexican food is also very delicious. So why not fuse the two? Del Seoul gets 3 stars in my opinion for several reasons..Flavors:The flavors are pretty good, not exactly what I think of right away when I reflect on my experiences with Korean food. They tend to use gojuchang (pepper/bean paste) as a basis for seasoning. Nothing wrong with that.. it's very well on its way to becoming the new sriracha. But nothing was really standout and WOW for me. If anything their slaw that they topped their tacos with didn't really help boost flavors, in fact they kind of muddled them.  I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to grab a taco here, but I'll take one if offered to me.I do however have an issue with their pork tacos.They just weren't really what I expected. Their decision to grill strips of pork really didnt do much for the dish. When I get pork tacos other than al pastor, I really look forward to really succulent and luscious shredded pork (carnitas style) I found the pork here to be rather dry..They could stand to grill their tortillas a little more as my tacos came out just above lukewarm. A friend of mine got the gamba fries..I wasn't really that impressed either.And another friend got their (loose interpretation of) Bahn Mi.- Sorry, I dont think I'll ever spend more than $3.50  on a bahn mi sandwich and Del Seoul's cheapest one is $5.75.Accuse me of counting pennies, but I could totally get a dac biet bahn mi at Nhu Lan's bakery with a smoothie. (that's a killer steal!)If they adjusted their prices accordingly.. I might give them another try. I know they're stationed in an area that's otherwise, pretty well off but there are also a lot of college kids out there. Oh, and don't get me started on their outrageous markups on junk foods .. (shrimp chips, soft drinks from the far east) **hint: a quick trip to the markets on argyle/broadway will prove to be more gratuitous.. and there's the element of adventure in it to boot!**"
"Crazy good!  The Kim Chee salad is awesome...one of those foods you never had but know you'll like before you even try it. Service was excellent and very prompt. Hint, if you are on a budget and diet get a kids meal very very reasonable...but I'm not sure if they''ll sell you one with out kids...maybe get it to go."
"Del Seoul is just one block away from my building, I didn't notice this place until there is an article introducing must-go restaurant  in the Chicago Reader. When I first come to Del Seoul I ordered bibimbop to go and I thought the place is small; however, it didnt impress me to much for the fisrt time.   After a couple weeks, Del Seoul expaned next door. The restaurant seems much more spacious than before, I decided to give it another try . This time, my friend recommed Korean tacos, what? Korean BBQ tacos? I never heard  of it before, however, I ordered Kalbi tacos, it  totally won me over!!   My friend said kimichi fires is flavorful and most yelpers reconmmend kalbi vietnamese sandwich is delicious as well, I will  try both of them next time.I am so glad there is a pretty cool restaurant near my place. I will be definitely going back when I have a craving for Korean food!! Anyway, I will bring my firend to this spot for sure."
"This is an area I find mildly annoying, so when I say I have - multiple times, mind you - come here just for a few tacos due to mad cravings, it's a compliment.  In fact, only an hour ago, I was overcome by one such desire.  So naturally, I briskly left my Logan Square abode, cruised through the rain, drove parking circles for 20 minutes, wondered why I didn't take the L, did more parking circles, cursed Lincoln Park for all of eternity to any and all gods that would listen, and eventually... I basked in a shrimp taco so heavenly, it washed all else away, as did the rain to the bird shit on my '89 Buick.The shrimp are large, tender, and battered lightly.  Perfectly crispy.  But eat it there, or in the car as I did tonight, because the lettuce and sauce will slowly but surely morph crunchiness into sogginess.  No one wants that.  The kalbi is my second fav, but the tacos are all good.  I just wish they differed the toppings on each to fit the meat, they're pretty much the same.  On first taste, it was difficult to decipher the difference between the kalbi and the bbq pork because the meat flavorings and the toppings were so similar.  The bahn mi are delicious.  The dumplings are very good.  The dough is thin and delicate, very fresh and tender, compared to many thick and chewy doughy dumplings out there.  But they seem to separate and fall apart on two bite attacks, so just down them whole - I know you can take it.  Great dipping sauce, I love it's tang so much, I enjoy sipping tiny sups of it.  (Yeah, I know where you're going worth that one, I already beat you there.)  But the take out containers have so little in them, it barely coats the bottom, not nearly enough.  Ask for two.I worship at the shrine of Asian food, and find most anything fused with it to be irresistible, so this place is all thumbs up for me.  Although it's a stretch to call the tacos Korean-Mexican fusion, because it's really just Korean food on a tortilla.  The Korean-Vietnamese bahn mi seem to me logical and perfectly fit.  I have yet to try the bibimbop in stone, but it's coming next.Last tip - afterwards, saunter down the block to Molly's cupcakes.  The peach cobbler cupcake is my usual finisher after Del Seoul, the light and fresh whipped cream and fruitiness is the perfect palate partner to vinegary Korean flavors."
"Great, just great.  Had all the tacos, each one was better than the next.  Our favorite was the fish taco.  We also had the Bulgogi Platter , also, amazing.  We are already looking at the menu to see what we are going to get the next time."
Since my last review I've been back many times and been pleased each time. The food is delicious and spot on every time. The hot stone bibimbop is amazing as well. Yum!
"Del Seoul will definitely become a regular stop for me.  The shrimp taco rocked!  The kalbi was also delicious and i'm definitely excited to try the other ones.  I had some of my friend's dumplings and I thought they were OK.  I think I waited too long to try them so they had gotten cold and the wrapper had gotten slightly hard.Kimchi fries are worth the hype!The only minus is the ordering/table system.  Luckily there were tables when we arrived, but when we were done, there were multiple groups just standing around waiting for tables."
"So I owed my lazy friend a lunch/dinner because she gave me a  ride to the train station :) And we decided to go here.It was an adventure (MISSION) to get to the place riding trains,and buses,and the cold,and the sore legs .....but it was worth it.The place is simple and straight forward.Small menu,but its about quality here.I tried the pork and steak tacos and the banh mi steak sammich.First of all,the tacos confused my taste buds into thinking I was eating asian food,but then the tortilla and meat were recognized as ""taco flavors"",it was great.There is a really simple,yet unique taste to the tacos here.The Banh mi was also packed with veggies and flavor.Tho I WAS FORCED to share half of mine, that half tasted very fresh and overall deliscious.And the food was very ""pretty"" haha.I do recommend this place for a nice quick lunch ,and Id def travel the distance to eat here again ."
what a great place!  have been here a few timesthe kalbi plate is good but the best dish here is shrimp tacos!!!kalbi tacos are good. i just love kalbi i'll take it any way i can get it.  the fries w/ aoli is pretty good but you must have a shrimp taco here (sorry peeps w/ shrimp allergies- i'll have another for you).yum yum yum!!

"Kimchi here was a bit disappointing...it wasn't very spicy. The tacos are really small, but I guess they are cheap. They aren't very authentic Korean food, but they still taste good. The bibimbap was not the best I've had...might have been the bibimbap sauce...or maybe it's the combo of veggies in it. The meat tasted good, but I wish it wasn't in such big chunks...maybe if it was more shredded into the bibimbap, the overall bibimbap would have been better. I didn't try the soon du bu (spicy tofu soup) but I heard it was decent."
"So i starved until almost 8pm to rush over here after a meeting and man was it worth it! I was glad cause by then the rush had ended and i got a table and ate comfortably. you could tell the staff was pooped from a busy day but the food was great! i ate the bulgogi banmi, gamja fries, spicy bbq pork taco, spicy chicken taco and kalbi taco! all the spices were great and went well with the mexican spices! i wanted to get the dumplings but of course they had run out, lol. i missed out on the crazy french fries but i will get that next time. i need to try to bibimbap next time and will probably be back this weekend! definitely try it! this place will get better and better as they get used opening a new resturant! =)"
"I had never really had an experience or knowledge of Korean food, but what I've been introduced to here in the city, I can definitely say that I am a fan. I ordered 3 types of Korean BBQ tacos and was blown away. The pulled pork and beef steak tacos were my favorites. I wasn't really impressed with the chicken one, or the kamichi fries I ordered. Some of the seasonings and spices on those fries are definitely an acquired taste. I got my order to go and thought it was moderately priced. As far as dining in goes, I can't say much. I walk by there everyday coming home from work and I noticed that they recently expanded their dining area to accommodate their patrons."
"I will admit the tacos here are very good (Kalbi, BBQ Pork) but I still find it on the expensive side for it being close to $3 a taco. One isn't enough to satisfy my hunger, more like 4 would actually make me feel just right. Then again, there's no other place like it in Chicago. But I couldn't bear give this place a 3 because like I said, the food is very good. I recommend the kimchi fries (kind of deceiving though, there's not a whole lot of kimchi in it), large enough to split for 2. I've never encountered a crowd during my eats, but it's always been a late lunch for me here."
There is nothing like Del Seoul in Lincoln Park that is this good. Recommend the different tacos as they each taste a little different and have tons of flavor.
"Oh Del Seoul, you sure are tasty...I was coming home from work on the CTA one day and was sitting between two chix talking about how they, ""Were sooo excited to go to Del Seoul and try the dumplings....yadadadada."" Shut it girls. Anywho, the next week when the man friend and I were looking for a spot for some grub, I remembered the awkward, eavesdropping I was partaking in only weeks earlier. Thanks girls!Positives:Yes the dumplings were good, and they came on a cute little steamer plate.The tacos were awesome. I tried three different types, my favorite was the shrimp one.The man's sandwich was phenomenal.Negatives:Not BYOB and they don't serve booze...please get a liquor license of some sort people...you live a neighborhood of alcoholic De Paul students!"
"Hadn't been to this place in about a year, was in the hood so I dropped in to check on its progress.  Color me impressed.  The food is still as good as I remembered, the fusion of korean bbq and mexican/vietnamese/american dishes is done well.  The aspects of each style are not muted by the others but a really good balance and blend, isn't that what fusion should really be?  My previous reservations with this place were that it was quite small and since the food is good and not too expensive, it is usually packed, making it almost impossible to actually sit down and eat there at common eating times.  Since my past visits this place has expanded, and now the dining area is spacious, plentiful, and the operations side of the restaurant are run like a well oiled machine.As far as the menu is concerned, it's all good.  All the taco flavors are amazing, ditto for the Banh Mis.  The kim chi fries are delicious, but are definitely for sharing (unless you are gross like me).  I do think that the Banh Mi sandwiches are superior to the tacos, but this is mostly a value issue and not necessarily a taste issue (I think 3 tacos = 1 banh mi in terms of belly satisfaction).  The korean and japanese snacks sold along side the food are a total ripoff, but you're paying for convenience I suppose, it's a ways to mitsuwa/chinatown/argyle for your shrimp flavored junk food.Overall really pleased with this place, glad to see it's doing well and the expansion has really made everything better.  This place has gone from an ""in the neighborhood"" dine to a destination dine."
"After walking by this intriguing Korean-fusion joint a week ago and hearing from a friend about it today, a bunch of us decided to make a trip for lunch to see what the hype was all about. Unfortunately, that's all there was. Maybe I expected too much or maybe I was looking for something more authentically Korean. Either way, I was disappointed. While I do love the creative concept and applaud the owners efforts, I believe there needs to be more improvement in the execution. The tacos had too much slaw and the marinated meat required more char to it. (I know I could have brushed off the vegies) I wished I had the option to put some kind of gojugang sauce or grilled kimchi instead of sriracha. The Vietnamese sandwiches were not really distinctively different than something similar I can get for cheaper on Argyle Street. Again, I would love to get a side of grilled kimchi to put in it.  Lastly, the pork and kimichi needed to be grilled more on top of the good, but limited number of fries. The only thing that I liked was the dumplings that my wife said tastes similar to what her mom would make it. (yes...being Korean and a snob can often be synonymous) Keeping in mind of the trendy neighborhood that it sits in and the non-Korean clientele that this unique place is attracting, it has great potential. Seating can be limited at nights and I do like the urban hip environment. In addition, they offer various Korean snacks and canned drinks. If I lived around here, I'd be tempted to buy the sandwiches because I'm too lazy to drive up to Vietnamese town. What we ordered:- Kalbi tacos- spicy pork tacos- shrimp tacos - decent- dumplings - recommend - Vietnamese bulgogi sandwich- Vietnamese spicy pork sandwich- pork kimichi fries - decentWhen we went:1:30 PM SundayWill we return:- until it improves, not worth the drive"
"I heard about this place before among my Korean friends, so when the empanada place was closed after 9, I saw this place and decided to try. We had kalbi taco and shrimp taco, kalbi plate and kimchi fries. I am a Korean and lived there for around 16 years, so I am very picky on Korean restaurant cus I am used to home made Korean meal at home or back home. I've never tried the Kalbi taco before though.. I heard it's popular in CA. Anyways,, the kalbi taco was really good.. I like the shrimp taco even more!I really like the kimchi fries. If you like kimchi, make sure try the kimchi fries!!!Kalbi plate was ok.. nothing great. I can just buy Kalbi meat from the korean market and cook at home and it would be same or better.I plan to make kale taco and kimchi fries myself at home since I found the recipe on internet.Food is good there. Make sure you try these tacos and fries.."
"I originally cringed at the idea of Korean - Mexican mix, but was pleasantly surprised by Del Seoul. I had the shrimp taco and kalbi taco, I think the shrimp was my favorite and based on the reviews here, I'm not surprised. Good food, fun flavors, interesting mix and definitely something cool to try if you're bored with food in general."
Best Korean tacos I have ever eaten... I was reluctant to try tacos w/o sour cream (I know ridiculous) but OMG I love this place & feel a lot healthier eating them! I crave these tacos on a regular basis (& only like $2 each)... :)
What can I say? Their Korean tacos are the best in town! My recommendations must be the shrimp and beef tacos.  My husband cannot get enough of the shrimp banh mi sandwiches.  It took me a long time to break away and finally try something new - the spicy chicken taco.  It is amazing but I still love the beef and shrimp.  Perhaps I'll try the sandwiches next!
The slaw and secret sauce are fabulous!  Shrimp tacos are great.  Chicken tacos were a bit fatty for my tastes.
i have never written a review.....with that being said...i felt compelled to write a review about del seoulit was absolutely amazingmy husband had the fish taco....i had the shrimp taco......and then we split the bahn mi.....im from houston and lived right outside of NYC where both places have great asian food and this far surpassed anything i could have expected.....bahn mi was def the best i have ever had...and the fish taco/shrimp taco is just too good to describe.....service was nice and very fast! i hope they open up more in the north and all over....and i def will tell more people about this place.....
"I was yelping as usual trying to find new joints to eat at in the city of cold.  And surprisingly i see this place that was coming soon and couldnt wait.Grand opening, first thing i bought was the Kalbi, Spicy BBQ Pork, & Spicy BBQ Chicken.  These tacos were by far the best tacos I had, and probably could be better if i was drunk heheh. But anyways, I then bought the dumplings, but they were ok.  They actually taste like any other dumpling in the world.The next I came along with my girlfriend.  She bought the same items I had before, but for me I had to try the sandwiches and the one I thought was the best were the spicy BBQ Chicken.  That was also delicious and also a bit refreshing with the vegetables included.All in all, all of the foods were absolutely satisfying and worth to eat.  The sandwiches were good.  I was expecting a little heat since it was Korean food.  Unfortunately, there was a little kick, but not as hot as I expected.  However, there was one thing that I did not like and that was the Kimchi Fries.  There really was not anything exciting about but just Kimchi and Fries that have no relation.  If you are a first timer, order the tacos and then continue down the menu.  The Cons about the place is it is so small.  I guess they would have never expected their place to be so popular.  Hopefully there will be a food truck.  (praying)"
"It's not a Los Angeles Korean Taco truck, but it's the closest thing you're going to find in the Midwest.I went with a friend to try it out and we ordered almost the whole menu.1.  The Shrimp tacos are awesome, they are a must order.2.  Spicy pork tacos are great.3.  I would pass on the sandwiches, basically a lot of the same ingredients that are in the tacos, that don't taste as good on a roll.4.  I didn't particularly like the Kimchi fries.  Seem's a bit out of character for a taco joint.  If you have ever eaten from a Kogi taco truck in LA, you need to check this place out.  It is almost as good!"
"As someone who has been on a persistent quest to find a decent vietnamese sandwich in Chicago, I can finally rest easy because here it is!  This compliment shouldn't be taken lightly, as, in the last year, I have eaten at banh mis at five different Chicago establishments and, while all alright, they just couldn't compare to their New York counterparts.I definitely recommend the spicy pork banh mi sandwich and kimchi fries.  Both are amazing.  The line can sometimes get long at peak lunch and dinner times, but with the recently expanded seating, it's not nearly as difficult to get a table as it used to be.Definitely worth trying!"
"The food here is pretty good!  The kalbi tacos were definitely something new when I tried it and it was amazing!  I think the fusion of different types of food is very interesting.  A little pricey, but still tastes great.  I think it's a good place to try new things!"
Spectacular food. Definitely have to try kimchi fries - a very memorable combination.
"My wife and I went for lunch on a Sunday at Noon - there was plenty of seating inside - we were actually surprised to see how big the place was - it's larger than we thought!  For comparison, it's MUCH larger than Lito's next door.For the two of us, we ordered four tacos (one of each that Del Seoul makes) plus the Kimchi fries.  All the tacos were great - the Kimchi fries were good, but I won't get them again - I think the idea sounds great, but they were just OK.  Next time we'll try the homemade potstickers."
"Wow! AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! I seriously do not know why I waited so long to try this place out. Hubby and I ventured out to Lincoln Park area today and ordered one spicy chicken taco, one bulgogi taco, one kalbi taco and one spicy shirmp taco along with an order of the bulgogi rice plate. Each taco was $2.75 to $2.95 and the rice plate was $11. The tacos came out first and OMG one bite and I was in heaven. This is by far one of the best restaurants I've come across in the Chicago area. The tacos were so good we had to get a second order of each taco. (Yes, I know that's a lot of food but I had eaten nothing all day and I was just starving at that point) Del Seoul definitely hit the right spot and I can't wait to go back. Next time we'll skip the rice plate and get the tacos. The rice plate although good, it was nothing special and the bulgogi is actually more authentic at other Korean restaurants and not at Del Seoul where it's Korean Fusion. Also, although we didn't try it, the pork belly and garlic fries looked damn good and we're definitely gonna get it next time. Nom Nom Nom!"
"My bus was running late and the place was packed and super busy, so I only had one half of my boyfriend's taco here before we headed off to a bar.  I'm not even sure which taco it was on the menu - but those four bites were amazingly delicious.  The beef was tender and juicy, and the veggies on top were delightfully crispy and flavorful.  I'll totally be back!"
"My husband and I will almost always bring out of town friends and guests to Del Seoul. I love how easily you're able to order, sit down (if seats are available, sometimes it's just so crowded from popularity), and get your food within minutes. I love the tacos, kalbi and shrimp are my favorites. We always get the kimchi fries on the side. And lately we've been ordering the ancient secret recipe dumplings and they are really good. As an American born Korean, the food here is pretty darn awesome. And not to mention the awesome pricing!! (Hence why we'll bring our guests over ;) No, but really, this place is excellent in taste and convenience. Highly recommended! :)"
Sesame Chilli Shrimp tacos are definitely worth the hype. Delicious!
"Cheap.  Fast.  Utterly delicious.Tried all 4 of their tacos and a stone bowl bibimbop.  The tacos are all kinda big (a solid 4 bites) and pretty similarly tasty - I probably liked the pork one best.  Just plain awesome.  The bibimbop at $9 for a hot stone bowl was a steal, and one of the best I've had - period.  And I've been to Korea.  I'm used to getting these in smaller bowls - this one was huge.  All in all, got a great dinner for two for less than $27."
"Now, I'm just sayin'... Not sure how or where the inspiration of this idea came to be... but those of us with with a taste for Korean and Mexican food, have either been anticipating this or have been really surprised by just how good this combination is. - Taco's filled with Korean tastiness. Not only tasty, but darn cheap too.- Fries with kimchee, cheese, and pork belly (i.e. basically bacon).... I found out my cholesterol is 157 about a few weeks ago. You wanna know what this means? Bacooooooon!! More Bacooooon!!!!I'd like to ponder and think that one day a long time ago, some hungry korean-american feller went to the fridge and found only bool gogi, kimchi, taco shells and hot saracha sauce and to their sadness, there was not a single grain of rice in the house. As a result they just kind of had to make do with what they had... and by accident... Well, something happened. The Korean Taco was invented... and the world had shed a joyful tear in the creation of this simple, but yet, delicious combination. It's an inter-ethnic fusion/match made in... probably somebody's kitchen at 3am when they probably knew they that had procrastinated for too long on the grocery shopping... Of course, that's just what I'd like to think... Perhaps, I should probably ask the owners one day, how all this came to be...Anyways, eat it!!! it's good!! It's madness! Can you hear you any doubt in my voice? .... probably not! So just eat! and enjoy, fellow yelpers ;)"
"SO GOOD! I've been there three times already, and I've tried the shrimp taco, pork belly fries, and the bibimbop!The shrimp tacos and pork belly fries are my favorite thus far! Good prices - only thing that I'm disappointed with is that it's such a small place with limited seating. But, that's all! I love the food and am looking forward to new items to try!"
"We checked out Del Seoul, specifically beacuse of the great reviews on here, and because we were sitting in a Starbucks about a block away, and were tired of trying to figure out where to go.I see how many 4- and 5-stars this place gets, and I feel like a dark cloud with my mere 3-stars. Let's begin, shall we?My biggest complaint is that the place has a very sterile atmosphere; it would make your corner Panera feel warm and luxurious in comparison. Don't get me wrong, it's very clean and orderly, but perhaps it would feel less out of place in an airport. It's like the type of environment BF Skinner would create to see if he could alienate an infant monkey from its mother. On a positive note, the bathrooms were in great condition.The food ... given that they feature tacos with Korean ingredients, the name Del Seoul is clever, but other than the tortilla they use on the taco, I don't get any other Latin influence on the place.I ordered three of the kalbee beef tacos and one of the Sambal fish tacos. I ate the fish taco first.  It was huge; I was worried it would be too spicy for my eastern European genetics, but it wasn't and it was very tasty. The kalbee tacos were served on corn tortillas with a napa cabbage slaw.  The beef was good, but I found the slaw lacking a brightness of flavor.  I thought it was a lack of acid in the vinagrette the use on the dressing, and I went to the counter to ask for a wedge of lime or lemon, which i thought would have made a real improvement. But, in the words of the manager, ""We don't have any citrus."" They were all perfectly polite and attentive, but I still found it frustrating. Frankly I think the tacos would be ideal for a late night snack after an evening out dancing and drinking, but they're not open that late.I also ordered the seasoned gamja fries, but barely touched them.  They were fine, but I ordered too much food and the fries weren't good enough to warrant the distended abdomen discomfort. My partner got the Spicy Tofu Hotpot and the kimchee fries.  Overall he liked his food, but speaking as an Asian himself, he felt the food was toned down for non-Asian taste buds. He was pleased to find they used the ""correct"" type of tofu for his dish, but he was a little frustrated by the grit he noticed from the shellfish in his entree.  Nevertheless, he did say that he actively noticed morsels of each of the various types of seafood promised in the dish.  His real complaint was that the kimchee not spicy enough.  He described it as having a shadow of the correct flavor.  As for the much lauded kimchee fries, he said they were tasty and that he would recommend them to others, but he said the experience was more about the new combination of flavors, than a mind-blowing taste experience.  He didn't think he'd order it again, but he would recommend it to others who hadn't tried it.  Much like the kimchee served with his entree, he said the kimchee on the fries tasted more like pickled cabbage than fermented cabbage.  He theorized that they might use the quick-kimchee preparation method, which would allow them to make a lot more kimchee in a lot less time.Overall the food was good, and I think we'd both go back, but it's wouldn't be on our list of ""must returns."""
"This is in response to the reviewer who wrote ,""CAUTION: YOU MAY BE PERSONALLY HUMILIATED IN FRONT OF ALL THE PATRONS!!""I was the couple in front of you waiting for a table that is also pregnant & in my 3rd trimester and is over 40 weeks. I was tired as well and walked from my condo.  There are signs all over clearly stating the policy; and yes, policies need to be enforced.  Everyone in the entire restaurant, including myself waited patiently (for less than 5 minutes) until a table was available.  As you were sitting there the staff respectfully approached you and quietly talked to you.  You were not be personally humiliated in front of all the patrons but, treated with respect and courtesy by everyone there. Your husband said you're leaving and not waiting and no one noticed anything until your husband started making a scene and stated ""you're going not going to get nice review on yelp!""  Since the tables turn very quick there, it's too bad you didn't wait 2 minutes to enjoy a awesome meal as Del Seoul.Great food, great staff and simple seating rule most people can follow."
Their Bahn Mi sandwiches are some of the best sandwiches I have ever crammed into my mouth. They sounded a little weird at first but my friend told me if I didn't like it he would pay for it. I have since made the same offer to several friends and haven't had to pay up yet!
"The Shrimp and Pork tacos OWN!!!  And for less than $3.00 a piece?  Come on, this is a bad (yet amazing) habit in the making.  The people were super nice, and professional, and didn't mind my long period of indecision followed by the ordering of one of every taco.   I know it's a small thing, and SHOULD be expected every where, but the place was also clean, which gave it the fifth star, so many places right now in the city are filthy.  I'm pretty stoked on this place."
"The shrimp taco is very tasty and we also loved the dumplings, kimchi fries, and miso soup.   Great place to eat!"
AMAZING bibimbop and their sesame chili shrimp taco is to die for!! Kimchi fries like no other!!!! This place is a must stop!! You will not be disappointed. EVER!!!!!!
Delicious! Tried the bibimbap it was great. Kimchi fries not for me. Too heavy/greasy/salty/pile of lard. Gotta try the tacos next time.
"LOOOOVED this place! Wow the best tacos I ever had, totally worth the money....yes the place is small and you do have to be fast to grab your table!Incredible combination of flavors...great for snacking, cant wait to go back for more."
"Not your typical Korean BBQ, but the Kalbi tacos are fantastic!  I don't mind the blending of Korean and Mexican.  The other raters complaining about this detail are crazy.  Good food is good food!"
"Exceptional, affordable, consistent and FUN Korean-fusion! Been here or brought home maybe 12 times since opening, and every dish a flavor explosion. DELICIOUS. Only possible downside--and admittedly it's a stretch--is ambiance when dining in: fast turnover, loud, always crowded, sometimes tables need tidying...and furniture not the most comfortable in the world (the long bench is too low for the tables there). But make no mistake: this is a REMARKABLE joint."
"Oh Del Seoul.... what the hell would I do without you.  I love your pork, kalbi, shrimp, fish, and chicken taco.  Your kimchi fries?  My god the combination of french fries and kimichi frightened me but it is a like  match made in heaven.  Your bahn mi... ehh.... I had better but it will do.  I wish you would stay open later because this would be THE SPOT for hungry drunks.  I love you Del Seoul -- no other korean taco joint based in Chicago will ever replace you."
"Can I say how happy I am to have good Korean food within walking distance? Here is a list of all the things I love about this place: 1. the staff is super friendly 2. the food is delicious 3. the wait is never long4. the food is delicious 5. the dumplings are my new favorite thing ever They've only been open for a short time, but I think since then I've eaten here about 50 times. It's nice for me because I both live and work right down the street, but even if i had to take two trains and a bus, you'd find me sitting on the el, stuffing my face with street dumplings and gamja fries."
"This place is awesome! Extremely fresh ingredients and well-seasoned dishes. Also, very reasonably priced.Favorites:Binh-Ma Sandwich Chili-Shrimp Flavor - 5 starsChili-Shrimp Tacos - 5 starsBi-Bim-Bop is pretty good - 4 starsHighly recommended."
"I was nervous about what a shrimp taco might taste like, but WOW - I was blown away. In a city of amazing restaurants, I can honestly say that Del Seoul's shrimp tacos are one of my favorite dishes! I would highly recommend trying this little place - fast, easy takeout, and a small seating section."
"This place ROCKS!!!The shrimp Bahn-Mi is SOOOOOOOOO AMAZING.  I want to eat it every day for the rest of my life.I also tried the beef hot pot.  It was very good, but next time I am going to get a plate (it comes with more meat).  I will miss the crunchy hot pot rice though.The prices are SUCH a good deal.  It's seriously difficult to find places that still charge a reasonable price for a sufficient meal.  This place has won my heart and my wallet.Everyone should try."
"I went here a few weeks ago with some of my Korean friends who reccomended the place.  I went around 9 oclock and they close at 9:30.  When we arrived we were told we need to quickly order because they were done accepting orders.  Ok?  Strike one.  The guy taking our order seemed genuinely un-enthused and would have rather had us not come in.  This is pretty dissapointing.  I mean, if it was 5 minutes or so before close then I would understand.  Whatever.  All service blibs aside, the food was pretty good.  I had a Bulgogi Sandwhich and a few shrimp tacos.  Their shrimp was delicious, the Bulgogi was decent at best.  I will be back for the Kim-Chi/Pork Belly nachos but a third trip will be based on their customer service."
"Tasty food that is quick and easy with reasonable prices! It's a good choice whether you want just a snack, a light dinner/lunch, or a filling meal. We ordered the Bulgogi Banh Mi, a shrimp taco and the kim chi fries. The bulgogi and shrimp were slightly spicy, but nonetheless flavorful. I loved how the banh mi stuck to the Vietnamese style of adding pickled daikon and carrots and lots of cilantro, which goes really well with the meat. The kim chi fries were wonderful! I think they would be a good tactic to sneakily introduce people to kim chi.Overall, the place is no frills, but the menu is simple and fun. Unlike some fusion food that have too many flavors clashing at once, this place mixes korean in ways that complement each other really well...like kim chi (spicy + sour) and fries (salty + starchy)."
"Can't say enough good things about this place.Quick, easy, and cheap counter food, but not ""fast food"". The flavors! Oh, the flavors. I had the Kalbi taco, Shrimp taco and half of a  Chicken taco. I also tasted my friend's Pork taco. Across the board, very delicious. The shrimp was probably my favorite.The Kimchi is amazingly seasoned. These tacos burst with flavor.The Street Dumplings were also fantastic.We arrived on a Sunday at 11:50am (they open at noon) and was surprised to see a couple people waiting outside for them to open - by the time they opened the doors, there was already a line. So be prepared that there may not be tables available, but people move in and out quickly. I'll be back to try the pork belly fries."
"Yum! Korean tacos. The tacos are delicious with an unique flavor. The other korean dishes are terrific as well. They have expanded with plenty of seats now. Friendly staff, great place to eat!"
"This place is great!  I ate here with a couple of friends while visiting Chicago about a week and a half ago. It was only a few blocks from where I was staying, so we got our orders to go and brought it back to my friend's apt. It was just as well as there wasn't an empty seat in the place! Inside it kind of reminded me of a hipper chipotle. I ordered three tacos: the Kalbi, the shrimp and the chicken...They were all very tasty, but the Kalbi was by far my favorite. If I had to order again I would probably drop the chicken and try the pork. The cilantro-onion relish on the tacos was sooo delish. Regarding the tacos, I really didn't see the point in providing two tortillas for each taco, one was def enough (although this isn't a big issue, all you have to do is not eat the second tortilla). I was able to try my friend's Bulgogi banh mi, and it was probably the best thing any of us ordered. The steak was extremely juicy and tender, and for the price they provide a pretty big sandwich. My review of this place is really 4.5 stars, but there were two things that bumped it from 5 star status: I wasn't a fan of the pork belly fries...imo they were a bit cold and too soggy (could have had something to do with taking our order to go). The other (minor) issue was that there seemed to be a lot of confusion between the front and back of the house...I noticed three orders in a row (including mine) come out on plates instead of in a to go box. These things are very forgivable and I'd love to go back next time I'm in the area! Try the bulgogi banh mi, you won't regret it!"
"My default order is two tacos and split the kimchi fries.  A tON of food, but all are must haves.  Pork and beef tacos are my go-to's, but everything I've tried is good!"
"Wanted to check out this new modern Korean style restaurant for lunch. i read the previous reviews on how the shrimp taco was the best. I ordered a Kalbi taco, Shrimp taco, Spicy pork, and the kimchi fries. The fries themselves were definately not worth $7. Although as a Korean it was a new taste, but it definately was not satisifying.My co-worker got the Banh-mi sandwich which is why I rated this a 3 rather then a 2.5. He was satisfied with the sandwich, while I felt the tacos had way too much cabbage on top of the taco."
"Happy tummy!!! Kalbi tacos, pork tacos and kimchi fries :) Thanks for hitting the spot :) Love the new expansion and can't wait to get my DEL SEOUL fix again... my tummy is waiting patiently... anticipating the tasty treats!! : )"
"Great fushion. The Kimchi Porkbelly Fries were a little too greasy for my taste, but its delicious fries covered in cheese.Every taco is to try for especially the Kalbi taco."
Was pleasantly surprised that they had something a vegan could eat!  Got the stone bowl bibimbap without the egg and it was pretty good!  Not only did the guy that took my order know what a vegan was but he also told me it has gluten!  :)
"Let's get this out of the way... I love food. I'm not a foodie or a snob. I do not have a self described sophisticated palate. I just like to eat. Because of this reason I am head over heels for Del Seoul. Let's start with the tacos. I had one of each. The BBQ pork and chicken were virtually indistinguishable from each other, having the exact same texture and sauce. The pork was a little more tender so I will give it the nod. The panko crusted Shrimp taco was a great departure form the bbq and I loved the kick from the chili aoli. But my favorite taco by far was the Kalibi. You'll just have to try it.The Side items were great as well. I'll be back for sure for the Bim-Bop.The service was great and as for the small space, rumor has it they will be expanding next door and starting deliveries soon. Uh oh, that's trouble."
"So delicious.  It's a great, easy location to get to and the staff is really friendly.  I have always gotten their food to go, so my rating is based solely on that.  The tacos are definitely the best thing on the menu and very affordable, but I didn't like the bibimbop and thought it was less flavorful.  The fries with the fixins on top were pretty good too, but these tacos are to die for and a great hangover cure."
I like their bulgolgi and shrimp bahn mi
This place is EXCEPTIONALLY clean.  The servers are super friendly and eager to explain the menu.  This was my first time trying Korean tacos and the Banh Mi.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The Kimchi fries were good as well.  Pretty good spot!
Love this place! Korean style tacos? Hells yes! Anything here is incredible. I could go on forever about this place. SO GOOD!!
"I've never eaten any sort of Korean food, so this was a totally new experience for me!  I ordered the Spicy BBQ Chicken taco. It came with their signature 'Secret Slaw', salsa and cilantro-onion relish. I have to say it was one of the tastiest tacos I have ever eaten!  The taco really has a perfect balance of flavors, I could eat these on a regular basis. I am going to try out the shrimp one next time, as I have heard it is even tastier!  The Seoul Style Street dumplings are the perfect side to the tacos.  We also ordered the Kimchi fries, but I was definitely not a fan. They were borderline boring.... but on the verge of just being bad."
Not your traditional Korean food but they take standard Korean flavors and preparations and mix them with foods from other cultures like bahn mi's (Vietnamese) and tacos (Mexican) to create delicious offerings! Love stopping in for a quick sandwich/taco/dumplings/bibmbap whenever I am craving some sort of Korean food.
Best Korean food I have yet to have had. Still need to try a few things but so far I love the plates and the seasoned fries. The tacos are a good quick meal too. Just can't say I don't like about anything in have had.
"Del Seoul makes me happy. The food is consistently fantastic and the staff are wonderful and friendly. All of their food has an explosion of flavors... my favorites are the shrimp, short rib and chicken tacos. Kimichi fries are delicious as well. The prices are more than fair here..."
"I just moved to Chicago, and apparently this place is pretty new and popular. It is right around the corner from my house, and I'm glad it's there. I had the Spicy Beef Sandwich, which is a decent deal at $6. It was pretty tasty, didn't exactly blow my mind, but my taste buds were  pleased. It had a few jalapeño peppers in it that added a kick. There was some white strips...I think white radish maybe? They added good crunch and complemented the beef well. The service was very good, it was my first time there and the guy at the counter told me his honest opinion about what was good and what wasn't as good. He brought it out to me when it was ready and even cleared my basket as I sat there finishing my drink, which wasn't really necessary but nice of him. Cute girl working there as well...I hope she reads this...They have kimchi (sp?) in jars for sale for 3 dollars, which is cool if you like it. They also have some imported drinks and asian snacks, which is a nice touch. I'll definitely be a regular here!"
I've never tried Korean BBQ before.  I had the kalbi taco and an order of dumplings.  The taco was good but I thought it was a little small for the price.  The dumplings were delcious and a good value.  It would be nice to have a lunch menu or some kind of platter that allows you to try a couple of things at once.I'll go back for sure but don't have the urge to go in the next few days (I tend to do that with a place I love).
"The first time I went to Del Seoul, I loved it.  The second time I went, I decided that I probably wont be going back.  The galbi taco's are very good, but they use so much oil. I tried the porkbelly kimchee fries and thought they were amazing the first time, but the second time disappointed.  I think that my final review is that this place is somewhat of a novelty, and the taste isn't good enough to keep me as a loyal customer."
I'd fly back to Chicago for their tacos...their prices are good too.
"I have heard tons of good things about this place so the hubby and I were salivating at the thought of casual Korean food, but not at the astronomical sit-down-with-hot-plate-in-front-of-you-with-­giant-kalbi-bone prices.  (You even notice that? Damn Kalbi will cost you 20 bucks, but you get a big ass bone with some tendon on it?! AND YOU GOTTA COOK IT YOURSELF?!! PSSHHHH!!!) So we walk in, and this place is packed - its a small venue where you order up front and grab seating where its available - so if you got a buddy, make sure they save you your seats. We order the kalbi tacos - which were great - the kalbi was well-marinated and the chopped veggies perfectly complimented the flavor. We also order the kimchi fries, which were good, but didn't blow me away where I would return for them.  Then, as all plate-envy-ers do, we saw everyone with the dumplings.  I was resisting them at first, but when we saw everyone in the restaurant with them, I caved and bought them.  I should've trusted my instincts and just bought the bi-bim-bop instead. I'll definitely come back from the kalbi tacos, and i want to try their bulgugi next time.  All in all, good food and good value."
"Bulgogi Banh Mi sandwich, where have you been all of my life? Two of my favorite things combined into one. Even if I hated everything else on the menu, I would still give them 5 stars for this sandwich. It is so very satisfying. I've had their tacos about a year back, but when I make it out this way, I can't stray from the bulgogi. I wish they were in wicker park!"
"Even though I think the taco trucks in California is better, this place will do for Chicago.  I love the kimchi fries! It may seem like a weird combination, but it goes so well together! I get it everytime I'm there. The sandwiches are better than the tacos in my opinion. The bulgogi sandwich is my favorite! The sandwiches are more of a vietnamese style so there's lots of veggies in it.  The employees are friendly and the service is quick, however the place gets packed very quickly, so try to come during non rush hours."
"YES for the fish tacos, shrimp tacos & dolsot hot stone bi bim bab. All STELLAR!!The meat I had in the kalbi beef tacos was a bit chewy on occasion, so I don't order those anymore. But because of the other stellar options this place is one of my main go-to eateries in the city. Fantastic!!"
"I pride myself on my Korean food knowledge as I've been eating it for most of my life but sheesh, this fusion food is seriously hot right now and might I add, seriously AWESOME.   Note that this review is for ""carry out"" only.  The pickles were awesome, kimchi was tasty (comes in jar so I can save what I don't eat), veggie Bibimbap was good, not great - the bean paste had a different consistency then I'm used to but the tacos were really good.  As a vegetarian that sometimes acts as a pescatarian (aren't we annoying?), the shrimp tacos were great.  They were breaded shrimp with an ailoi that just worked.  Although there really wasn't anything Korean about them. My partner enjoyed the Kalbi, pork, and chicken tacos and complimented on the ""fusion"".  I will add that when I first walked in I noticed the front table filled with 5 koreans; always a good sign.   I also understand some of the reviews regarding the layout.  It was the same situation as urban belly without communal seating, just tables.  Basically a register towards the back, open kitchen, and a line that forms down the middle.  Perhaps this is part of the ""fusion"" - not fast food but not really meant to sit around and hang out either - more an eat and get out motto and I can't say that I mind it."
Pretty amazing Galbi tacos and chicken wings! There is the perfect balance of veggie to meat ration on the taco. The soy glaze on the chicken wing adds the perfect chew to the crispy wings! The shrimp taco and dumplings were okay-- something to try once.
Had the fries and 3 tacos and split a hot bowl with a friend. Everything was fresh with excellent flavor. The best quick-service food I have had in a long time! I'll definitely be trekking back up here soon.
"I totally agree with Jiyoun B's review.Don't expect full on Korean, don't even expect Mexican. Just expect something new and delicious! The tacos were really yummy. I also love that they sell Kimchi by the small jar. Korean market is way too far away so to eat Kimchi, I usually go to Crisp or Aloha. Now there is another place I could go! If you have any questions, feel free to ask the people at the counter. They are super friendly and helpful. I think the prices are perfect too. Korean food involves so much prepping, y'all have no idea! Only downside for me is the food just isn't spicy enough but that's understandable since they have to cater to people with a sensitive palette. I refuse to cover the delicious relish/slaw and meat with sriracha for heat!  Perhaps extra spicy could be an option? Also Dear, Del Seoul. Please start delivering!!!!!"
one of my favorite places!
"I've been here a couple times.  Things that I liked: Bibimbop, tacos and Street style dumplings.  Things I didn't like: fries.  I could probably eat the Bibimbop and dumplings every day for a long time.  I can't believe how good they taste.  Whenever I drive by, there is a long line to order.  I have to start thinking ahead and order for takeout."
"Good Korean tacos, especially the sesame-chili shrimp! I also tried the sambai fish and the spicy BBQ pork which were okay. The latter two lacked a kick but the slaw and sauces they used were both very tasty and unique! I was a little disappointed by the chicken wings which I thought were very sticky, too sweet and not crisp enough for my taste. That being said, I would definitely come back here just to order 5 shrimp tacos!"
"A very welcome addition to the taco serving restaurants in the area. Also much better than some of the ""standard"" taco places in the area. The tacos are very good if not a tad overloaded with the greens that come with the taco. They make for a somewhat messy taco to eat. I have really enjoyed the Kalbi, Spicy Pork and Spicy Chicken. The fries are excellent but are so big you will need to split them with a friend. The plates are also delicious. This place can get pretty busy so it might be hard to get a seat but it always seems to work out."
"When I lived in the area, I had to control myself from eating here more than once a week. I really love this place. Haven't been in a while since moving to a different neighborhood, and have actually only been once or twice since they expanded the store - which I'm glad they did! Seating was limited before, and the tacos were SO much better if eaten right away in the restaurant. The fish, shrimp, kalbi, and pork tacos are my favorite. aaand that's all the taco options with the exception of the chicken (which isn't bad, but the others are just so good.) Tried one of the plates or bowls once, and personally like the tacos more."
"This place could be awesome but it sometimes cuts corners on its meats.  Or I really wish that SOME fast or semi-fast food place would charge me MORE but give me good and consistent quality chicken/pork/beef.  Having said that, their spicy fish and shrimp tacos and sandwiches are always delish, because they can't be ruined with sub-par meats the way other items on the menu can.  I also like the miso soup (healthy stuff!) and fries, although I try not to overdo it with those since they are much less healthy :-)"
"My husband and I came here last fall after reading all the great reviews. We ordered kalbi tacos, bbq pork tacos, shrimp tacos and the pork belly fries. We ordered our food, and then we had to wait 25 minutes for a table. However, the food was really great, so it made waiting for the table less awful The bbq pork tacos were my favorite. The meat was really flavorful, and I really love the slaw they use in their tacos. The pork belly fries didn't really blow me away. They were tasty, but not as amazing as I imagined pork belly fries might be. Maybe if the chunks of pork belly were larger...I dunno. My husband loved the fries though, so maybe I was just being picky. The food is delicious here and if you've never had Korean tacos before, you need to try Del Seoul. Just remember that the restaurant is very small, so be prepared to wait if you want a table. Other than that, it's great! I hope they start serving Kimchi pizza. That would be a wonderful addition to the menu!"
"after hearing so many great things on yelp about del seoul, i suggested to my family that we go there for lunch & give it a try...and they were happy that i suggested it!!! del seoul is a great place for cheap & delicious KBBQ. we ordered a nice variety off the menu...the tacos remind me of the KBBQ tacos that you get from the kogi food truck in LA (except you don't have to wait over an hour in line at midnite for it). the tacos were savory & tangy with a lil kick of spice from the ""salsa""; we ordered the pork tacos, beef bulgogi & shrimp tacos...the shrimp tacos were a lil more spicy bc of the chiles they use.i went for the beef bulgogi banh mi & it was sooo tasty!! perfect combination of succulent bulgogi topped w/ fresh cucumbers, daikon & cilantro. we also ordered the gamja fries & kimchi fries. the kimchi fries were pretty good topped with cheese, pork belly, kimchi n the same dipping sauce that comes w the gamja fries. this place is kind of like crisp (bulgogi, bi bim bap except they have tacos & banh mi)..so if you like that place then you'll definitely like del seoul!! i'm thinking i'll probably even come back here later this week..i wanna try the dumplings too. =P"
"okay, so i have to admit...i'm not a huge fan of Korean food, but my husband is Korean and we heard about this place and had to try it.  i was anxious about what i could order here, and i came out with a full and happy stomach.i had kalbi tacos.  the kalbi was cooked perfectly and extremely tasty.  we also had the kimchi fries and gamja fries, which were delicious.  my husband tried a variety of things and was extremely pleased.i give it 4 stars only cuz it took us a while to find parking (which we expected in this busy area) and we weren't sure if we could get a table (thankfully one opened up not too long after we ordered).we'll definitely be frequenting this spot...and i'm looking forward to trying more things on the menu...something i didn't think i would be open to before coming here. it's definitely great food!"
Swung by but had to settle for carryout cause they were too busy. The kalbi taco was amazing. The pork dumplings were really good too. All that and a coke was $10.50(little pricey). But I gotta go back for those kimchee fries.
"Four stars, but the price factors in.  It's cheap - with a couple $3 tacos and a $1.75 side of fries you can be full of yummy K-BBQ!  The kimchi fries are great, but not if you're on a budget or watching your waistline.  I still need to try the dumplings and bibimbop..."
I stand corrected. Go get their shrimp tacos.  You'll thank me later.
"This place is da BOMB!  I have eaten korean tacos all over California and the few places in Chicago.  This place has the best kalbi tacos I've had.  The flavor is spot on, the toppings are complimentary without taking over the show, and I could eat 5 of these in one sitting (cuz I'm a fatass).You have to try the kimchi fries if you're open to a little spicy and something different.  Think Korean chili while you eat these.The bahn mi sandwiches are excellent as well.  Excellent bread and toppings.  Nice spin on a vietnamese sandwich.Highly recommended."
"Del Seoul has great Banh Mi sandwiches. I need to branch out more seeing as the sandwiches are so delicious. I really enjoy the spicy pork and it does have a kick to it! Seeing all the great reviews on the tacos, that will be next adventure."
"I stopped by Del Seoul early Saturday evening, so early that I had a small table all to myself with no line or struggle. I wanted to try a couple of the Korean tacos (Korea-Mex?). Admittedly when the two tacos were brought out to me, I was disappointed that they were so small. The ingredients were very fresh-tasting, and the spicy BBQ pork taco was barely hotter than the sweeter kalbi beef taco. The slaw on top added crispness, not unlike the slaw atop Salvadorean pupusas. OK I was still hungry, so I then ordered a bulgogi banh mi sandwich (Korea-Viet?). Now that's more like it! The sandwich was slightly overstuffed in a toasted French bread roll, with tangy beef bulgogi meat topped with thin daikon and carrot strips and a bit of neutral-tasting red pepper aioli sauce. I enjoyed the hip music selection, and the fact that about 80% of the clients during my dining experience were Asian (I was probably the oldest and least hip Asian in the room). Del Seoul is a good concept, and I shall return."
Pretty much perfect.  I wish they had a BBQ chicken plate other than just getting the kid size.  What a great place for takeout.
I came with a muffin top for a stomach and left with a cake explosion.
"Very original Lincoln Park gem.  It's an unassuming little place without much fanfare, but oh my, the food is delicious.  If you like Korean food, you'll love the fusion of flavors here; if you've never tried Korean, you owe to yourself to start.  The tacos are out of this world.  Remember that scene in Ratatouille when the food critic tastes the peasant meal and is immediately transported back to his childhood? This food will make you feel like that even though you never tasted this when you were a kid."
"Had a BBQ Pork sandwich and some fries today for lunch from Del Seoul.  I loved it!  Located in a little space on Clark, this place is a nice, fast food, contemporary Korean BBQ.  The flavors of the sandwich were perfect, with the meat well seasoned, a nice slaw of sorts and fresh jalapeños to top it off.  The fries were typical, but served with an interesting garlic, onion, sesame mayo.  The service is friendly and quick while the environment is clean and nice, but not necessarily a comfortable space to hang out in for a while.  Sandwiches are affordable and are large enough to not require a side."
"Best Korean tacos  in Chicago hands down!  I love stopping by here for their tacos.  Everyone I've brought here has loved it.  The shrimp sandwiches are amazing.  If you love good fusion food, stop by here."
When this place first opened (only half the size it is today) it was a much better quality of food.  It seems as though they have either changed their cooking staff or where they purchase their ingredients.  I would say this place was 5 stars when it first opened.  Went back last week and the food was far less impressive.  May be the only option for Bulgogi tacos though.
"Fusion done right - how refreshing. No stretching or faking. Just making sure that the flavors work well together and the food actually taste good! I had 2 tacos - kalbi and spicy pork. Both were extremely well-executed - flavorful, perfectly cooked meat. Plus, enough if a kick in the kimchi to keep your attention but not blow your head off. Great addition to the neighborhood."
"Del Seoul...you knocked me right off my feet! With consistent traffic flowing and a line almost out the front door, this Lincoln Park spot is sure to be a staple if this keeps up!Bibimbop, Korean BBQ tacos, Banh Mi (Viet sandwiches, but here w a Korean spin), and sides such as fries and dumplings are currently available.Being a first timer, I went all in! I sampled the kalbi taco, the pork taco, and the shrimp taco...as well as the pork belly fries! My least favorite of the 3, probably the kalbi. Dont get me wrong, it tastes great, but out of the 3 its my least favorite. Next up, the pork taco! This one comes pretty close to the shrimp in terms of flavor, but the shrimp edges it out. And last, the shrimp taco. Panko breaded w a chili aioli, the shrimp has the best flavor out of these 3 tacos. although you only get 2 shrimp (in mine, they were actually quite large) its plenty for your enjoyment. I didnt try the chicken, but the lady at the register recommended the chicken and pork as 2 of the most popular. Kimchi and pork belly fries....ugh. wow. Definitely a must try, recommend splitting w at least 2 people. I surprisingly did not drizzle any sriracha on the fries (i put the stuff on almost everything lol) but it didnt need it. Gooey cheesiness on perfectly crisp fries and kimchi...quite the combination!The menu is still expanding and prices are changing, so be on the lookout for new things to come. No fountain drinks, but there is a large selection of drinks in the fridge to choose from. Cash and charge are accepted, if going w a large group try and get a table early on bc seating is fairly small.10.24.2010I had the chicken taco today...wow that is a super tasty treat! Id recommend the chicken and shrimp as first tries, kalbi and pork can wait!"
"Oh how I miss this place. Before moving away from Chicago, I made it a point to eat here repeatedly, since I figured I wouldn't be getting many Korean tacos in Texas.My god this place is great. Seriously. I've never tried something I didn't like. The slaw on these tacos is amazing. In fact, if I close my eyes, I can taste it. And it makes me cry. Why, dear sweet roly poly Jebus, did I leave Chicago?!?My favorites are all of the tacos, but my absolute favorites are the shrimp and fish. The gamja fries are really nice, as are the pickles and kimchi. Basically, everything here rules except for the horrible parking situation. Stop wasting time and go there NOW (preferably on foot or by CTA)."
"The Korean tacos are very flavorful.  I believe they are the specialty of Del Seoul.I enjoyed the food, even though most people think the tacos are a bit expensive.The sandwiches were also good.  Vietnamese sandwiches that are made slightly different but the meat was fresh and tasty.I also tried their short rib meal and it was good.A good place to try if you are in the area and can get a parking space."
"I read some article about this trend in places like California called Korean-Mex, and then all of a sudden this placed popped up all over yelp.  I'm not sure what this place is going for- they've got tacos, it's Korean, it's Vietnamese, who knows.  And, it's so freaking hyped up that I had to assume it would suck.  But no. it did not at all.  I'm not sure if they came up with the idea of putting bulgogi in a banh mi, but it's really freaking good.  The kalbi (short rib) taco was also pretty awesome.  And you know what's also fabulous?  the prices, especially given it's location and how trendy and popular this place is."
"Had dinner at Del Seoul on New Year's Eve. Been here many times and my sister has been up twice from Atlanta and we go. Can't say enough good things about this place. I always get the fries with the garlic aioli, 2 shrimp tacos and a kalbi beef taco and a side of kimchee.I live far from this place and I would like them to come up with a way for me to take this food home and then put it together when I get home. Or even to have it for the next day.  I love this place and now will be taking a friend for her birthday. I know she will love it too.*~*~*~How about coming to the northern suburbs????"
"I'll first start off by saying that my ethnicity is Korean so I have tried numerous types of Korean food and I understand they try to infuse the Korean and American taste here. After several visits, I'd say you should really go with their Galbi or Galbi/shrimp tacos that have fresh greens. There bibim bahp is prepared fresh and the kimchi fries is a good and unique taste. I've had better spicy tofu stew but it's something that you can definitely try if your familiar with this dish. This place is a ""order at the counter they'll bring out to your table"" place and there pretty good at explaining a dish if you aren't familiar. I'll definitely be going back for the tacos."
"I never get tired of Del Seoul, usually my obsessions wear off after a few months, but I'm still uber obsessed with this place.  My Favs are still the tacos - shrimp & pork! They've got a good thing going!"
"Good, reasonably priced restaurant that is a little different from the rest.  Korean fusion tacos are a very trendy option right now and this place has those together with kimchi fries.  I have never got around to these because I have never got past ordering my favorites.  I love the Kalbi plate and the hot stone Bibimbop.  Both options give you a mix of meat, vegis and rice.  You also get a side of kimchi.  Don't worry if you have never eaten Korean food before, as the menu is posted above the counter with full descriptions.  You order at the counter and are given a number to post at your table and the food is brought out to you. Be sure to order a side of Market Piklz which is a fresh cucumber pickle and very tasty.The restaurant is bright and clean and leans more to a fast food decor than a sit down restaurant decor.  Service is fast even though the food is cooked to order and is always hot and fresh.  If you arrive at about 7 - 7.30 in the evening  there will probably be a long line at the counter, but don't worry as it moves very fast.I have seen some snotty remarks from foodies about the authenticity of this restaurant, for example that it isn't ""real"" Korean.  All I can say is it is successful enough to have doubled it's space since it first opened and there is a constant stream of asian customers."
"One of my favorite go to spots!! Before the remodel I would have only given it 4 stars because of lack of seating. Now with extra seating and an even bigger menu, I'm in love even more. Kobe beef tacos and the garlic aoli sauce are my favorite. My boyfriend loves the steak plate. If you live close, stop in. It'll be worth your while,promise."
Good take out food.  Blend of Korean and Mexican flavors. Reminds me of Belly Shack over on Western Ave.
"Mmm... Korean and Mexican fusion... who woulda thunk. Pretty delicious Korean-marinated meats in tacos happen to actually work. The dumplings are good, and the fries with sesame garlic aeoli sauce were decent, except I think my sauce had a piece of green onion that had gone bad. : / Otherwise, delicious food, and quite cheap. I will definitely be checking this place out more."
If you are in the area and want to check it out go for it.  Nothing to write home about.  Food got cold really fast.  We left most of it and went to eat somewhere else after.  Counter person does expect to be tipped for putting your order in a computer like Wendy's does.
"I've been there once so far - I tried every taco they had - its delicious, Cant wait to try everything else."
Tacos and sandwiches are fresh and delicious. The service is always on point no matter how busy they are.  They don't mess up big orders. I love Del Seoul.
"A friend told me about this place so I decided to try it since neither of us had a korean taco before. The food was really good. I had a Kalbi taco which was good but the Spicy BBQ Pork taco is money. imo, of the two it's the best. The cashier was nice and friendly and the food came out in like two minutes but i only did order two things. I didn't eat there but it look nice and clean. The parking was kind of a hassle but it's expected of that area"
"Walked in, talked to the Pete, the owner, about the various dishes on the menu. Although I struggle with trying new things, he talked me into the shrimp tacos, kimchi, and gave me a taste of a new item they are working on. The shrimp tacos were a nice blemd of creamy spicy crunchy. Loved the texture of the greens with the crispy shrimp and the chewy tortilla. The kimchi was great, first time trying, with a mild burn and cabbagey flavor, would make a great relish. This new crab pancake had a lot of flavor with jalepenos, pollock and scallions. Mostly like a korean fusion omlette. Just enough onion with heat and flavor from chillis and crab. Hope this is on the menu when I return.Will stop here again. Love the personalized service, and the cashier was a looker too. :)"
"They might not be served off a food truck like on the West coast, but Korean tacos have officially hit Chicago and I'm happier for it.  I usually go for the kalbi or spicy pork tacos.  The meats are always well marinated and the entire taco gets rounded out with their tasty cilantro-onion relish and ""secret slaw"" that both cools and gives a touch of heat.  Even with the budget friendly pricing, they never skimp on the taco fillings either.  3 tacos is just about right for my appetite and the steamed dumplings make for a light and tasty appetizer as well.  I'm curious to see what happens when the food truck ordinance changes in this town, but until then I'm perfectly content with a short trip to Lincoln Park to get my Korean taco fix."
"meh. maybe it's because i'm korean, but I really wasn't that wow-ed. i had a measly shrimp taco and a decent bbq pork taco. My friend had the bbq pork bahn mi and said it was decent.I was ready to try the best, as Del Seoul had so much rave before opening! Maybe I need to make another go at it but, I wasn't super impressed. Was I supposed to be?I am sad, however, that I didn't order the kimchi-pork belly fries!"
"I have been here 5 times in the past month.  The Korean tacos here are incredible.  I first came here with my girlfriend and she liked it so much we were back 3 times that week.  I think they put crack in their tacos.  Meanwhile I told my friend Tom and my other buddy Mike who's mom is from Korea and he said the Bulgogi and Kalbi are right on and they both said the Shrimp Taco is the best taco they ever had.  This is more of a fast food dining experience and I am not saying that in a negative connotation.  You order at the front counter and they give you a number.  You go ahead and sit down and then they bring your food to the table for you.  The employees are super friendly and the one girl that took our order the first time remembered us from the last time we visited.  Very personable.  Takes about 5-10 minutes to be served once you order.  In the 5 times that I have been here it has not been too crowded.  About half to 3/4 full.  FYI - Parking can be a little tricky to find around here depending on what time of day you visit.  Also, it is always chilly in here for some reason so I would wear something warm underneath your jacket.  I hate eating with my coat on.I have had quite a few items on this menu but I will just review the tacos I have had because they really are the highlight of the menu.1.)  Shrimp Taco:  Hands down the best thing on the menu.  This is a soft corn tortilla filled with Crunchy Panko Shrimp, secret slaw, cilantro-onion relish, chili aoli (which really makes the taco), and sesame seeds.  The texture is crunchy from the shrimp, fresh and crispy from the slaw, nutty from the sesame seeds and sweet, salty, savory, and vinegary all at the same time.  It is like an Asian Food Bomb exploded in your mouth.  Guarantee you will love this unless you don't like or are deathly allergic to seafood.2.)  Kalbi Beef Taco:  This is the second taco I have tried thus far on the menu.  If you haven't had Kalbi or Galbi before, it is a sweet and salty marinated Korean bbq short rib similar to a terriayaki flavoring.  This taco includes a corn tortilla with a generous portion of Kalbi beef and all of the same toppings as the Shrimp Taco minus the aoli.  The quality of the meat is tender, juicy and a little fatty in a good way.  If you like beef and enjoy Asian flavors you will love this taco.3.)  Fish Taco:  I have had this taco 3 different times.  The first time I had it I loved it and thought it was the best tasting taco here but the second and third time I had it I found it a little too salty.  I understand salt is a prominent flavor in a lot of Korean dishes but at some point there is a limit.  In trying to find what it was I dissected the taco, tried each part of the taco separately and found that the batter was the culprit.  I think if they cut back on the salt in the batter this would be my favorite.  This taco comes with a flour shell (instead of the corn which you will find with the other tacos) and is filled with a rather large single portion of deep fried haddock which was really light and flaky.   It is then topped with pickled red onion, Napa Slaw, and a Sambal Sauce( a red chili sauce).  So you get nice crunch from the batter, with a creamy and crunchy taste from the toppings and a spicy shot from the Sambal.  If you don't mind the saltiness this may be your favorite.4.)  Chicken Taco:  Very similar flavors as the Kalbi but not as delicious because it is chicken not beef.  Kind of a similar comparison as a traditional chicken taco to a steak taco.  You get the chicken because you think it is better for you.  You know what, you are eating tacos, go all out.I haven't had the pork yet but I think I will substitute it next time for the fish. Summary:Some of the best tacos you will ever have, very affordable prices for a fast lunch or dinner and friendly service.  I highly recommend this spot.  It has come to be one of our favorites.  FYI - The Kalbi dinner and dumplings are also very good."
"I really don't see what the big stink is about this place?!?  I have tried many different dishes there because so many people swear by this place so I kept thinking I was ordering the wrong dish.  It's not that anything was terrible, or of bad quality it is more that nothing really knocked my socks off.  Maybe it's more of a ""me"" thing and this just  isn't my type of food.  To be fair, the place is always busy, it's clean, the staff is friendly...I personally just don't care for the actual food."
Kalbi.  Tacos.  Need I say more?  Love this place.  Super casual- Korean taco stand style.  Service is great too!
"Korean taste in tortillas!! No other restaurant in Chicago does it like Del Seoul. I went on a Friday night before it closes and the ambiance was lively and fun. My fav taco was the shrimp one. The french fries with some ""seafood onions taste"" was delicieux too!!"
"I went here on a whim and was impressed by the fare that was offered. Korean-Mexican fusion sounds like a disaster but the bibimbob sandwich that I had was a nice collection of different flavors, though the bread was a little dry for my taste with a steak style sandwich. The pickled vegetables on the bun were a nice touch though. The fries tasted a lot like, well fries, and were nothing special, the sauce that came with them tasted a bit bland for korean or mexican cuisine. My biggest disappointment with the restaurant was the lack of Asian-Mexican spices in the food as Asian Chiles and Central American Chiles have a nice wet-hot spice combination. I would suggest trying the tacos though as I hear they are delectable."
"I was really looking forward to this place after reading all the reviews.  Del Sol's a nice place for reliably good food, but I wouldn't say it's out of this world.  After having some ridiculously good mexican/korean fusion food in San Francisco, my husband and I had some high hopes for Del Sol.  I should have stuck to my usual mantra of having low expectations so I wouldn't be disappointed.  If this had been the first time I had kor-mex food, I think I would have felt differently.My husband and I ordered the Kimchi fries and one each of all the taco varieties.  Our fries were way to cheesy and grease laden and the kimchi lacked the sour component.  It was basically cheese fries with a little kimchi.  The shrimp, fish, and the bulgogi tacos were the best of the bunch.  I do not recommend the pork taco.  It was way chewy, dry, and lacked flavor."
"Yeah, this place is amazing and I am in love with it. I get intense cravings for their kalbi tacos and can't resist. Fish tacos are great too."
AWESOME!  Liked it better than when I visited LA a few years ago to try the popular kogi taco trucks.  The place is small - minimal tables and seating.  Turnover is decent.  Menus on 3 flat screen TVs.I loved everything I had:Kalbi tacoPork tacoKim Chi Fries (ingredient list on the menu also included big happy face)  :)Fiance liked the SHRIMP taco the best.Decent pricing.  Will be sad if prices go up.Watch your step going in and out!  I am totally going back again and again!  This is something I will have cravings for.  :)  Yum!
Great Korean Street Food Fusion and Kimchi.  Bulgoi and Bibimbop are great too ask for extra sauce on the later.
"Great quality at an unbelievable price.  This was my first time having Korean BBQ, but I became a big fan at first bite.  We started off with Market Piklz which to my delight were not too spicy, but successfully fulfilled my boyfriend's salt addiction.  I enjoyed the Spicy Pork Sandwich & he had a collection of tacos (steak, pork & chicken).  We both loved our lunches & will definitely be back."
"The kalbi beef and the spicy pork tacos were sooooo good, a must try"
"This place is so over rated and over hyped honestly. I went her and got the kalbi taco and the shrimp sandwich viet sandwich. Seriously all the ""taco"" is just kalbi with mexican toppings, which i might add they add to much on top. I mean it was good but I could have just made that at home. The kalbi tasted just like any other kalbi. The sandwich was good I liked how the jalapenos were chopped really thin and looked pretty. It was a pretty good sandwich the shrimp was a bit chewy and it needed more shrimp in the sandwich. The staff was nice and the decor was cute I loved the Asian chips and pop I tried all of them pretty good I loved the grape one. I mean I think the place is nice but how you people are raving about it is a bit over the top. I mean its good but not WOW OMG  good."
"Eh, their tacos are good, but nothing special and a bit over priced considering you can get much better tacos from a myriad of different places not too far away for cheaper. Hot pots are hit or miss and their kim chi is most certainly a HUGE miss. Overall, not bad, but also not worth going back."
"Went here the first week it opened several months back and was pretty excited about the menu items featured, but poor execution can bring down any dish(es). Ordered all four variations of the tacos, while the ingredients were very fresh and tasted well all the extra toppings on the tacos dampened a lot of the flavors. More specifically the flavors of each taco type seemed to taste a bit too similar, possibly could benefit from reducing the number of toppings to help focus the flavor fully on the meat. The Kimichi fries while made to a good crisp and taste seemed to not absorb the flavor of the toppings placed on the fries. Leaving a lot of the kimchi and melted cheese that would slide off the fries to be eaten separately.  Lastly, the Seoul style dumplings had good flavor and texture, but compared to various pan-asian restaurants I've eaten in the burbs and the city it would hardly stand out as a fan favorite or being truly distinct from the rest.In the end this was the first week they opened so I do expect them to have polished a lot of their dishes since my visit and do plan on revising this review based on my next visit, which I do look forward to."
I was so happy when this place opened up! The steamed dumplings are delicious and so filling--I would recommend sharing as an appetizer. The shrimp taco is incredible. The flavors are like nothing I have ever tried before. Great location and nothing like this food in the area. Definitely worth a try!
The tacos are out of this world good! Just a refreshing change from your typical taco. The sandwiches are great too but man I could eat those tacos all day!
"I went to this place on Saturday afternoon with a group of friends. The place was busy, but not too noisy. The crowd was diverse. There were few families, few couples, and few huge groups of friends. It is definitely a good relaxing place that has super delicious food. For appetizers we ordered Seasoned Gamja Fries, which we all loved, especially Garlic-Sesame Aioli that comes with the fries. As a recommendation from a friend who ate here before, I ordered Steak Hot stone Bowl Bibimbob. The way they make this dish is pretty cool! They place rice in a hot bowl, so that the rice at the bottom is crunchy. Never had rice like this before, and I have to admit -- I Loved it! Also, the dish is not that spicy and comes with the spice on the side for your taste to add. My fiend had shrimp tacos, and he claims that they were very, very delicious. I guess, I will have to go back and try it for myself! :)"
all you need to know is there shrimp tacos are the bomb
"I was definitely skeptical, but ended up loving it here. The kalbi tacos are amazing, they were huge so I actually split one taco to make 2 tacos. The kimchi fries are yummy! The service was super friendly, and the dining experience was fun and lively. I would recommend it for anyone that wants to try Korean food with an Americanized twist, good for a quick bite."
"Friendly staff, good location and quick service. The food is delicious and very filling. You have to try the steamed dumplings."
"this place is just ok.  went with a friend and we tried all the tacos, dumplings, and a bahn mi sandwich, and to tell you the truth, i've had better...of everything...many times over.  the meat is all very fatty...no lean cuts of anything except for maybe the beef, which was the only thing that didn't have a half-inch of clear fat rimming the edges. the shrimp taco is the best of all - but they are fried - would be so much better if they were grilled. too much slaw on the tacos.  the kimchi and bee-bim-bop looked delicious, i wish i had ordered them to-go instead of all the other stuff i had.   i will say that the staff was very nice and the service very speedy.  hopefully, they will expand their menu to include more variety and leaner cuts of meat.  oh yeah, the dumplings are awful. don't believe the hype."
"I have no clue how long Del Seoul advertised ""coming soon"" in it's storefront, but I do know that once I finally noticed it, I couldn't wait for it to open. To taunt me further I had a clear view of it's awning from my window. Shame I moved shortly after I tried it so it's no longer a quick 5 minute walk.Was finally able to check the place out days after it officially opened. My boyfriend and I ordered one of each taco, the bulgogi banh mi and a ""big jar o'kimchi"". We split the tacos up among the 8 tortillas so both of us could have one of each--all were delicious. As much of a carnivore as I am, the sesame-chili shrimp taco was my favorite and seemed to have the most flavor. Everything tasted so fresh and it was food you can feel good about eating (well, the tacos anyway, the kimchi & pork belly fries are probably a different story). The banh mi looked so delicious, but I couldn't even manage a single bite. My boyfriend loved it, though--so much so he managed to eat the remaining half after claiming he was too full. The kimchi was great and at $3 for an entire jar, it's a good deal considering I'm used to spending almost that much for a tiny side dish size container at a place just down the street.If you're looking for straight up Korean or Mexican, go elsewhere. If you want good fresh food with a twist, check this place out. It's a unique addition to the area and considering where it's at and the quality of the food, I think the prices are very reasonable."
"So once a year my friend and I go on a ""food crawl"" for an afternoon.   Of all the places we stopped, this was the highlight.  We both ordered the kalbi tacos and the dumplings.  The kalbi tacos were amazing, loved the combination of the short rib with the slaw and the corn tortilla set it off really well.  The dumplings were very flavorful but I didn't care for the gummy texture. I also ordered a couple of bulgogi banh mi's to go, and I'm SO glad I did.  This place should not be missed."
"I came here with the intention of trying the Korean tacos as everyone raves about them and I love tacos in any form or fashion.  Well, I got there, saw the menu and decided to try the bibimbop because I didn't like some of the things they put on the tacos and it said they don't like to make special orders.  Fair enough. I totally understand the premise behind that, but it still kinda sucks. Anyhow, I got the bibimbop with steak and the hot bowl thing.  It was darn tasty and was more than enough for two meals. It was my first time having Korean food, so I don't have much to compare it to. But it was good and the employees were helpful in explaining the menu, even though it was very busy.  It's a tiny restaurant, so it's probably not ideal for groups.  But definitely a place worth trying if you happen to be in Lincoln Park and want something different."
"Everything was so good.  We couldn't stop eating.  Tacos, dumplings, a sandwich and the bibimbap.  Best cheap meal I've had in Chicago thus far.  If it was closer, I might eat there everyday!"
It looks like they recently doubled the size of their dining room.  The food was wonderful.  Great place for Korean BBQ in Chicago.  I'll definitely be going back.
Yummy yummy.  Tacos and kimchi didn't disapoint!  I can't wait to return and try the dumplings.
Down the block from Molly's and Aloha Grill.  I would say try it for it's differenceness but it did not blow me away by any means. The best taco was the shrimp.  The kim-chi fries were good too but need to be eaten quickly or else they congeal and it's hard to mix up to spread the flavah.  They also sell fun korean drinks.
"Kimchi fries are really good and i love the tacos, bulgogi being my favorite. I think they thing that i really appreciate about Del Seoul is that you can tell they're making efforts to expand and continually improve their food."
"Nom nom nom! Lots of buildup and anticipation for Del Seoul but the good news is that it's delicious and makes a great addition to the neighborhood. I tried the kalbi and bbq pork tacos (preferred the pork), the pork dumplings and the seasoned fries. Going to try banh mi next time! And the pickles, which are hilariously spelled as ""piklz."" AND might take home a jar of homemade kimchi for only $3. Go check this place out! Yummy options for both meals and snacks."
"The tacos were fantastic, they have a lot of flavor. I tried the shrimp and the beef tacos. They are great! The fries are good but extremely heavy and a bit pricey. I liked them but would not order them again.The bimbimbap was alright, but nothing too special. I ordered it in the stone bowl for authenticity. Prices are reasonable, but just order the tacos and you'll be good and happy."
"KIMCHI FRIES are a must have! The tacos here are also very good. The Sesame-Chilli shrimp, kalbi and spicy BBQ pork are top choice tacos. If you are looking for burritos, go down the street to Crisp for the bugolgi burrito. mmmmMMMM YUM. If sandwiches are what you're looking for, I'd go to Bale in uptown instead. Cheaper and way tasty. Come here for the kimchi fries and tacos."
Del-icious!
"I just simply don't understand the big hubbub behind the ""korean taco"" craze.  I've had KOGI back in west coast and I honestly thought it was not worth the wait for what it is; basically, your korean bbq meat on a frigging tortilla with some korean condiments!  I made that all the time with my family bbq leftover.  Now, it was brilliant of chef Roy Choi to market his product smartly and start the food truck craze.  But honestly, I've had better korean bbq meat in so many different locations and to call Del Seoul spectacular would be lying.I tried the beef and the pork taco; the taco was overstuffed with spicy lettuce hybrid that many korean bbq restaurants serve.  The meat was ok looking and it smelled fine.  Taste wise, it was not as spicy as I thought it should be for a spicy korean pork and the marinated bbq rib was decent in its flavor as well.  I'll come back here occasionally when I get that korean bbq craving I need to fix in a hurry."
"pretty much agree with reviews below.   Got the shrimp and the kalbi tacos.  Both were delicious.  Shimp taco came with 2 fried shrimp.. i think 3 shrimps would have been the perfect amount.  Also got the reg fries with garlic dip, also pretty good, will try the pork fat fries next time!  we also got the street dumplings...which i will disagree with reviews before me.  It was good, but not great.  Just your regular dumplings, nothing special you cant get from a different place or even a frozen bag.all in all, good place, good price, minus the small seating area.  My friends and I (5 total) went on a wed night 7pm and seating was not a big problem.     Also agree with the tap water, which they keep behind the counter and give u tiny cups.  hrmmmm  bring a water bottle if you don't want to buy and overpriced one there.  It's ok to be asian sometimes, you're going to an asian restaurant anyways =)"
"Not bad.  After the glowing review I read in a student newspaper I thought it would be better, but still not bad.  The tacos (I had one with BBQ and one with shrimp) were tasty, but not very hot, as in temperature.  Fries were good, but I think they were pre-cut.  Well seasoned and served with an aioli that was really good.  There's some tables to sit at.  Too bad the sidewalk probably isn't wide enough for outdoor tables in the summer.  The other thing is parking totally sucks around there, but it is Lincoln Park/DePaul.  I'll go back and try something else, but I'd rather stick with Aranda's tacos in Montgomery or even Taco Movil in Aurora."
"ohhh, youve gotta try this place!yummy sandwiches, tacos, and fries, oh my!its the midwest version of a westcoast taco truck, but better!and although its a tiny little joint, you dont need much room to enjoy some good eats..*shrimp tacos and garlic gamja fries are a must!you wont be disappointed! :)"
Had a spicy shrimp bahn mi ...it was great
"Del Seoul...Del-ish.A-MAZING food.  Great value.  Friendly service.  Spectacular flavo(u)r.As a big fan of Crisp on Broadway, I've been very much looking forward to the opening of Del Seoul. I finally made it for my first time today and I was blown away.  My Bibimbop bowl was incredible, which I think is hard to do in the ""to-go"" fashion in which I ordered.  As per the recommendation of the girl behind the counter, I followed that up with a Spicy BBQ Pork taco and was...well...speechless.I've never tasted so much flavo(u)r in a single bite.  The spice was right on as was the BBQ flavor.  And if you're going to over stuff my taco so I have to finish the remnants with a fork or chopsticks, well, I'm not going to complain.  At all.Incredible.  Bowl and a taco for $11 and was full for some time (coming from the man who needs 3-4 slices of pizza to hold himself over from lunch to dinner).Can't wait to try more!(Probably tomorrow.)"
"I loved everything on their menu, espcially the pork banh mi. Also I personally liked the kimchi fries; all the melted cheese, fried kimchi, and fries."
Sooooooo good! I've been here a couple times with my bf and we always tend to get the tacos. Our faves are the shrimp and the kalbi tacos. The fries are super good too. Now that they have expanded I'm not worried of not getting a table now.
"When I heard about this place I was so excited to try it! I first heard of the kalbi taco concept in NYC, but never had the opportunity to try it (foodtrucks that are all the rage now, are just springing up in Chicago).The restaurant is not very large but we were able to find a seat relatively quickly (a lot of people seem to takeout instead of dine in).  After ordering, we received our food in less than 10 minutes, which was a plus because I was starving!  I decided to get the Kalbi Taco and the Kimchi and Pork Belly Fries. My boyfriend got the Spicy BBQ Pork Tacos and the Seasoned Gamja Fries. Reviews below:Kalbi Taco - Amazing! I am pretty picky about kalbi but the kalbi in these tacos had a very tasty marinade and the beef itself was very tender and juicy/good quality.  The greens on top with the sprinkling of sesame really pulled all of the flavors together and gave a nice texture and balance to the meat.  The tortillas were warm and tasty!  The size of the taco is pretty consistent with street tacos you'd find anywhere and I think the $2.50 price tag is pretty reasonable.Spicy BBQ Pork - I only had a bite of this but the pork was pretty good.  The spiciness gave it a kick that the kalbi didn't have but the rest of the taco was the same as the Kalbi (boyfriend who had a taste of both preferred the bbq pork).Kimchi and Pork Belly Fries-  I was extremely disappointed in this dish.  I perused the menu at work prior to going to the restaurant, and I was most excited about this.   I mean...Kimchi? Pork Belly? It couldn't get any better than that, in my opinion.  The fries were your standard fare, medium cut and crispy but nothing special.  The kimchi was okay, not very flavorful.  I would say the quality was worse than what you would find in a bottle at H-Mart.  If the kimchi was a bit spicier, I think it would have been an improvement.  The pork belly was the biggest letdown! I wasn't expecting a ton but I really had to scour through the fries with a fork to even find a piece.  It was cut into teeny tiny pieces (1cm X 1cm) and there were maybe 6 pieces in total (NOT an exaggeration!).  Considering they are charging $6.95 for these fries, this dish was not worth it at all.Seasoned Gamja Fries-  I really did not taste the seasoning at all.  They were the same fries as mine, without any of the toppings.  The garlic-sesame aioli came on the side for dipping and was decent (didn't really taste the sesame though.  For $1.75 this is not a bad side to order if you just want something extra.Overall, this place was pretty good.  You get gourmet korean food for street food prices.  I will definitely be returning to try the Banh Mi Sandwiches, the Bibimbop and the Dumplings!"
"del seoul lives up the hype.  the tacos (all flavors) and dumplings are fantabulous.  great flavors/textures and they actually reheat very well.  the right amount of spice too - not burny, flavory.  i would like to return to try the bahn mi and fries!disclaimer:  DO NOT buy the shrimp flavored snacks.  just don't do it, you will thank me."
"Really excellent food for a great value in Lincoln Park. Kalbi and spicy chicken are must-haves. The pickles are very tasty, I just wish they sold them in bigger containers!"
"I'm not ashamed to say it, I get korean dumpling cravings. And this is the place I go to get my fix. The tacos are fine, and the bibimbop is just too sacred to get anywhere but down the street at Crisp. So did I mention the dumplings??? They are super satisfyingly satiating!"
"I've been to this place once, and I have to honestly say its alright!  The tacos are tasty, I had the shrimp and kalbi tacos.. I also tried the kimchi pork fries and it was good.. If I were to go back, I'd probably try the Bahn mi sandwiches."
"after hearing friends from california rave about the korean taco trucks...i now get the hype about this new craze.  it's a pretty delicious concept, and i think it is executed well at del seoul.  i went with a group and we had tacos: kalbi, shrimp, pork; fries: kimchee and gamja; dumplings, spicy bbq chicken banh mi, and veggie hot stone bibimbop.  yeah, it was a ton of food.overall, i think the kalbi and shrimp tacos were the winners of the group.  the slaw that is on top of the tacos is a really nice addition to the well-flavored meat.  the shrimp is fried, so it's kind of hard to mess it up, but it was nice a crispy without being overcooked.  the fries were good, but they are pretty greasy.  the kimchee fries can be really overwhelming, and it's a good appetizer to share between a couple of people.  there was not a lot of pork belly on the fries, which was kind of disappointing, but they were still good.  the banh mi was slightly disappointing because the bread is a bit too chewy, instead of crusty.  i didn't try the bibimbop, but my friend said that it was just okay.  in my opinion, stick with the tacos and you'll leave satisfied."
"I died and went to food heaven today. To begin with, their steamed pork dumplings are probably the best dumplings I have ever had. They were so juicy and tender....my mouth is watering just thinking about them. Then, the Spicy BBQ chicken taco far exceeded my expectations. The chicken had great flavor that was greatly enhanced by all of the vegetables with Korean chili sauce. There was a weird interplay of extreme Asian flavors and the Mexican undertones of the tortilla. But, it works extremely well and am already planning my next visit back. Have no qualms about it, you will not be disappointed here."
"A unique twist on Korean street food! Quite tasty and reasonably priced. The tacos have good flavor with a nice slaw on top. I especially like the shrimp tacos. It does get a little messy, but you'll be able to get the good stuff in your mouth before it falls apart. I agree with Stacey P that the beef could be more marinated, and the pork could be a little more seasoned. The service is nice and fast too. I'll be looking for this place anytime I'm hungry on Clark St."
"these korean taco places are popping up everywhere, but i've got to say this is one of my favorites. the spicy pork and kalbi tacos were both excellent. dumplings were fresh with a silky wrapper. kimchi and pickles were also very good. food came out quick and left us wanting more."
This place gets packed on Friday nights and  during the weekend... Good thing it looks like they will be expanding into the building next-door soon!! :) :) :)
Amazing fries! Steak tacos and bim bim bop is so delicious. I am so glad you opened up in my neighborhood. A great compliment to the diverse eateries in the neighborhood. I love Crisp ( another korean joint) which is down the street. But i can leave Del Seoul just as satisfied and save myself a few bucks. Stone bowl Bim Bim bop with steak. That's whats up !
"I've never seen myself nor my boyfriend put away a meal so quickly... it was so delicious. We tried 1 of every taco, our fav being chicken... the shrimp is fried and that sort of turned me off.  We ordered the pork belly fries as well... heaven. I can't wait to go back and try the dumplings. Not much seating in there, but I don't know if I'd be able to carry-out it's so good and I'd want it right then!"
"They've expanded now so the stuck up Asian broads that work here won't be able to justify the RESERVED signs they leave on the tables anymore. I swear, I've been here plenty of times with groups and have had to nearly beg to sit at those reserved tables."
"I haven't had much REAL Korean food so I don't have much to compare the cuisine to, but I feel comfortable saying the food is delicious.  I could have eaten about 10 chicken tacos because they are somewhat small and my only real complaint was that I ran out of money after finishing 3 or 4.  Very nice staff and the music in the place was perfect for the relaxed atmosphere.  I'll be heading back to try more of the menu, but the tacos had sooo much flavor it will be hard for me not to order 10 the next time I'm there."
"Del Sol's not bad. Korean syle tacos? I tried all 4 tacos and it was ok. Creative but not bad. The dumplings aren't bad either but if it's something you had before than it's ok. Now for some really good tacos, why not Big Star and get the pineapple tacos? Mmm..."
"Best dumplings I've had in a while. So good. And the chicken taco was so tasty! I need to come back asap. Plus, it's pretty cheap for such a delicious taco. Who knew that korean food tasted so damn good wrapped in a tortilla? Well, now I know."
"Yum!  What can I say?  I'm a fan of Asian and Latino fusion...  Surprisingly, I enjoyed the shrimp tacos more than the kalbi tacos.  Big fan off the Kim Chee fries.  No doubt we'll be back for more!  Those fish tacos are calling me.... mmmm"
"The bulgogi sandwich was awesome. The kim chi fries were awesome. The food here is good, served quick and the staff is really friendly. Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
when my brother said he was taking me out for shrimp tacos i wasnt too excited.. little did i know they would soon be one of my favorite tacos in chicago!
"Interesting combination of korean and mexican food but it definitely works. Probably the best thing they have to offer is their kalbi tacos. If you're really hungry, I would get a side dish too. Beware that their seating is limited, so be prepared to eat your food outside or takeout at home."
"Tried Del Seoul after seeing it on here, and I was definitely impressed.  I had the Kalbi Taco, and the shrimp taco.  I also tried the kimchi fries, and I enjoyed them all.  I highly recommend trying this place out.  Very clean inside and the staff was also very friendly."
"Okay so when I first heard that del Seoul would be next to my place, I was really excited. I went in when they first opened the doors, and enjoyed it very much. The problem is that I can't trace it officially to this place but every other time we had the shrimp taco we didn't end up having the best night/morning. They also seem to dump cilantro onto the sandwich, which the flavor over powers the whole thing. Overall it's not a bad place but I do hesitate going again."
If this place were closer to my house we'd have a serious problem. Since it's so damn far and traffic on weekends sucks I don't think I'll be coming here too often. But the kalbi and shrimp tacos were awesome. I think we may have made a mistake by not ordering the dumplings since basically every table had them so maybe next time. The tacos were a good size but were overflowing with cabbage/slaw. This place is definitely a nice change of pace from regular tacos....now please open up in the west loop in one of the million empty store fronts...K thanks!
"3.5 stars. Pretty decent for something fast, good and cheap! I had just driven past there a couple times and was so curious about this new joint. We ordered 3 tacos (chicken, pork and kalbi). The kalbi was the best but they all pretty much tasted the same. Also got the dumplings.. nothing special at all, in fact I was a little underwhelmed. And, I had to try the fries...since they were ""Korean"" fries. The fries themselves I didn't like too much but I liked the garlic aioli it came with. The food came out super fast and it was fresh and good. Would definitely recommend it for an easy lunch or dinner."
"Had to go to this place because everyone was talking about it and also because of all the good reviews it got on yelp!! First off im Korean and ive never had any sort of ""Korean taco"" of anything of that nature, which is one of the main reasons why i ventured all the way to lincoln park to eat here. by the way i live in schaumburg.The prices are very reasonable and the side dishes are very good too. Kimchi Fries Anyone??!! mmmm...They also sell some Korean snacks and drinks which are very good to those who have never had any before.  I consider them to be healthier alternatives compared to american snacks/drinks, just my opinion...Ill keep this short.try the kalbi,bulgogi,shrimp taco and the kimchi fries, good stuff.wish it was closer to where i live....."
"Tacos are great. I haven't had anything like that before. Well balanced, light and reasonably priced. Bibimbap was nothing to write home about."
"Fast, inexpensive, and unique. Lovers of traditional Korean bbq stay away. If you don't mind a little twist though, this will become a favourite."
Shrimp tacos are the best!!! The rumor was true :)
If your from CA and tried the Kogi BBQ trucks this place blow it out of the water.  The kalbi taco are the best
The selections are little but they do a good job on the food. I'd recommend for a causal and inexpensive lunch or dinner.
"I've only been here once and I've already woken up in the morning multiple times with an intense craving to go to Del Seoul. Their Korean tacos are amazing! The cabbage slaw on top is refreshing, crunchy, and fresh. It goes perfectly with the meat underneath, which is perfectly cooked. What totally does it for me when it comes to their tacos is their secret sauce; that's what brings the slaw and the meat together into one cohesive party of bold flavors! For such a low price, I was happily surprised to see how loaded the taco was. One thing I didn't like was the blandness of the tortilla. I know that traditionally, tortillas are not really flavored, but it just didn't seem to work for me. You have all of this awesomeness--fresh slaw, bold sauce, tender and delicious meat, but it's all sitting on top of a flavorless flour tortilla. It's like serving hundreds of dollars' worth of black truffles with stale bread. I get that they were aiming for balance, but for me, I'd rather eat all of the stuff with flavor and discard the tortilla. Flavorwise, the tortilla has no place in this dish, except for the purpose of allowing them to call it a taco. I also ordered the dumplings. I love the meat to dumpling skin ratio; they really pack in a lot of filling, which is very delicious. However, the dumpling skin/wrapping was too gooey for my liking; it was way too thick. If the wrapping was 1/2 the thickness, it would be perfect. The dipping sauce was phenomenal though."
"Chicago's first casual taco joint!   Was excited to see and taste this and compare to the other relatively recent Korean-inspired restaurants that have hit the Chicago area.  Went on a Saturday for lunch, and it was quite busy.  We tried the kalbi tacos, spicy bbq pork tacos (liked these better), and the kimchi pork belly fries.   All were good, well balanced in flavor, with enough heat, sweet, and salt to be authentially Korean.   I would be interested to see if dukkboki ever makes the menu..."
This place is simply awesome. Love it. Love it. Love it.
"The goods: the sesame-chili shrimp taco, the tempura fish taco, and the dolsot/stone bowl bibimbap."
Combining two of my favorite cuisines--Korean and Mexican is a winning idea in my book. I know the concept is not new but its novel in Chicago and Del Seoul does a great job of it. The Kalbi taco is very memorable and tasty. I wished I had ordered more. The shrimp taco is very tasty and worth a try. I am a dumpling freak and Del's do not disappoint. Service is quick which means you get your craving satisfied as soon as you get them. I hate to recommend this place because I loathe to face the crowds that will be there once its fully discovered
"Kalbi tacos and fries to go is what i ordered. It was pretty good, not great. If youre in the mood for something different, go ahead and give this place a shot. The food was quite rich, especially the garlic dipping sauce for the fries. Not terrible value for your money either. I'd probably go back when in the right mood, but nothing to really blew my mind."
"Its true, Im addicted. I cant help but consume the shrimp & BBQ pork tacos at least twice a week. And the pork dumplings?? Delicious. I also truly enjoyed the Kimchi & Pork Belly fries. Pretty much anything on the menu will be flavorful and amazing. I keep going back to try it all!"
"I cannot say enough good things about this place!  Although it doesn't look like anything special from the outside...the food says it all!  Once you bite into a Kalbi taco you will understand why this place is always full of hungry people!  Recently my parents came to Chicago who are a little adventurous than we are but they LOVED it!  The food is amazing every single time, it comes out fast, and you will not be disappointed!"
"Like some of the other reviewers mentioned, I'm not a big fan of the ""don't seat yourself"" signs that bombard guests when they walk in, and I've had a couple of less than perfect service experiences here (e.g. on my last visit, i waited 35 minutes for my taco order, because they apparently lost the ticket).However, I still give Del Seoul 5 stars for the always satisfying food and great combination of flavors in every menu item that I've tried.  The tacos, kimchi fries and bibimbop are all wonderful.  The skin of the dumplings is a little too thick, in my opinion, but the flavors are great.  Overall, a great addition to Chicago and a regular spot for me!"
"Absolutely fantastic korean style tacos.  The beef shortrib taco is easily the best thing on the menu followed closely by the shrimp taco.  I just recently had the dumplings and they were also pretty incredible.  I've only ever had Del Seoul as take-out so can't comment on inside dining experience but my order is always ready within 10-15 mins.  The fries here leave something to be desired but everything else I've ever had has been top-notch.  If you're in the mood for a little change of pace on your normal beef/chicken tacos give this place a shot, you will not be disappointed."
Get the bim bim bop! So fresh and delicious. It will change your life! Mmmm
"Absolutely loved this place! The tacos are all awesome, the prices are great and the staff is nice! My husband and I got a whole feast, including 3 different kinds of tacos (kalbi, grilled pork and chili shrimp), the steamed dumplings, a banh mi and a side order of fries. It was all delicious, and came in right around $30, I think (but only because we completely over-ordered). Love this place! Thanks Yelp!"
I heard so much about Del Seoul and it a block from my office. I tried ordering something healthy and not spicy but had a hard time. I found the food way to spicy for my taste even after ordering it mild. Turns out the shrimp in the  shrimp tacos was deep fried.  I don't do fried food. since everything else on the menu is either beef or spicy I won't be going back. Toro Sushi or Oodles of Noodles down the street are much better bets!
"Have been here a couple of times for lunch.  Great to see chicago finally catch onto the korean taco trend.  Have tried all the tacos, 2 of the banh mi sandwiches, the kimchi fries, and the dumplings.  All of the tacos and the 2 banh mi I tried are really flavorful and not too expensive.  Bulgogi and Kalbi are my favorites of the bunch.  Kimchi fries and dumplings are solid but nothing stands out about them."
Lives up to all the hype. Get the kimchi fries! Can we get BYOB in here?
"I tried the the pork, shrimp, and kalbi tacos as well as the kimchi fries. Everything was out of this world. The meat was flavorfully korean tasting while the cilantro and tortilla gave them a mexican twist. The kimchi fries were pretty good too. The new 'not it' was created here.I will visit again soon."
I'd give it ten stars if I could. I won't say much more except that the kimchi is perfect and a must-have with every meal.
