Leadbelly
"Standout in my neighborhood! I usually never rave over burgers, but this is one I say is a must try: super delicious, juicy, and tasty!!! Have been here a few times since moving in the neighborhood and always come out stuffed, but content. The one mistake I always make is ordering two fancy fry baskets. If you are with at least one other person and are trying the fries other than just the house fry...remember that it is like ordering a meal. I ordered the belly fries on my last visit and barely made a dent. Don't worry I wasn't that sad because they made some damn tasty leftovers.Yes, the space is small so if you don't plan to go, like when they open, then don't be surprised to wait. The wait is worth it, but it's best to be prepped for it so don't go when you are super cranky and uber hungry. I wouldn't say the service is slow per say, it's just that the meals are made with love and it shows. I mean damn....even their shakes are tasty (and I'm not a shake person)!On my most recent visit I had the 'house of the rising sun' and although a few years ago I thought an egg on a burger was unheard of, now I feel like it's a must. A must when you have an especially juicy burger with equally top notch bread to sop up that yolky goodness!"
"It breaks my heart to give this place 3 stars instead of 4 or even 5. I had high expectations for Leadbelly and I'm sorry to say but I was quite disappointed. I was looking forward to adding it to my ""Best Burgers in Chicago"" list, but it didn't make the cut. Darn. I ordered the 'Amazing Grace' burger which was topped with smoked pork belly, crispy onion straws, homemade spicy sriracha pickles, and mustard BBQ. My friend ordered the, 'The Gallows Pole' which was topped with swiss, onions and mushrooms. We also split the garlic and parmesan fries. One order of fries was enough for the both of us. It's a place where you order at the counter, you get a number, you seat yourself, and then they bring the food out to you. We found a nice spot out on their front patio. When the burger was brought out it LOOKED spectacular. However, the first bite was not magical like I had hoped...not at all whatsoever. The pork belly was too chewy and unfortunately I had to take it off because I couldn't bite through it while it was in the burger. I wish I had ordered a bacon burger instead. The burger meat was...different? First off it was not juicy at all, very dry, maybe it was more lean, but I know what lean ground beef tastes like that, and that is not it either. It tasted overcooked even though I saw it was pink bc I ordered it medium well so I'm not sure what was going on there, but I didn't like it. The bun was just okay, I think it was a brioche type of bun, which my friend enjoyed more than I did. The HIGHLIGHT of the meal was the fries. I thought they were fantastic and I would come back just for the fries."
"VERY DISAPPOINTED, expected more from all the hype.The burger I had was so greasy - the fat/meat ratio was more fat than usual...so much that it should been called LARD ON A BUN.The Bread it was in was so airy and light it tasted like the cheapest bread at Aldi's.The fries are so soggy and oily - they taste like mashed baby food in fry form.The only positive thing is their large beer selection."
"I so wanted to like this place. I have been meaning to try it out forever. I finally made it there and was a bit disappointed.I ordered a Leadbelly with jalepeno jack cheese and garlic parmesan fries. My friend ordered the chipotle fries and we shared both.The burger was huge, but it wasn't awesome. The meat tasted overcooked and wasn't very juicy. The bun had a garlic-y smear on it, which I didn't care for too much. The sriracha pickles were great though. As for the fries, they had almost too much garlic on them. I liked the chipotle fries best, but it would be difficult to eat a whole basket of them. They were rich.I bought the burger, fries, and a beer and the total came in just over $18. Not what I expected from what I thought was a burger joint.As for atmosphere, I loved the posters and rocker vibe. There were quite a few tables inside, and there is a patio area. It looked like it was going to rain, or else we would have sat outside. It was rather loud inside though. They were playing what seemed to be a Dave Matthews Band live concert DVD. I thought maybe the volume level only bothered me, but I saw someone ask the cashier to turn the volume down, so I guess it wasn't. The cashier turned it down 2 levels. Still too loud.I think I would try this place one more time, but if I didn't like the food again, I wouldn't be back for a third time."
"A nice stop while in Portage Park. We hit up Leadbelly on a nice warm Saturday night, and the patio and the place was hopping. I liked the rock 'n' roll portraits and live concert playing on the big screens. Someone has a big jones for Kurt Cobain here, and that's alright. I guess he's associated with Leadbelly the blues artist by way of MTV Unplugged, ding ding, Final Jeopardy!I ordered the Leadbelly original burger, and the house fries with sea salt and pepper. The burger was okay, NOT WOW, the Best, Jerry! Definitely just okay. The house fries were almost devoid of sea salt, and I would like to see a sweet potato fries option. The beer selection here is pretty amazing, and the service is really nice. They do have a small patio, and I did like that I saw people of all ages and all races enjoying this place. A unique burger place in a unique place, Portage Park."
"Meh, I was unimpressed.Extremely small space.  Far drive for us.  Parking is street.  Staff was nice.Food was really mediocre and tasteless.  The best part about the burgers were the buns...which is kind of sad.  There wasnt much flavor.  We had the midnight special...and it was plain, boring.  The black betty was delicious but I think it was because of the pungent blue cheese helped out the very bland burg.  Fries were good, but not worth coming all the way out here.It just didnt do anything for us.  Bums"
"I saw Leadbelly on some list of best burgers, but I had never had it. We ordered here for lunch today and low and behold, I've discovered yet another quality burger joint!!I had the ""Old Time Religion"" which is a delicious, high quality beef patty (I could taste it) on what was a soft, fresh, homemade bakery bun, with arugula, roasted tomatoes, goat cheese and truffle aoli. Wow. Talk about great ingredients and flavor combinations! The burger was so good -  the truffle aoili and goat cheese gave such a savory tone to it, while the peppery arugula and roasted tomatoes blended nicely and complimented these flavors! The bun was huge and I had some left, but again, I appreciated the fact that it was not your usual hamburger bun. I would like to eventually try other burgers on their menu, and even go in to experience the restaurant. For now, though, I am definitely a fan!!"
"I am so glad my husband and I found this place on Yelp!! I ordered the easy rider and it was delicious. We also got a side of fries and a chocolate shake. The shake was good - nothing to rave about but was a nice sweet treat after that meal. They don't have fountain drinks, they sell cans of soda. My husband liked that when he ordered a coke, he was able to go back and get another without additional cost. I'm expecting so we didn't try any beer but can't wait to go back when we can! We also loved the outdoor seating area. It's perfect for a nice summer evening. Can't wait to bring our friends & family here!!"
"Them buns though!!! I bookmarked Leadbelly Burgers long ago when I read a list somewhere of Chicago's Best Burgers. So this year one of my resolutions is to go to all my bookmarked places. My friend wanted to go to Kuma's but we decided to come here since neither of us have been before. Leadbelly's is a top contender for top burger. I can't say it's the best because I haven't tried them all yet!!! We got the Black Betty and the Easy Rider and both were delicious. We also ordered the Parmesan Garlic fries. Those could've been a bit more crisp but we did come on a very busy Saturday night so I won't dock a star. Although they were packed, the service was still good and we didn't feel rushed to leave. The bun really stood out to me. So buttery and slightly crispy. It made the burger even better. I loved the flavor profiles each burger had to offer. I am not at all a blue cheese fan but I do like it with beef. And the Black Betty was perfect. Not overwhelming but you could still taste it. On the Easy Rider I loved the homemade sriracha pickles, they should fry those up and make them a side! My friend loved the beer variety they had to offer and she was super excited to see one her favorites from Three Floyd's in the cooler. I loved the butter cookie as a little sweet treat after dinner. Even though we were stuffed we couldn't resist those cookies. I will definitely be back soon to try another burger. But I will probably come on a weekday to avoid a long wait for a table and my food. And I will also get some cookies to go!"
"You guys are so gonna hate me. But I do not love this place. This place is right around the corner from me so I've been here 3 or 4 times now in the last 8 months or so. Each time getting a different burger. I'm trying really Frickn hard to love this place. :( I cant! The burgers are not great. The bun has an almost garlicky taste that I do not love. The meat patty is thick as a mother brother but It's not melt in your mouth goodness like some of the others. The fries are solid but once you get half-way through their cup it's served in the fries get so small I can't dip them in my ketchup any more. My fingers have ketchup on them. Wahh! Leadbelly's is a wonderful establishment for the neighborhood and is very well run, soo I really do want to love this place. However the burgers do not compare to those of Lockdown, Au Cheval, and Paramount Room ( Thanks Alex A.) Step up your game Leadbelly If you want my love. You got my number!"
"I just swallowed one of the best burger I have had in a while...they claim that they blend and make their own meat, sauce, bread - and i believe them...the asymmetrical bread with all of its imperfection in visual design - is complimented with the savory taste of the buttery blend...my heart was pounding with each bite (not sure because it's so good and juicy or that my arteries are working extra hard - probably combinations of both)...the price is not bad either....will cost you about $7 for a burger...but don't eat too much otherwise a bi-pass heart surgery will cost you about $350,000...now where did i put my blood pressure meds..."
"I really don't know how people like this place??? The place is tiny and no room for people to sit. The food was HORRIBLE!!! The fries were tasteless and soggy!!! The Burger was even worse. And don't get me started on the service. Who hires these people and how did they even be consider to work in the restaurant business. What a joke!!! I will never be back and I will make sure to tell people that this place SUCKS!!!! If you want a good burger go to LockDown's or Kuma's!!! They know what a burger is suppose to be. Yelp really needs to allow us to give ""0 stars"""
Had a great time there on Friday last. Friends had recommended the place. We were very impressed. Great food in a great atmosphere.
Ricidulous burgers. So happy they are close to home.
"Pretty good! A bit pricey in my opinion, but the food was great. I don't remember the exact names, but my burger had bernaise sauce with mushrooms and onions, my boyfriend had the one with goat cheese, and his sister had one with Bloody Mary sauce. While we all liked our food, I think the Bloody Mary sauce burger was the table favorite. Also, we got The Whip spiked milkshakes and they were spectacular. I would go back just for those!!!!"
"Delicious & Unpretentious. Creative gourmet burgers with a cool atmosphere...they were playing the David Bowie Live DVD while we were there. Outdoor seating and easy parking at this Portage Park spot! I am sick of overhyped burger joints. This one is the real deal. Homemade buns, burgers, fries, and gourmet sodas. My new go-to!"
"I realize that it's easy to hop on here and be negative, so i'm going to start writing about my positive experiences. Especially when burgers are involved...--------------------------------------------------­---------------------------------------------Here's the thing about Leadbelly; it's a great time. I was going to give them four stars because it's a bit out of the way, but hey, it's a double-edged sword.One one hand, yes, it's off the beaten path from where i usually haunt. But on the other it's a diamond in the rough and you're probably not going to have to wait four hours to sit down. Ehhhem, Original Kumas.They were busy enough that i didn't get suspicious, but not so busy that we couldn't sit down right away. Here's a pro tip: pre game with a cocktail next door at the Martini Bar. It's a weird Eastern-Euro vibe, where they blast electro music and don't pay for premium Spotify so you have to listen to commercials (don't ask me why, but it just feels right). No one was in the place. It was like being at a night club on a Monday afternoon even though it was night time. Our group-appropriately dubbed 'Meat Hunks'-sat in one of their plush VIP booths and enjoyed a syrupy martini before heading in to devour burgers.On to the burger. I had the Old Time Religion (good enough for me!). Holy shit. So good. It didn't fully sink in until this morning how much i loved this burger. And those fries. Mang. I had the blue cheese fries and washed em down with a couple craft beers from the folks at Three Floyds. The classic live Nirvana MTV Unplugged set played on the big screen completing the homey vibe. A great Meat Hunks outing. One of my favorite overall experiences.Congrats, Leadbelly, you've made it in to my top five Chicago burgers list. Perfectly cooked, medium rare. Great variety of topping styles. Cozy space. Friendly folks working there. Great bottle selection. Thoughtful rock-based theme done tastefully and not in your face. Makes me want to go back right now to try another.You join the ranks of: 1. Kuma's Motorhead2. Owen & Engine's burger (no add-ons)3. The Harding Tavern's THT4. LEADBELLY's Old Time Religion5. Square Bar's Lobster tail and Brie BurgerMan. Way to go, you guys."
"Based on the reviews, I'm sure their actual restaurant might be great. However, I don't think this place is set up well for catering. I bought a burger from them at Fooda, which offers businesses a chance to cater lunch at offices. My burger was red and cold inside. I don't like to complain (or give bad reviews..) but this was terrible. I went back to tell them in case there are other raw burgers. The response was ""We undercook them since they need to sit in the trays.""Meat should be cooked to the proper temperature and also kept at a high enough temperature to be safe. Neither of these happened for my lunch. I was offered a replacement burger, however it was cold as well. At least it looked cooked, even overcooked. I did not feel safe eating this one either.My coworkers' burgers seemed cooked enough, however they commented they were cold also. I do not think this business should cater/ offer Fooda services."
"Love the food they cook up here. If you are ever in the mood for a QUALITY burger, then this is the place to be. The atmosphere is calm, the people are nice, the fries are mouthwatering and the lines are always short...but that last one is subject to change quickly. My suggestion: Midnight Special. You can't go wrong with that."
"Visiting from Colorado, and stopped in on way back to hotel b/c of the Yelp reveiws. Have to admit, great burger(Gallows Pole), cookie & service! Owner stopped by to see how everything was... found that nice!"
"Really really good food. We stopped in here for a quick bite before heading to the airport after a short conference in town.The food was awesome. The fries were insanely good. and they have some really good cookies... My only issue, and it's personal, was that there were no all beef options. I don't eat pork so... all the beef was off limits. Boo... the chicken was good too but I really wanted a beef burger. My fault for not checking. However, everything was super duper tasty!"
"A super delicious chill place with awesome rock music and we saw the Who live in concert on the tv when we visited this joint for the first time.Looong overdue visit. Beautiful Sunday afternoon on sunny day in December.No wait. We were thinking we might have the wrong place when we arrived around 1. Guess people were watchin the Bears lose their final game this season.Lucky us. We stared at the overhead menu boards and each got a burger. Portobello or chicken cutlet are the other base options to go with the very tasty topping heavy burgers.We got the first 2 on the left. Mine was with lots of crispy bacon and very tasty n crunchy homemade pickles. I went up and had to ask for more.Good basket of plain fries, tho toppings abound to top the fries.Good shake. Dang root beer really had me saying dang after my first sip. Lasty, to go, we got the Elis cheesecake filled beignets. Mostly to help in the fundraising effort by Leadbelly. These we at later at home, and feel that we did our part today by giving and eating these ridiculously genius donuts should get a mention in my review. A Bag of powdered sugar to go is the best. Truly. Genius."
"I have no beef with Leadbelly.Seeing as though the only thing I don't like is the small space I'll get right into this.  Huge fan of concise menus. Play to your strengths and that's what they do. The specialty burgers here are seasoned well and this summer I hope to run a train on their menu from the burgers to the fries to the spiked shakes. For starters I had the House of the Rising Sun that comes with a fried egg naturally. I guess my only beef would be that it didn't come topped with lettuce and tomato. No matter the specialty I feel all burgers should come with that. The sriacha pickles are damn good as well. I only got the regular house fries but I'm sold on the pico and pork belly versions too. I see you summer. To make the visit that much more pleasant I was given a free drink by the lady at the register. And she was excited just because I was excited to be there for the first time haha. Service was on point and can get slow but I could tell the workers keep a close eye. The space is decorated pretty dope with rock memorabilia but again it's small. I don't like the feeling and act of battling and eyeing down tables with other patrons cause I promise you I will get to it first, nice guy or not. I know a second location just spawned and I'm curious as to the size but either way this menu has no chance with me."
"I'm into burgers... oh yes I'm into burgers, and Leadbelly is at the top of my favorite burgers in the city list. You can tell a great patty by ordering just the plain cheese burger and being blown away. Add on all the designer fixins that Leadbelly has and it's hard for me not to get this every night. It's a welcome part of the Portage Park neighborhood. The staff is always A+. And they have Sprecher bottled sodas. Yes, please!*warning: this place is small small so big groups get it to go and eat in the park!"
"We came here this past weekend to see if their burgers could really live up to the hype. Although I've kind of given up eating meat, boy gave his head nod of approval. He said it was better than Kuma's and even better than Au Cheval. He got the Leadbelly burger with fried egg, onion strings and mayo. I myself had a mushroom Leadbelly burger. The garlic parmesean fries were a little too greasy, but it had a great taste. Plus, it came with a free butter cookie! I'm not complaining, but perhaps let the customer know there's a nut in the cookie in case of peanut allergies? I enjoyed the trivia cards and shelf of condiments! Maybe I'll come back again and try a regular burger. Service was patient and attentive."
"Really surprised this place made it into some reputable top burger lists. Unless you live nearby and go when they aren't busy, this is not worth the trip.We went on a Saturday night and the place was packed, really highlighting how small the space is, and absolutely no one in the place was enjoying themselves. I scanned the room throughout our (2 hours?) time there, and you could not find smiles or laughter. Everyone was irritated, everyone was hungry and waiting, and if they were eating, they weren't absolved of all their moodiness and impatience by the food.   You are always in someones way, there is always someone waiting hovering over table or blocking the doorway, the walk-way, the line, the condiment bar, the bathroom.. Just CRAMPED in. And not in a charming way.  Whatever you do don't take a new date there on a busy night unless you want them to see the petty, irritable side of you that this place brings out. People were just complaining at every angle, in front of us, behind us, seated and waiting. There isn't anything 'stand out' about the burgers themselves, and the fries are a soggy amateur disaster. I got the Parmesan Garlic fries, and I've had better from Wing Stop take-out that has been smushed and sitting in a bag for an hour. Once home, 30 minutes in the toaster oven on Broil could not get the crispy. The temperature of their oil or their ratio of fries they are dumping is severely off. The burger cannot hold a match-stick to Owen & Engine, Au Cheval, Kuma's Corner, Lockdown, or really any of Chicago's ""Best Burgers."" It also doesn't score points to be a knock-off of a knock-off in the 'rock-burger' genre. Enough. Find something new and different, we have seen the rock-themed burger joint a few times before, and if they're asking us to put Leadbelly in the graces of, or comparable to Kuma's Corner or Lockdown, it is simply not happening.As I mentioned, yes it was crowded which means they are doing something right to attract a crowd.. perhaps mostly due to hyped and, in my opinion an un-deserved standing in Chicago burger rankings and publicity. If you take that away, you don't have much."
"Best burger I've ever had in my life and I'm a 36 y.o. Chicagoen foodie so that should tell you something! I had the black Betty burger and it was delish! The place was small but they had a huge tv and we're playing cool music videos all night long.  The staff was very nice and they have a good beer selection too. The only know was it took about 20 minutes for my burger to be ready but to be honest, it was well worth it. 5 stars all the way!!"
"Its not very often that I can't find something to complain about in a food place.....o.m.g best burger ever!  Best fries ever! Edzos, Kumas, and Au Cheval are rated top notch in chicago but leadbelly is gonna give them a run for their money.  Excellent service! Quality ingredients you can taste!"
Amazing place with awesome service!! Their buns are homemade and their burgers are to die for! Definitely recommend this place.
"Great and friendly service, the garlic parmesan fries are amazing!!! Oh and the butter cookies are the best cookies I've ever had! Yum!!!"
"2/10      Easy Rider burger2/10      Ambiance10/10    Butter CookiesIt all sounded so promising, name sounded interesting, read some great reviews, pictures made it look delish, music was appealing, but unfortunatelyIT DIDN'T LIVE UP TO THE HYPE........just MEH!!Ordered the Easy Rider,which came with melted cheese, Bourbon (not really) BBQ sauce (tasted more like Open Pit!) and smoked (?) bacon, that had no flavor.  The meat seemed like it was frozen and then thawed, not very fresh tasting.  Maybe it was a LEAD burger, it certainly looked and tasted heavy and dry, completely devoid of any flavor!  Bun was okay, but not as good as I was expecting, even though it was homemade.  Glad I didn't order the fries, which I read on Yelp weren't that great anyways.  The whole thing came to almost $10 and that was w/o a drink.The surprise though was my order came with a complimentary butter cookie, drizzled with chocolate. Those were delish! If ever I was in Portage Park again, I'd order the cookies and skip everything else.Side Note:  Parking is terrible around here, it's even worse than Lakeview and nothing's worse than Lakeview, even the streets are bad, unpaved surfaces and humongous potholes."
I went to leadbelly for a burger club monthly excursion.I am notoriously a positive reviewer of burgers overall but I gave the leadbelly burger my lowest score ever by quite a few points.The bun was the best part of the burger which is really sad.I ordered my burger medium and I got it much closer to well done.The meat was a weird texture and about an inch thick.I did enjoy my toppings but overall the burger was Meh.The fries I got were the parmesan and garlic and they were mushy. Our whole group (8) got burgers and fries and no one was impressed.For all the hullabaloo when this opened I was hoping for a lot better.I complained about the 7 mile trek out there and there is no way I will be returning.
"Leadbelly's is our family favorite... meat lovers get delicious hamburgers, vegetarians get amazing portabella burgers. Seriously, they're take it to the next level. Delicious, unique, and the atmosphere is fun. No soggy fries - and rather the fries are decadent. No crappy beer - a fantastic selection. And boozy milkshakes? Hello!! Finally, the burgers come with a cookie! And if you have kids, they happily will make grilled cheese (which i don't think is on the menu). So happy to have them in the neighborhood - so happy they've been so successful. The reviews, recognition, and write ups are true - they are awesome."
"Unfortunately the last time we were here, both my husband and I got food poisoning. (Hence the 3 stars). We haven't been back since but I had been there a few times before, and they did not disappoint. I remember I had ordered the Old Time Religion, with yummy arugula, goat cheese, tomato and some kind of garlic aioli. Phenomenal. They've also got a nice selection of craft brews. It's a small space, though, and they don't take reservations and it's hard to find seating. Parking is easy to find though. It's a nice place for hanging out but only with one other person since it's hard to find a spot to sit. But otherwise, great service and food; it may have just been an isolated incident with the food poisoning but I definitely remember that and it was not pleasant!"
"Blah blah, standard Celiac thing. But what I miss most about burgers are how they are wrapped neatly into a tasty bun. Leadbelly makes a great burger, AND they have GF buns!"
"Glad I got to try this place out. I'm not usually a girl that goes to a restaurant and orders a ""burger"", but when I do I expect that burger to be delicious. Leadbelly did not disappoint. The restaurant itself is pretty small and seating is limited. You order your food at the counter, take a number, and grab a seat. While you wait for your food you get to watch some awesome television (we were treated to live Queen and Nirvana DVDs).     The wait for the food was a tad bit long, but it didn't bother me too much. I got the Black Betty burger, my husband got the special burger ""Van the Man"", and we split a Belly Fry. The burgers were cooked perfectly to order (medium). The blue cheese and thick bacon on my burger was so tasty. My husband enjoyed his burger, but thought it was a tad bit too salty with the corned beef. The winner of the night, however, was the Belly Fry. Do not be afraid of the mustard on fries. It is sweet and delicious! And the bits of pork in there were drool worthy. I will return just for the fries alone.     Overall, great place, great food, great music, great place to hang with friends."
"Oh my lordy. All I have to say is GO TO LEADBELLY. Went with a group, and consequently, got to try five different burgers including my own... each more delicious then the next. I dont know remember the specific names of the sandwiches, but the fairly small menu has pretty much proven everything to be delicious. The joint is small, but the portions are big. I do eat a lot, and I was overly content after my meal. Just as their array of burgers greatly varies, so does there craft selection... a nice thing to keep in mind. ALSO dont forget the parmesan fries!!! God I hope I dont get diabetes anytime soon. Deserves a 5 star because for what it is (a small little burger joint), it pulls it off insanely well with perfectly cooked and flavorful burgers, lots of beer, and delicious fries."
"I came here with my mom and sister since we have heard some great things about their burgers. We ordered our burgers, three of their fries and found a spot as some guys were leaving. The table was cleaned right away and we enjoyed the AC/DC concert footage while we waited for our burgers. Our burgers were delicious, and the three different fries we ordered were amazing. I definitely recommend the Chipotle fries topped with Fritos! All in all, great service! Good for dates, families or just an amazing burger."
"We continued our recent burger binge at Leadbelly, which is a fairly recent addition to Portage Park.  It's a rock-themed burger joint that fires on all cylinders: friendly staff, great service, clean facility, and of course, exceptional food. We stopped in on a Sunday evening so it wasn't packed.  This is a place without pretension so you just step up to the counter, place your order, and they'll bring it to your table when it's ready.  We got three burgers, all of which were extremely good.  I'm talking about the kind of good when you just close your eyes and go, ""mmm.""My girlfriend got the Old Time Religion - roasted tomato, goat cheese, arugula and truffle aioli.  Damn, so simple yet so good.  My sister and I went with sweeter options, opting for the Amazing Grace and the Easy Rider, respectively.  Both had excellent sauces and delicious homemade pickles.  These burgers are also constructed very well.  My girlfriend's in particular was so expertly built.  Even though the burgers my sister and I got were bigger, they weren't sloppy, and they held up well to the numerous bites we took. Of course, the number one thing you look for in a burger is how well it's cooked.  Here, we asked for medium rare, and we got medium rare.  The patties were so soft yet still had that good ""bite"" you like in a burger.  They really know how to cook here.  The burgers weren't the only delicious offerings at Leadbelly.  We ordered the chipotle fries, and Leadbelly even includes their delicious butter cookie in each order.Our visit to Leadbelly was spur-of-the-moment, and we're so glad we decided to go.  Do yourself a favor and grab a bite at Leadbelly!"
"So I finally tried their burgers at the festival.  They had a tent there and I ordered the Old Time religion Burger and garlic parmesan fries.  First off, I was eager to try their burgers since I heard of all the rave reviews from other people.  However, I was disappointed.  My burger wasn't cooked that well...maybe the lady or guy in the tent who made my burger was under pressure to cook so many burgers at once that he or she thought they could slab a burger together and throw on all the fixings to cover it up.  I didn't eat all of the burger...it wasn't cooked enough and the truffle aioli was bland in taste with the consistency of a water downed mayo.  The fries were skinny fries with clumped up stuff on top. I've tasted better garlic parmesan fries at the Food truck Festival near the Cell.  This food truck also sold A-MA-ZING neopolitan style pizza!!!! Went there a couple years back, forget the name right now.   It's true that you cannot believe everything you hear until you experience for yourself!"
"They have amazing burgers and a great beer selection and that's all any real burger loving  human needs to know,extremely happy I live close to this place, don't question it just go."
"Leadbelly was good but not spectacular.  I had the easy rider which was pretty good, extremely messy. Use napkins. Bring napkins.  Did i say it was messy?  The buns are pretty awesome.  One problem with the place is that it took quite a long time to get served.  Which usually i have no problem with when the food was decent, but there wasnt many people in there.Id go back again. But wouldnt go too far out of my way"
"I stopped to get a carry out burger. It was a very busy saturday afternoon, so I figured I'd have to wait. BUT after 35 minutes of sitting on the bench where they told me to wait and someone would bring me my burger - I went to the counter and asked about my order. It was sitting with other burgers waiting to go out or be served. I think they forgot about me truthfully.Other than that, the burger was delicious! I got the Gallows Pole burger and even after waiting to get it home, it still tasted great."
Great and affordable food!!! Most burgers and sandwiches are under $10! Wait was a bit long and the interior is tiny and nothing special. But that crispy chicken was THE best chicken sandwich I've ever had! Fries were good. Beer selection is decent. Would love to return sometime!
"Good place to sit down with a burger and fries.  Portions are huge and the burgers are good quality.  Since rock and roll is my genre of choice, I like the videos that they play on the multiple screens in the restaurant.  My only knock is that the burger was a bit over spiced and not cooked the way I wanted it.  The person in the back had a heavy hand on the black pepper shaker and my medium well burger was barely medium.  I don't like drinking alcohol with my food, a personal preference.  They also have a large selection of unique bottled sodas.   I wanted a root beer and they had several different brands available.   Sugary liquid heaven to go with my burger.  Yum.  The wait staff was very friendly and the place is very clean."
THe burger is the best I've ever had! The bun and fries makes all the difference in the world.
"Awesome food, had the Black Betty, super delicious the buns are awesome and they have Fist City on tap, the garlic Parm fries are flame also. Would highly recommend this place!"
"AWESOME PLACE, EVERYONE GO HERE!! The patties are thick and the buns are delicious and don't turn to a mushy pieces as you eat your burger. I've tried the garlic fries and the buffalo fries and they are both delicously awesome.Ive tried Old time religion, easy rider, and black betty. I really enjoy the cheese they use in old time religion and black betty. All the burgers are great. Definitely eat here if you want a delicious and satisfying burger"
"I've been to Leadbelly twice for deliciously loaded burgers and fries with a few dashes of rock and roll thrown in.  The place can be easy to miss if you are whizzing by in your car on Irving Park Road west of Central Avenue.  The dining area is fairly small, so the etiquette of dining at Leadbelly is to order your food first and then you can be seated.  While waiting for your food you can look at the rock memorabilia on the walls, and watch a vintage Queen concert video (my friend swears that they were playing the same Queen video both times we dined there, and she might be right).  She also swears at the mirror in the ladies room, which is apparently situated too high for the average-height female to fully appreciate. Both times I ordered The Gallows Pole burger.  It is a sizeable and in-your-face stack with caramelized onions and mushrooms, smashed fries, swiss cheese and bearnaise sauce.  The hefty bun, with a buttery taste and topped with sesame, is tasty in its own right and holds together the beefy ensemble quite well.  Each order of fries is served in a cutesy deep fryer container.  I have had the Belly Fry, topped with chunks of pork belly, fried onion straws, and Carolina mustard sauce.  It sounds bizarre, but you can almost make a meal out of these fries.  The Garlic Parmesan fries are good too.  There are simpler burgers and fries too, which passed the taste test of our dining mate with less exotic tastes.  There are shakes (which can be spiked) and a pretty decent selection of craft beers to choose from.  Everyone also gets a butter cookie as a bonus treat.  While ""butter cookie"" sounds like one of those boring mass-produced cookies you get in a grocery store tin for 99 cents, Leadbelly's cookies are pretty decadently laced with drizzlings of white and milk chocolate along with pecans so they are more akin to pecan sandies. I was not sure if I was going to give Leadbelly 5 stars, but during my last visit I was getting full and wanted to save my last two-and-a-half bites of my burger along with a couple of fries to go.  The next morning I savored my two-and-a-half bite ""slider"" and fries, and wish I had a few more bites.  Now that's a good burger - so 5 stars it is for Leadbelly."
"Saw this place on check please and had to go. Showed up on a Friday night and it was full, but we didn't have to wait too long to sit. I was pretty indecisive and slow to order, but the guy at to counter (possibly an owner) was very patient. Put in the order and only had to wait a short while to sit.As for the food, amazing! Two people in our party got the portabella burger, one got the meat, all were delicious. The topping options are inventive and balanced. Fries, same applies. We even added on an extra order and they said we could settle the bill before we left. Standout is definitely the boozy milkshakes. I ended up splitting mine with wifey which was a big mistake. Bottom line: worth the trip to portage park if you want a break from kumas and lockdown. Also, their homemade buns make the difference."
"As someone who likes burgers and Aerosmith DVDs equally, Leadbelly was really in my sweet spot as they specialize in burgers and were playing an Aerosmith DVD during my meal. Good beef, fries and beer selection made for a pleasurable dining experience, without the wait you'd find for a comparable burger at most other locations. Worth the trek if you're a burger enthusiast and you ""don't wanna miss a thing."""
"The chicken sandwich  is not so great, the place is very small,  TVs are very loud BUT the hamburguers are delicious and juicy ,  the fries are made it with fresh oil, good quality meat."
This place is fantastic!   Great burgers (perfectly cooked as ordered) with amazing and fresh toppings.  Super delicious fries (preferred the parmesan).  Yummy sugar cookies.  Enticing and elaborate bottled beer menu.  We were lucky enough to come on a night where there was a special for beers on tap.  I was able to enjoy my Revolution with my burger!  Woohoo!  Service was excellent. The space was tight but nice!  Can't wait for another visit.
"I am kind of a hamburger snob.  I don't like pre-formed gray hamburgers.  I go for a hand formed thicker burger that can be medium rare on the inside and thoroughly  cooked on the outside.  This is exactly what I got at Leadbelly.  I ordered the ""Good Night Irene"" with the crab cake on top.  I ate the crab cake by itself.  It was delicious.  The hamburger was cooked just like I like it.  The toasted buttered bun was a perfect compliment to the meat.  They have several fancy fry choices.  We shared an order of pork belly fries with onion rings on top.  Yummy.  My only complaint, (and I know I am showing my age here) but the music was too loud.  When I couldn't hear my dinner partner not more than 2 feet away from me that's too loud.  Other than that it was a great experience.  I'll definitely be back."
"Heard a lot about the burgers, so I decided to get a carry-out meal. Amazing Grace was literally amazing. The Carolina mustard BBQ sauce gave it a great taste. I also had the Garlic Parm Fry, which was drenched in oil, resulting in soggy, drippy fries. Not sure if they went a little  heavy on the oil and parm, or if this is normal practice.Burger, good. Garlic Parm Fry, not so much"
I have come to crave these burgers.  I had to make it a point to bring friends that were in town from Central Illinois here for dinner and everyone left full and very happy with the food.  The seating is limited but if you plan for that you are in good shape.  Can not go wrong with a great burger from Leadbelly.
"HELLOOOOOOOO NEW FAVORITE BURGER JOINT!!!!This place is the best!!!! Came on Tuesday for $2 drafts and burgers, of course....... First impression, this place is small but well thought out! We are a the Portage Park location. The entire atmosphere is very well thought out. Love the Bowie concert on TV and excellent selection of rock n' roll prints.. especially vintage country selections like Cash and Tubb. Second impression, excellent service Pedro was a very patient and handsome face behind the counter who walked us through the whole menus and had patience with three indecisive women in a new restaurant. The food was excellent. Pedro even grilled up some jalepenos for me to spice yup my life. Parmesan garlic fries were standouts. Loved my Midnight Special. The cookie was a great addition, as well. Forget Kumas west-siders!!!!!!!!! Love love love Leadbelly!"
"I came to Chicago with a hunger. A hunger that hasn't been quenched since I last left New York City. I wanted Garlic Parmesan Fries and I wanted them bad.This is where it took me.Upon entering the modest establishment Friday night I was greeted to four TVs playing the Red Hot Chili Peppers live and a heavily pierced greeter manning the counter. The menu hangs above a counterful worth of craft brews of both the soda and beer variety. After much debate I order the Black Betty and Parmesan Garlic Fries with a Two Brothers Edelweiss. I took my number and generally spaced out to RHCP on the overhead monitors. Then the food came.What sat before my eyes was a thing of glory. The burger a clear 6 inches from table to top. The fries spilling over from their fryer basket. I took a bite and the garlic and Parmesan exploded across my taste buds. People like to talk about big flavor. Leadbelly is spilling over with flavor. It was an excellent burger and some delicious fries, and right as I thought my dinner was over, awaiting me nestled in a small wax baggy was the most delightful sugar cookie. It was perhaps the perfect compliment to a dinner well enjoyed."
"Best burger spot in town. Burger, garlic fries, and a craft beer all for under $20! If you live in the area definitely check it out. The whole place is decorated with classic rock bands and they play live music videos; The Eagles were playing this time. Leadbelly won another happy customer."
Oh yeah my wife and I went there once when they first opened. Great burgers and great fries. We need to go back.
"If you're going for a burger, make it worth your while and get a good one, and you'd be hard pressed to find better anywhere near Led Belly.  Very good quality of food, in a very comfortable environment.  Great selection of beers and ciders, great staff.  Everything about this place is right."
"Went here on a suggestion of a friend, but she did not quite explain the process so when I walked in I was pretty lost. The tiny sign that tells you to order at counter was covered by the people waiting. We ordered burgers and fries and drinks... Adult milkshakes were awesome and highly recommended... Burgers were a solid good, but nothing special. Fries were great and I'd go back just for that, but just not on a Saturday night"
"Went here last night with 2 friends and absolutely loved it. Food was great, tried the Easy Rider, the Pork belly/BBQ fries and a chocolate shake. The gluten free bun is as awesome as people say it is, I didn't miss the wheat AT ALL! Service was really great, they kept excellent track of who was next for the tables and food was served at a good rate. Not fast but not unreasonably slow and since it was all delicious I would have gladly waited a little longer! Only caveat, is that they are a tad on the high side, my meal was about $19, not horrendous, but definitely not a cheap meal!Can't wait to go back and try another burger on that yummy bun!!"
"We dropped in @6:30 on a Saturday - probably not the best time since it was jammed solid (and the place is puny as it is) - we almost bailed, but waited almost 10 minutes to order.Waited almost another 10 for a table to open up,and @40 more for our 3 burgers to arrive.Yes they were cooked to order and well-prepared but were too salty - not just the condiments, but the burgers too. The first two bites were great, it's just the seasoning caught up with me halfway through. I guess I'll come back in the future for something else on the menu, but for now I've satisfied my curiosity for the place."
"Amazing burgers! They use homemade buns  that just smell of butter!  Got the Old Religion (goat cheese, arugula, roasted tomato) - delicious! It's one of those burgers that you can taste how amazing every component is. The meat they use is delicious too!   Garlic Parm fries; classic & didn't disappoint. 1 order was large enough for 2 ppl to share.   Crazy big selection on NA bev, beer , mustards & hot sauce!   Seating is a bit tight so be prepared."
"Decided to try their carryout, and for the most part I wasn't disappointed. The ""old time religion"" burger was tasty, and had just the right amount of goat cheese. As expected, I sat on a bench waiting for a little bit, but their great beer selection kept me company. The only downside were the fries. The garlic Parmesan flavor was there, but the fries were downright soggy and limp. I'm not sure if it was the result of them being in the container for 5-7 minutes or if they were under cooked,but they definitely weren't crispy and delicious as was the case in my previous visits. Overall this place is awesome. Come try one of their creative burgers; drink some good beer; and take in some good live concerts they show on TV."
Always great food! Friendly staff and great beer selection.I live down the street and this is definitely one of the best burger places in the neighborhood.
Amazing Grace is very good and fries are nice. Wife thought her burger (easy rider) was ok. I be back to try Old religion and crab burger in the future.
Burgers are amazing! and the free cookie!
"Went to the North side today to attempt to get some Indian fusion tacos from a truck.  Which was 3 hours late. Next time the truck comes to me!  So we bailed on the truck idea and while enjoying a FFF draft at Fischman Tavern my wife hopped on Yelp and Leadbelly was the new destination.  We walked from Jefferson Park and arrived to a nice little restaurant with a serious burger menu and (IMO) an even more serious selection of bottled beers.  More Three Floyd's options then most liquor stores carry, some 5 Rabbit, cans of Rev, and a host of other good craft beers from outside Chicago to boot.We shared the Easy Rider which was slathered in a thick-as-thieves coating of Bourbon BBQ sauce and topped with cheddar cheese, bacon, and Siracha pickles.  The homemade bun was peppered with white and black sesame seeds and it was a nice change NOT to see a pretzel bun for once (that trend is approaching over played).  I didn't realize until after consumption that the burger patty had ground pork belly in it as well, so that might be part of the secret, but this was the best burger I've had in the city that I can recall.Fries, which often are a big handful of afterthought, were served in a mini fryer basket and the hand-cut and double fried Chipotle fries we opted for were topped with what appeared to be their Midnight Special burger's ingredients including pico, chili cheese Fritos, and a creamy orange Chipotle sauce (which was also readily available on the table in bottle form).  A nice little addition was a butter cookie topped with pecans with both white and dark chocolate drizzled over.  Their 'Adult Shakes' looked really good as we saw someone after us order one.  Next time.It was way past lunch time and it appeared most everyone there already had their food so the wait was quite short, but I hardly noticed while we read through the food-related trivia cards on the table and watched some vintage video of Queen in concert on their plasma screen.  We briefly chatted with the owners and said we were definitely coming back again and that we expected not to be the only ones.  They have only been open a few months but if the food is this good next time then forget about it; I'll have even less of a reason to ever want to stand in line for hours to get into Kumas and have my ears blasted off with metal (as posted over the bar at the Empty Bottle: ""you're not too old; it IS too loud."")After one visit I can find only one thing to complain about: the fact that they are not closer to home :)"
Solid. Solid burgers. Solid fries. Solid drinks. Good music on the flat screens. .. Nirvana unplugged to be exact.Small space... Friendly staff. Come enjoy this small space.
"Leadbelly is my Rock and Roll Heaven, and yes folks asBelinda Carlisle of the GO Go's fame sang Heaven is a Place on Earth.Leadbelly is as good as it gets, from the moment you enter this place withall the great rock posters of the legends from the 70's and 80's adorningit's walls.You see.. I was a teenager in the 70's and I loved my rock music andleadbelly gave me back some of my best memories.The interior of the restaurant holds about 6 tables and there is a counteralong the window where you can sit and look out onto Irving Park.And.. with the warmer weather approaching they have some tables outside as well.I ordered a burger named the ""Easy Rider"" which was this phenominalburger consisting of smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, homemade picklesand Bourbon Barbecue Sauce, all this on a pretzel roll.Honestly.. had to be the best burger I have had in my lifetime!It was perfection!Okay folks, there's more to come because the Garlic Parmesan Frieswere tremendous as well.And.. my chocolate shake and Leadbelly's Butter Cookies..pretty much to die for.So.. I would like to Thank everyone at Leadbelly for such a greatdining experience, Thank You for my frequent diner card which willentitle me to a free order of fries in 4 more visits.You know I will be back.. and I will bring my peeps with me!And.. to the Awesome Nicole.. It was great meeting you.. You Rock!So.. do yourselves a favor and stop into Leadbelly's..And.. stop into the ladies bathroom for there is a picture of Madonnaup on the wall ..(Her Like a Virgin Era)Just another bonus.. Madonna on the bathroom wall!God.. I Love You Leadbelly.."
"This is a must do for all Chicagoans! Good burgers, amazing loaded fries and boozy milkshakes (which sadly I've yet to try).Small clean interior with 6 tables but I prefer the small 6 table sidewalk patio.Both of our burgers were good , attributed in large part due to the sauces and toppings, the burger seemed to be a little dense and bland. Homemade buns topped with white and black sesame seeds was a nice touch and definitely held up to all the sauce slop!Amazing Grace burger with Carolina BBQ sauce, fried onions and pork belly was our favorite, the sauce was sweet and delicious.The Easy Rider burger was messy with its thick red BBQ sauce but with two thin slices of bacon I'm not sure the menu description of 'bacon, and more bacon' is really accurate!Polish fries were by far the best part of the entire meal, huge portion of extra crispy tater sticks smothered in melted cheese, kielbasa and sauerkraut. Blue Cheese fries were good, we loved the super spicy sauce on them but wished the blue cheese chunks were smaller. Its probably not near your house, but find a way to get there and check it out!"
"This is review #666 for me! I'm not going to get into a religious discussion about the significance or symbolism in this number, but I am going to bring up some Old Time Religion...the BURGER that is. The owner/manager was super nice and greeted everyone that came in. He made sure we knew about the menu and how the burgers are cooked to order, showed us the great selection of beer and craft sodas, milkshakes and alcoholic milkshakes. He also checked on us a few times during our meal to see if we were enjoying ourselves and if we needed anything. He was really sweet. For all your burgers you can substitute a chicken patty or a portabello mushroom. Ive been wanting to try the Old Time Religion--roasted tomato, arugula, goat cheese and truffle aioli. I was tempted to try it portabello mushroom style, but the thought of their beef patty (a mix of beef and smoked pork belly won me over). My burger was delicious. It was juicy, well-made and really flavorful. The arugula was very fresh and added a nice peppery-ness. The truffle was very subtle and the goat cheese was really creamy. Their house made bun held up nicely and was perfectly toasted as well. Their fries are extra but I got to try the garlic Parmesan and the blue cheese fries. The fries were just ok. They are hand cut and double fried but I kind of found them overdone. The onion straws though (they topped the blue cheese fries) were delicious. The next time I visit (there will certainly be a next time) I might just bypass the fries and see if I can get a side of onion straws. The space is really cool, very casual but small. I would guess the place seats about 20 and luckily for our group of 3 and a half there were seats aplenty. The flat-screen was showcasing music videos and the decor is rock n roll legend inspired."
"Awesome burger. My girlfriend and I shared the Salty dog, which requires a front-end loader to eat, and the Amazing Grace, which we inhaled. The atmosphere is totally unpretentious with a nice soundtrack of classic rock and grunge (all the folks that made money on Leadbelly's genius). The taps are weak, but the bottles are exhaustive and delicious. The space is small, not made for lingering, but we definitely didn't feel rushed. We ordered fries, but after the burgers, couldn't eat more than the complimentary cookie."
"Always a solid Friday night meal option. Garlic fries, Chipotle fries, and plain fries are great and never soggy. Portabello mushroom gallows pole is my go-to, though I've had 3 other burgers on their menu and they are always consistently great. Because it's a small place I usually order take-out, but I highly suggest eating-in sometime and soaking up the rock n roll ambiance. Great beer selection too!"
"I've had leadbelly bookmarked for a while now... Finally made my way over there tonight. The woman at the counter was sweet and informative. The staff was all curious if all patrons were happy. We enjoyed both burgers and fries. I had the lead belly with cheese and my husband had the one that comes with bbq sauce and bacon. Quite peppery, with a kick. I definitely felt like I was full after, I barely had room for the tasty cookie!"
"The place is pretty cool with their rock n roll theme burger joint and a brunch of crafty beers as well. I had the raising sun burger with a fried egg, bacon and cheddar cheese which is really good. I had their fries with olive oil, garlic and Parmesan cheese but wasn't to impressed with those. They also give you a fresh butter cookie. Overall pretty good but as I always check out places with great burgers, they fall into 4th place with me. Au Chavel hands down my #1 burger spot, a MUST go to place!"
Have only been here once and ordered the Black Betty along with the garlic parm fries. Yummy in my tummy! This place rocks.
"I am not sure if it was because I was starving when I got there and then waited for an hour or because I had tried to go another time and they were closed... or because it was new or because the flavors just hit the spot but I am fairly certain that this is the best hamburger I've ever had.  And the parm, / truffle fries (or whatever they were) were by far the best parm/truffle fries I have ever eaten."
"Leadbelly is a small burger joint that has an old school rock and roll vibe to it.  They offer an array of craft beers, shakes, loaded fries, and unique burgers.  When people say the dining area is small, it's SMALL!! It only offers counter seating and about six tables.  But for those warmer days, they open up their outside patio.For food, I ordered the leadbelly burger (lettuce, tomatoes, onions, siracha pickles, and your choice of cheese) with a side of belly fries (pork belly, onion straws, and sweet mustard.)  Yea I wasn't feeling too adventurous with my burger this time, but I found the patty to be semi-overcooked.  They did not bother to ask how I would like my meat cooked, which most other burger places do.  Not all people like well done Leadbelly!!  Other than the semi-overcooked meat, everything about the burger was good.  Their homemade bun was delicious and the siracha pickles gave it an extra kick.  This made the burger alright I guess.  I wasn't a big fan of the belly fries even though other people raved about them.  I just thought the chunks of pork were too big for my liking.  Oh, did I mention they give you a butter cookie on the side with your burger.  Nice touch Leadbelly.Overall, the burgers here were alright.  I just had better burgers in the Chicagoland area.  I would not go out of my way to eat here, but if I'm in the area I might consider it.  I also feel like the seating area was too tight.  You have to snake your way through to your table and probably still bump into other people."
"I checked this pace out during the Yelp Burger Bonanza a few weeks ago. My friend picked it out and I'm so glad she did! It was a quite a hike over to the restaurant but we thought, ""for $5 burgers and alcoholic milkshakes, it will be worth it"". We were right!I ordered the pumpkin alcoholic shake because I can't resist anything with pumpkin  flavoring. It's my favorite and it was so sweet and delicious. The $5 burger special was the Old Time Religion burger with roasted tomato, goat cheese, arugula, and truffle aioli. The burgers are served on homemade buns and when the buns are gone, they close! Everything about the burger was amazing. They tasted great, the cheese and aioli tasted amazing together, and I didn't leave a single bite left.They also give you a sugar cookie in a little bag to take home (thank God, because I definitely couldn't eat it after all that food!) The only things I wasn't 5-star thrilled about were the parmesan fries. I just prefer my fries a little crispier and there was a LOT of parmesan on top so it was a bit overwhelming. We also managed to find a spot to sit pretty much right away but there is limited seating so it might be hard to eat there if you go at a busy time. Just a heads up!All in all, though, this was an excellent choice to visit during the burger bonanza and I would love to go back when I want to try something a bit more unusual (which happens pretty often)."
"If the Old Time Religion burger is indeed a religion, Catholicism can kiss me goodbye.  Made with their homemade bun (they should bag these and sell them!), goat cheese, arugula, tomato, and truffle aioli, it's taken the top spot for my favorite burger in the city.  Sorry, Kuma's.Leadbelly also sells alcoholic milkshakes.  I had the ""Medicine Man"" milkshake with vodka, coffee liquer, and chocolate ice cream.  For $8, it might appear to be an expensive milkshake, but you are getting an alcoholic treat too.  The parmesan garlic and bleu cheese fries are so good!  Fries do not come with burgers, but you can order them separately for $2-4 depending on what kind you want.  They are fresh cut and fried in peanut oil to perfection.It was about $46 for us both to have massive meals (two burgers, two orders of fries, and two adult milkshakes).  Two burgers and drinks would cost substantially less, and the fry portions are shareable. A jolly man I'll assume is the owner was very welcoming and checked on all of the tables throughout the time we were there.  He was very enthusiastic about explaining the menu to us as well.Leadbelly's decor and theme seems familiar.  There are rock posters on the walls, and the giant TV shows rock concerts.  I think we were watching the Rolling Stones while we were there (sorry, I'm not a classic rock fan).  Kurt Cobain, Johnny Cash, and Mick Jagger are all going to watch you while you eat!  They did the rock thing well, the consistency with the frames (black) and photos (all black & white), gives the place edge but keeps it clean and classy looking.  Actually, this is the cleanest burger place I've ever seen!  The tables, floors, bathroom, all was sparkling.  There are six tables in here, and a bar with 6-8 seats, and they were full when we sat down to eat.  They could definitely benefit from more seating but they are using all of the space they have.Portage Park is a one-hour drive from home for me, but it was well worth it, and I will definitely go back!"
"Went into this place with some seriously high expectations and let me tell you, party in my MOUTH people! We got our shakes early on and I couldn't help sucking down my vanilla delight like a vacuum stuck on HIGH.Every burger we had (we each for something different) was outstanding and the garlic parm fries made me tear up they were so delicious. Pros: best burgers I've ever had. Milkshakes were authentic and delicious. Fun Trivia cards at table kept us busy while waiting. Cons: LOUD music (I'm not a fan of concert like screaming). Butter cookie was thin and kind of stale. Biggest disappointment. Small indoor seating."
It was a good burger. I enjoyed it.
"Nice little selection fo beers.some nice ales,my favorite is the peach county,yummo.food was good.the selection of burgers all sound great,hard to choose from about 10-12 burgers.nice selection of fries and outside seating sealed the deal.will be back soon."
"First time coming here and there is an ACDC concert playing on 4 tvs, big burgers and nice selection of beer. I like this place!"
"Burgers. Spiked shakes. Craft beer. I'm sold.I was surprised at the size of Leadbelly (it was smaller than I thought), but it didn't phase me. I loved the rock n' roll decor and the live concerts playing on their big screen TVs.I enjoy bleu cheese so I naturally went for the Black Betty and Bleu cheese fries. I loved them both. They employ their own delicious bread and hand make their own patties so you can taste the freshness. Also, what better way to wash down your burger than chugging on a craft beer?  My choice was Gumballhead from the Three Floyds Brewery. It was a match made in heaven.Everyone was great. I also loved the condiment stand that housed all sorts of hot sauces, ketchups, and other sauces. Great touch.Give Leadbelly a try, you'll enjoy it. Cheers."
"Best burger I ever had, if you don't go to LEADBELLY you are missing out !!  The best burger in Chicago period !!!Cool Rock and Roll theme and they serve a huge variety of beer and spiked milkshakes. Love the fresh cut fry selections and the Rock and roll song names they give the burgers . You won't leave hungry the burgers are huge, fresh , and cooked to perfection and the buns are amazing. Great burgers and great music !!"
"a vegi walks into a burger bar......and comes out super pleased!  even most of the fry options were not vegi friendly!as a vegi, i tolerate the standard vegetarian burger substitute, the portobello mushroom.  dress it up with loads of condiments and the ruffage and its a passable meal. although LB is obviously known for their beef, any burger could be swapped for grilled chicken or portobello.  i opted to have my portobello gallows style (without the smashed taters) which included even more [grilled] mushrooms, onions, swiss and bernaise.  it was honestly the tastiest mushroom i've ever had - very well marinaded (in balsamic and spices) and cooked just enough so that the 'shroom was just a bit crisp.  the garlic parm fries were heavenly but wished they were cut thinner (a la mickey d's).  our party of 12 passed around a selection of fries (including pork belly topped, onion ring garnished and polish sausage accompanied!) and we tried hard to cover the burger menu but the favorites were the amazing grace and easy rider (featuring the infamous 'bacon').  if the meaty toppings weren't enough, there is a wall-o-condiments including a variety of mustards and hot sauces and of course, a bar stocked with colorful bottles of beers offering a ton of microbrews.  you get a much talked about but not very tasty butter cookie with every meal.  next time, i'd like to try a spiked shake ;)it's a tiny place so we were thrilled that we were able to find seating for all of us.  you order at the bar and grab a number.  i pulled down a star for the passive service...be prepared to be met by half shut eyes on the other side of the bar and slower than average service."
"Yum, Yum, Yum! Litteraly a diamond in the rough...the burgers 7oz all the scrumptious toppings you can get. The condiments are ridiculous and I get dizzy thinking of how many. My burger was complete with the awesome garlic fries. I am not a beer drinker so had 2 beer/applecider concoctions.  They hit the spot. All in all you gotta check this place out and ask for Myah, SHE'S AWESOME!!!"
"Awesome burgers, decent beer selection, laid back atmosphere, front patio area for those nicer days.  I think burgers are just as good as some of those other burger joints  that have long wait times."
"Eh, it's ok.Not a huge fan like everyone else seems to be.I do like the sausage beef burgers but kumas corner even with waiting outside for an hour is far superior. All in all not awful I just wasn't blown away."
Finally tried this place on Valentines Day. We were the first ones to walk in and thank God because after about five minutes the place was packed! The waitstaff is very friendly and that always makes my dining experience better. I had the lead belly burger and the fries with pork belly. The burger was very tasty and I would definitely come back for another one. The pickles on the burger were delicious! The pork belly fries were not so great. I recommend the garlic and Parmesan fries. Fries aren't the best but not the worse. My hubby had a strawberry shake and he didn't like it very much. We live down the street so we will probably visit again in the summer. The music was annoying and a bit loud but I can see past that.
O EM G!! BEST GF BURGERS I'VE EVER HAD. :) I go once a week!!The manager/boss is incredibly patient and caring. He went through the whole menu with us and he multitasked between us and other customers ahead of us. Recommended a few beers- so yeah I took one :) Irving park has now changed since this new spot opened.  Crazy loviin it. Wooo LEADBELLY!! U ROCK.
"Leadbelly is delicious!!!  I have been meaning to make the trek to Portage Park  since they opened.  I finally did and it was definitely worth it.  The burgers are some of the best in the city, the fries are fantastic, and I'm still sad that I didn't order more than one spiked milkshake.  I guess I'll just have to go back real soon!  We also really enjoyed the small sidewalk seating area that they have out front, and the employees were helpful and friendly."
"Delicious burgers! My friend just moved into the area and we wanted burgers for dinner, so we decided to give this place a shot from all the good reviews. I thought it would be more barlike but it was even more low key than that. Seating is a bit cramped, but because you seat yourself and it takes a while for people to get their food the wait time for an table wasn't too bad."
"I loved my experience at Leadbelly from start to finish. When we walked in we granted table & examined the menu on the TV. It was really nice way to see it displayed. The Black Betty was my burger of choice & I was extremely pleased with that decision! I also had the Garlic Parmesan fries, so delicious! The main reason I came in to Leadbelly, was because I heard that their buns were homemade, daily & when they're sold out they close the doors. So, I made it a point to get there early. Another reason I decided to give them a try, was the allure of their Adult Shakes. I've never had such a delicious buzz in my life! My dinner companions were also very pleased with their menu choices. We plan to return again and again!"
"The burger are amazing! Ordered for pick up on a Saturday,  the food was prompt and delicious. It was packed nicely and the service was great. Also the fries selection isn't too shabby either.Only reason it's getting 3 stars is because they forgot to pack the drinks I ordered and I didn't realize until I got home. Def will have to dine in and try the beer."
"The food is so good, I went back three days in a row for dinner! I live about 2 blocks away, so I'm going to have to ban them for now, or I won't be able to fit in the door.The burgers are massive. I had The Gallows Pole and two Black Betty's, also the Garlic parmesan fries, the Chipotle fries, and Bleu cheese fries.The Gallows Pole: I ordered it well done, and it was. It was extremely messy, and I felt it had too many onions and mushrooms on it, had to knock some off and eat separately. The smashed taters on top looked like plain French fries to me. The Béarnaise sauce must have been invisible, because I didn't see any. Overall, I would give this burger a B+.Black Betty: One of the 2 I had was not quite well done like I requested. The first one was also smaller with less toppings. The second one was huge! It had a hearty serving of bacon, cheese, fried onions, and buffalo sauce. Very spicy and delicious. I give it an A+.The garlic parmesan fries: I liked these the best. Mine had that invisible parmesan cheese, but the garlic was prominent, and I LOVE garlic. A-Chipotle fries: Eh, I liked them, but would not get them again. The bottom fries were dry. C+Bleu cheese fries: Tasty and spicy and tangy. AThe complimentary cookies were paltry, but tasted good.My mother had the Amazing Grace burger. She said it was too big. I tasted a piece, and I liked the sauce on there. I was expecting yellow colored mustard, but it looked like barbecue sauce. The onions straws on there were amazing.She also had the Polish fries, which I did not taste, but she said they were good.My sister had the Easy rider. She liked it. She thought the bun was too buttery.My only gripe: We ordered all our food for carryout. The first time my mother went in there, it was only about 4:30PM, they open at 5PM, but you can sit in there and wait. The lady at the counter never told my mother she could place her order, just told her to have a seat.Some more people came in at about 4:50PM, and the lady was about to start taking THEIR order, when clearly my mother had been sitting there as told by her for twenty minutes.She went up to the counter, and the guy up there started taking HER order, since he knew she was there first.I don't know why that happened, but it was annoying. It didn't happen the other two times, because she arrived after 5PM.Side note: I ate here three times, and developed diarrhea after all three times. Normally, I wouldn't mention something like that, but I find it interesting, due to the fact that my mother had 1 burger, and also developed the same problem afterwards, and my sister had the 1 burger, and ALSO suffered afterwards. We did not have the same food as stated above, and some were eaten on different days.I am still currently in a bad way, after yesterday's partaking."
"One of the best burger places I've ever been to, especially if you factor in all the little things that make it great in addition to the excellent burgers. Good beer selection, very friendly staff, a unique music-oriented concept for a small restaurant, and all topped off with a complimentary sugar cookie. Oh, and did I mention that the burgers were excellent? Seriously, among the best I've ever had. Homemade, fresh patties with locally sourced beef mixed with pork belly and a variety of interesting burgers on the menu. Would absolutely go back."
"I went on Memorial Day around 5:00 PM and it was empty. Ordered the Salty Dog, garlic parmesan fries, and a bottle of Ebel's Weiss (Two Brothers). Everything was incredible. Hamburger buns are made in-house and they are world-class. (They have a sign warning that when they run out of buns, they close up shop.)My only complaint is that it's so far away from where I live, and there's no easy way to get there. Admittedly that's more my problem than theirs, though."
"I went here on a fri night at 9:45pm and was informed that I would have to take my order to go as they were about to close at 10pm. I watched them turn away 3 parties totaling 10 people in the 10 min it took to make my food, this ain't Mayberry its Chicago why are you closing so early? I would give this place a lower star rating but they earned some redemption with food quality. Not the best I have ever had but none the less pretty good. Would have been better at a table with some craft beer though.....hint hint. Burger run you about $10 which is the standard for a place like this. May or may not return..."
"Leadbelly is a very spiffy little joint. It's not too big, and probably not good for groups of more than four ,but it's really an inviting and visually pleasing space. While they serve beer and wine, there is no bar. But you are greeted when you arrive by a friendly chap,  who instructs you on the protocol as well as your newbie status if he doesn't recognize you as a regular. He points to the nice big video screens which display your menu choices. You place an order at the counter, pay the man, and sit down to wait for your burger to arrive. Preferably with a nice craft beer choice for starters.I chose the burger with tomato, goat cheese, and aioli, the regular fries and a Founders IPA to wash it all down. There is outdoor seating here, too, which was good, since the main room was full. My burger arrived in 15 minutes or so with a gal and a big smile. The burger is a modest size, maybe 6 ounces or so. done to about warm pink inside with a locally-sourced beef. It was fresh and more on the dry side. But the combination of condiments and the crisp/soft bun was perfect. The fries were excellent, too. Two people could share one order. Total for food and drink: $18.00.The best thing about Leadbelly is it is a unique burger spot. The menu has about ten burger choices and some fun fry concoctions, too. The Polish one sounds like a meal in itself. I will need to try their other more exotic offerings like the burger with a crab cake on top. With service so sweet and friendly, it would be a shame not to come back . Great spot for a pre-theater bite if you are going to a show at The Patio Theater. It''s only about four blocks away. Also, it's nestled between a martini bar, in case you need a cocktail, and a fun little second hand shop. Feeding my Portage Park love one place at a time."
"Even tho I my order had to be to go since we arrived 6:59pm just before they closed.. They took our order and ate it at home! Wow! Awesome!!!! I usually hate to order to go for places using wrap ur burger bad... But not lead belly!!! They are off the hook!!! Great packaging and wow!!! So so good! I ordered the rising sun burger with the chipotle fries and chocolate shake... Wow crazy mix.. But have to say, tasted awesome!"
"My quest for the best burgers in the city inevitably landed me here...The atmosphere is super laid back. You can sit at the counter next to the window or at a table with a wall of TVs in front of you, typically playing a concert DVD.The burgers are competent. A good sized patty cooked to your preferences on fresh baked buns. Some of the burgers come dangerously close of falling into the Kuma's trap of drowning out the flavor of the meat with excessive toppings, sauce, and cheese, like the Black Betty. I recommend the Old Time Religion, topped with roasted tomatoes, arugula, goat cheese, and truffle aioli.Not a typical fan of fries, but they're done well here. Hand-cut and double fried, they come out tasty and with a variety of toppings, like onion strings, pork belly, and bleu cheese. It's a better idea to take the toppings you would have put on your burger and roll them over to your fries.There's a great selection of craft beers as well. I had a cranberry hard cider that complemented my Old Time Religion and Belly Fries perfectly. If you can't decide, there's a flight available for $6.50.The milkshakes topped off what was a perfect meal. For $5, you get an ACTUAL milkshake, made with real ice cream and milk, so thick you need a spoon. They say they come with a ""world famous"" sugar cookie, laced with vanilla and chocolate frosting, but mine didn't come with one. When I asked about it, the owner was nice enough to give me two to make up for her oversight. Now THAT'S customer service.All this rang up to $25 bucks. A pretty solid deal for a burger aficionado like me. Will definitely be back."
"Quality burgers, both modern and classic toppings. Reasonably priced craft beer to boot. The Old Time Religion burger is phenomenal. Fries are good. Expect long lines and waiting outdoors if you go during normal eating hours. Limited seating. Definitely a must if you call yourself a connoisseur."
The burgers are pretty good. I'm super excited for places like these around the area. Not as good of burgers as The Lock down or Kumas but still pretty good. I ordered it medium but it ended up being medium well with some burnt taste on the outside... but I like my meat with some pink. Should've ordered medium rare. But good place
"Went there based on a recommendation from a co-worker.  I wasn't disappointed.  The service (and the management) is very good in my opinion.  My burger seemed slightly undercooked (I asked for medium well) and the manager was not at all rude and very courteous about it.  Said that they use pork meat (mixed with regular ground beef) and because of that, it can cause the color to appear pinkish.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed my burger and I would go back sometime to try the other ones on the menu.  Also their butter cookies are homemade and really tasty.  The manager gave me a whole bunch of them for free.  Really a nice lady."
burgers are fantastic. Fries are actual potatoes. Shakes and selection of beer are awesome. I got the leadbelly well done and house fries. Wife got the easy rider. Youll find something you like here. Prices are decent for the amount of food you get. Parking is ok. Only negative i can think of are hours and the seating area. We planned on eating there but there was literally nothing open. So we stood by the bathroom until our order was ready. Not the best place to stand when you have people eating half a pound of beef. Order took about 25 min.
I read the reviews for this place and wanted to try it out right away. We ordered the Easy Rider and the Old Time Religion burgers and Garlic Parmesan and the Belly Fries. The burgers were very delicious. Their buns are homemade and taste very buttery. Their Belly Fries are a must-have. Their burgers come with their home-made cookie as well which we had to take home because we were so full from the meal we had. We will be coming back to try their other items.
Good burger and beer joint with a bit of classic rock ambiance. Wait time can be a little long but they play good music there so gets beer and chillax
They had a about 10 different burgers to chose from and about six different fries to chose from. I really didn't see the different from any other burger joint. They had a lot of different beers. I'm not a beer drinker so that didn't impress me at out. It's a really small place they got about 7 tables on the inside. I think I decided to come here because it had outdoor sitting which made it a plus. The waitress and the young lady doing the cooking were really nice. If I had a taste for a burger I will come back. Next time I'm going to try shake
"Great location, great customer service and food is pretty good. I ordered special $5 yelp deal burger with goat cheese and I must say that this was the best version of this type of burger. Great selection of drinks. They have fancy cream soda, orange drink etc. as well as large selection of beer and milkshakes even once with the alcohol. Only suggestion I would put shaved Parmesan on my fries. Next time I will try chilly fries. Did I mention great service? Very inviting. Great find. I will be back.PS: Bun is homemade!!! Toasted with a sesame seeds on top!!!! Yeah! This is what I am talking about!!!! Never change that please!"
"Went out on Friday night, figured we needed a burger and a beer. Got just that and more! Walked into Leadbelly and was taken back in time - Led Zepplin was playing and the music was rocking! Went to sign up for the sit down list, got a couple of beers and placed our order. Sat down for a few minutes enjoying the ambiance - didn't even finish our beer and we were seated. Food arrived within two minutes! Burgers were great, brew was cold and the music was classic! Thanks for the lime! A definite go to joint!"
I was walking down the street and ran into this place ... guy was setting up outside and I asked him ... you work and eat here ? ... said oh yeah ... so I went inside I got the Easy Rider and some Reg fries ... I have to admit this was by far one of The Best Burgers I've HAD in a while ... great friendly staff awesome inside and also patio ... Thanks for the good time and food !
Awesome place.  I say this somewhat abashed as I am a vegan work in progress and this is pretty much the furthest opposite you can get from that (even with with the vegitarian options)...I went all out for this special occasion (family visiting from out of town) and we were all super pleased with out the quality of the food (even the buns which are all freshly made) and the service which was very nice and helpful.  Awesome time had by all.  The best burgers I have had and second best fries I have had...It is a really small place like everyone else says so be prepared and maybe try to order ahead...Though tables usually open up pretty quick...
Loveeeeee their burgers! Love the freshness and thickness. The atmosphere is great in there. My new burger joint. :) nothing negative to say here people!
This place blew me away. I love kumas and lockdown but this place is just as good if not better. I went last night with some friends. I got the goat cheese arugala and roasted tomato w/ truffle aioli. Holy moley!!   The burger was seasoned and cooked perfectly. I got the gluten free bun which was surprisingly awesome. I Will be returning!!
"Good burgers, a little pricey, but a really good selection of drinks and sodas, some of which I have never heard of before! They are a little stingy on the fries but they do give you a cookie at the end of your meal, which is kind of sweet! Be aware, this place is really, really tiny and the TVs are loud! Maybe dont take someone you want to have a serious and intimate conversation with but, still its a nice little joint."
"My brother and I went to Leadbelly a few months ago, but I never wrote a review for it. When I read that someone said this place was better than Kuma's Corner, I knew I had to go. It was really busy and my brother and I had no seats so we stood up by the table in the back by the window while we ate. Also, a 40 minute wait for the food as well, but was absolutely worth it. They have a good beer selection and good service. I ordered the black Betty burger and Bleu cheese fry. Amazing. I'm going to be honest and say that I did like it better than Kuma's Corner (even tho it's one of my top 5 burger places). I have been meaning to go back and try another burger. Even if I don't have a seat again. I also loved the decor. I read that they are opening a second Location and that makes me happy."
"Came here a few months ago and it was so yummy! Small space but recently they have expanded to outdoor seating because of the weather. No matter what you order you'll be satisfied! Last night I ordered the Leadbelly burger to go, which is pretty much your burger with cheese, LTO. So good! Their burgers are made to perfection--that's the secret. Along with their friendly staff and cool ambiance. By the way my hubby is a vegetarian and orders their burgers with a large grilled mushroom with whatever fixings are in that burger. Ok onto the fries---we love their garlic parm fries! The chipotle fries are excellent too. I have nothing but love for this local gem!! Can't wait to go back!"
"Great burgers, and I love that you get a little cookie with each order.  I love the different varieties of fries.  Service is excellent.  It is small, so it is probably best to order out."
Really good food. Love the house of the rising sun and Parmesan fries. I think it's better than kumas
"I got the Midnight Special which, though not exactly what I was expecting, was good.  The real star of the meal for me was the Belly Fries.  The Carolina Mustard BBQ sauce on them is so tasty.  I would definitely go again to try another burger and get those fries again.  I went with my parents and two sisters.  Both my parents got the Leadbelly and one sister got the Easy Rider while the other got the Amazing Grace.  Everyone enjoyed their burgers, but unless you like a soggy parmesan overwhelmed mess, I'd stay away from the Garlic Parmesan Fries.  My sister got them and they weren't worth the price.  That's the only complaint I could muster about the place, and that's about a side.  Overall awesome food and service was good and fast."
"Best burger I've had in Chicago all year! Really raised and set the bar for the city! Excellent job, and I can't wait to come back. Everything we all ordered was mouthwatering, and delicious."
"came on a sunday and orderedold time religionleadbellyhouse of rising sunamazing gracevery berry milk shakegarlic parm fryreally juicy delicious burgers! the fries were ok, the shake was awesome!"
"First time this weekend. The place is tight but that didn't not stop me from going 5 stars. I ordered the basic burger and was glad because what struck me was the flavor of the beef. The burger tasted fantastic, a clean beef taste. The bun was also exceptional, made in house. The fries again were real potatoes and made with skill. The friends we dined with had the parmesan fries and made me wish I ordered those instead of the plain sea salt fries.The staff was courteous and knowledgeable. Beer selection is a bit overwhelming.I'll be back, repeatedly!!!!!!"
I'm not much of a burger fan but omg this place is amazing. This is the neighborhood restaurant we take visiting friends and family. So many varieties of burgers--I won't go through them all but their fries are my favorite thing in the entire world. I love the garlic parmesan fries. They have a surprisingly excellent beer selection as well.The place is small but there's an outdoor seating area when the weather is nice.I really wish they had a black bean burger option though. :(
"Well, well my burger patrons,  Chicago has a new burger master in town.I went to Leadbelly at roughly 7pm on a Tuesday with two friends after a long day from work.  We were instantly greeted and explained the order process.  I was sold on the Black Betty and Chipotle fries with a Bottom Up to wash it down. Oh man, I was not disappointed by any means. The burger was cooked perfectly a medium rare with awesome flavors.  The Chipotle fries were delicious with the Chipotle sauce and tomatoes. Plus you get a little cookie at the end for desert drizzled with caramel and white chocolate with pecans. The beer choices were awesome!  Revolution brewery is a must for those of you that haven't tried any or Gumballhead from 3 Floyds is another good recommendation.  We will most def being going back."
"I'm not really a ""burger fan"" but this place is amazing! Decided to give it a try when a friend told me about their Tuesday special. Great food & Great Customer Service."
Amazing food!!! That burger was to die for! They have a great beer selection and their milkshakes are good. I didn't care for the fries but I'm not a big fry eater anyway.
"Definitely worth checking out!  The interior is amazing!  Decorated with all the best rock groups (the Beatles, nirvana, led zep, the who) and a wall of t.v.'s showing rock concerts.  I got the gallows pole burger and it was delicious.  Best to go on a week day, more crowded on a weekend."
"Great burger joint! Leadbelly was highly recommended so a couple of family members and myself decided to try it out. After having their Leadbelly burger, I will never see any other burger the same. It was perfectly seasoned, cooked just right and it was laid to rest on their delicious homemade buns. I was also old to try their Parmesan garlic fries and they were also a highlight of my meal. It's nice that they include a small cookie in your meal, just to top it off with something sweet. They have a great selection of craft beers! Although seating was VERY limited to begin with and would recommend sparing some time to snatch a table, this is a must go to place if you are looking for a quality meal in a great atmosphere."
"Gotta love them buns!!I absolutely live the buns at Leasbelly. They're incredibly soft with a nice toast at the end topped with a little sesame seeds. Yum! Caution as stated on the door once they run out, they're done for the day.Service is great and the burgers are really tasty. I had the black Betty and the one with goat cheese and arugula. I would have both again in a heartbeat.The fries are good but a little too salty for me. They also end up soggy in the container if you order for pick up.They have a great beer and cider collection mmmm and I think the prices are standard for this type of burger joint. Excited to have another great restaurant addition in Portage Park."
"Damn.  Another great addition to portage park. This place has 10 delicious burgers made from ground chuck and pork belly, or fried chk breast, or portobello. Try the House of Rising Son burger - incredible with fried egg, cheddar, home made siracha pickles, and bloody mary sauce.  Awesome selection of craft beers including Bells and 3 Floyd's. it's a party. Come check it out but be prepared to wait."
"Get here early!!! At 4:58pm today (Saturday) there was already over 10 people waiting to get in! The place is cute but very small, not too many seats which is a bummer!! The menu is on two flat screen TVs and is fairly simple to understand. I ordered the bleu cheese fries & the easy rider burger with lettuce! They both were amazing!!! The easy rider does have a good amount of BBQ sauce so be prepared for some messiness! I also decided on an order of rockin butter cookies which are a must try!!! So nice and moist!!! This place is more like 4.5 stars since the space makes it a little hard to get seating but I would definetly recommend everyone to try it! Deff will be going back. Also they give cans of coke products but it's free refills!! So don't be afraid to ask for another pop i didn't know that till we were ready to pay for anther drink"
"Great atmosphere and fantastic service. They have a really great craft beer selection and an outstanding soda collection as well. The roasted tomato and goat cheese dressed burger was great- ask them to add caramelized onions! Yum! I would give this place a 5 but the fries were too saturated in oil for my liking, but someone else might like that sort of thing! I highly recommend trying out the spiked shakes- amazing!Overall, great first impression and I will definitely be returning!"
"Ate here last week, Sept of 2014 and here's what I gotta say: Great service, unique burgers and great selection of drinks. Something tells me they could possibly be inspired by Kuma's but the fact that they celebrate daily with great music and award winning signature burgers shows me they have what it takes to back up what they boast on the menus. The cashier hosts the small dine in restaurant very well. The two menus (burgers vs sides) are very thorough and displayed on large television screens. The fact that all their burgers are made with pork belly and their own fresh baked bread is pretty awesome. Both of those combined gives great flavor to the food, which comes the way you order it. Overall it's a bit pricey, but well worth the time and money you pay for a filling and tasty meal. Do yourself a favor and get your burger medium-well at least (both pork and beef have high bacteria content that is sometimes unavoidable unless you cook it thoroughly). I had the signature mushroom burger (forgot the name) and chipotle fries and I'd do it again."
"Red meat and non-stop Journey videos? Five stars all the way.Gave Leadbelly a shot during Yelp Burger week, and couldn't have been happier.  I thoroughly enjoyed the Old Time Religion burger...so much so that despite other tasty-sounding burger options, I am getting that again next time. Even the buns are awesome...you know a bun is good when you are eating a burger and notice the dang bread. My DCs and I split an order of the fries with pork belly, onion straws, and mustard, and I recommend those as well. And I LOVED the butter cookies!! While I opted for pop to wash it all down, I have a feeling their milkshakes are something to behold. Leadbelly seems like the kind of place where being disappointed is hard to come by.I don't know if they show music videos all the time or not, but videos from the 80's will always put me in a good mood. And a special shout-out to the staff....one of my DCs was on crutches and when she hobbled in, happy Leadbelly people came to assist her to a table. It isn't a fancypants place at all....but great food in a friendly atmosphere is always a beautiful thing.I'll be back - the girl can't help it. (P.S. The next time you see Journey's Girl Can't Help It video, check out Randy Jackson. WOW.)"
"Stopped in this new local place with a friend whose co-worker told her about it.  I wasn't expecting much from it, but was quite pleasantly surprised.  I had the Black Betty... it was amazing.  Also got a side of Pico fries which were good as well.As others have mentioned, the space is a little small.  Luckily the weather was nice and we sat on the patio.  It still seems like they're figuring themselves out a bit... but I'm sure they'll be around for a while as their food is great."
"Awesome burger joint in the city.  Great service at the counter and busser is constantly flying round cleaning tables and checking in on occupied tables to make sure everyone's doing okay.  Atmosphere - chilled out/ low key.  Constantly have rock concerts in the background which is cool. Food - excellent.  I had the Salty Dog burger which was awesome with the Garlic Parm fries which were incredible.  My other two friends had the Amazing Grace and Gallows Pole - both of which received rave reviews as well.  And the cookie is a nice touch - sweet and salty.Beer selection was okay.  Selection consisted of 3 drafts and 20+ bottles/cans.Overall, this is a must. Even if you aren't near Portage Park."
"Nice addition to the Portage Park area.I really liked the atmosphere. It's a casual spot, with posters of rock icons (Dylan, Tom Waits, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin) lining every inch. The menu isn't huge: burgers, fries, and shakes, but to me, a menu focused on only a few items usually means they'll be executed well.Burgers are available in your choice of beef (which is actually a mix of chuck and smoked pork belly), chicken breast or portabello mushroom. They have many unique topping choices and combinations, and the price tops out at $9.95 (unless you're hungry enough to order the Titanic which is $26.95, but feeds 5!) Fry choices are interesting; garlic/parmesan, chipotle, bleu, even ones with diced pork belly or polish sausage.I ordered the Old Time Religion burger, which came with roasted tomatoes, arugula, goat cheese, and truffle aioli. I opted for the standard beef burger, and the pork belly added a smoky/salty component to it. I love goat cheese but had never had it on a burger before, and with all the other additions, I feared it would overpower the burger. Somehow it all worked. The bun too, was especially great.I also had the garlic-parmesan fries, which were very good; however, the parmesan on top would make much more sense if it was grated and not shaved. The chunks of cheese just kept falling off. The garlic flavor was subtle, but the pool of olive oil at the bottom of the basket of fries was a little unnerving and unappealing.Adult shakes are available and while I love a good boozy shake, I decided to stick with a traditional strawberry shake. It was excellent and I loved the bits of strawberry that clogged my straw. Obviously they use quality ingredients and it certainly showed. Craft beer selections abound for you beer drinkers.All burgers come with a gratis homemade butter cookie, which is a nice touch. Unfortunately I could eat it because it had nuts, but it looked delicious.I'll definitely be back. I'm thinking the Old Time Religion could be even better ordered with the portabello.Leadbelly is a great neighborhood spot for a casual dinner."
"Leadbelly really evolved since my first visit.  It was certainly not as busy as that time when  they just opened but appeared like they could handle a rush.  The interior has been refined and instead of a bus-station adjacent to the seating area, it is now a mustard bar with a variety of options.  Food was great! Called ahead for carry out and was ready as promised.  Leadbelly burger had a generous portion of goat cheese.  My wife ordered a Good Night Irene.  The crab cake was light on the crab as expected, but the rest of the fillings were perfect, especially the jalapeno.  Remoulade sauce was stand out as well.  The fries are enough to serve two, but how do you choose just one style?  Blue Cheese definitely beat out the Belly fries.  Carolina Mustard Sauce was a smooth barbecue that complimented the chucks of pork perfectly."
"One word to describe this place, the food and the service at BOTH locations...  supercalafragalisticexpialadoshus!!!  I love this place!  I had the Good Night Irene at both locations to see if there would be a difference and they served both burgers with the same consistency.  That's an A+ in the food industry and the thought of the taste of the burger is making my mouth water as I write this review!  Keep up the good work!"
"Leadbelly is a great addition to the quiet Portage Park neighborhood! Having recently returned to Chicago, I was introduced to Leadbelly during the hectic holidays, and I am now hooked on their burgers. As noted in other reviews, this is a very small establishment. There are a few tables along with long bar seating by the window. However, it has a rocking vibe to it with a massive tv playing various rock concerts (U2 was on tonight) with nice wall decor and fixtures. There were quite a lot of people waiting for take-out orders tonight, but the tables were packed with people. We were fortunate to have walked right in and had gotten a table. Ten minutes later, a few people were waiting for an open table. It can be hit-or-miss but we have been lucky the few times we have come in (during the never-ending snowstorms this winter). This is not a place where you sit down and order, unless you're grabbing a table...you have to order at the register and they give you a number (think Cosi or Corner Bakery). The cashiers have always been nice and informative, and ask if you have been in before.  There is booze available and while I have not tried the shakes, they do look very tasty. Next time. A server comes out with your food and occasionally checks in to see how things are going. What I like about eating there is that there's random trivia pursuit cards on the tables, so it's fun to quiz your friends and family while listening to good tunes.Now time for the burgers- The meat is marinated and seasoned with whatever they use and you can taste the flavors of it without the need for the condiments that get put on it. I like my burgers medium well and they do precisely that, there's just a hint of pinkness. Having tried the Black Betty, which is blue cheese, bacon, and onion strings with a buffalo sauce, I have found it to be a little overpowering. Tonight I had the Easy Rider, which is what I assume most people would consider to a cowboy/western burger, which had barbeque sauce, cheddar cheese, bacon and pickles on it (OMG, those pickles...if they ever sell those by the jar, I am buying some, because they are just fantastic). What a messy burger, but I had no problem biting into it and having my face smeared with sauce. YUM! And those buns. HEAVENLY! The fries are interesting here. We have ordered the parmesan and garlic fries and they weren't so hot. I like garlic, but these had more garlic than fries it seemed like. My friend liked them a lot, so to each their own. However, tonight we ordered the chipotle fries, and they were fantastic!!!! The chipotle sauce was very light and tasty and the pico de gallo was a nice addition. I expected the fries to be a bit soggy from it, but they were extremely crispy. I would definitely try those again. I also enjoy the butter cookie they serve with the burgers. It's light and just enough to finish off a savory burger with just a hint of sweetness. Keep the good vibes going (along with more U2), Leadbelly. I will be back when I need my burger fix again!"
"I was there for the grand opening on Saturday. The place is pretty small with only 6 tables (maybe four 4-tops and two 2-tops?) and bar-like seating along the restaurant front. When you walk in, there are a lot of pictures of classic rock artists, but interestingly I don't think I saw one of Lead Belly himself. There's also a bunch of TV screens showing classic rock music videos and classic rock was playing on the speakers (no Lead Belly here either). The setup is nice and intimate, and with the pictures, TV screens and craft beer display, my first impression was that this is exactly how I'd want my mancave to look if I had one.For the place being small, I thought that service was kinda slow but that just might be because we walked in an hour after it opened. Only half the tables and maybe a couple people sitting along the front were eating. To help pass time, they do have little trivia cards on the tables you can play with. From the time we ordered to the time we received our food, it was probably 25-30 minutes, but again it was probably because it was the grand opening.The food was pretty good. We ordered the Easy Rider (smoked bacon, more bacon, bourbon barbecue sauce and cheddar cheese) and the Amazing Grace (pork belly, onion straws, Carolina mustard). The burgers came out medium and were thick and moist. The fresh baked buns look heavy, but I thought it was just enough to keep the burger in tact the entire time without being too overpowering.About the sriracha pickle - I like sriracha so I thought this was interesting. It has a little bit of a spicy kick, but wasn't hot. I could see a lot of people throwing it away if they don't like pickles or aren't into spicy tough.Also ordered the Pico fries because I was curious about the Fritos chili cheese chips. They were good, but I don't think I'd order them or any of the other topped fry dishes again. I'm a crispy fry kind of guy and what happens when you put toppings on? They become soggy, so it kinda defeats the purpose of double frying your hand cut fries to make them crispy in the first place.Another thing I ordered was one of their spiked shakes - the Kansas City Papa (Bailey's Irish Cream, peppermint schnapps, and chocolate ice cream). Really good and tasty stuff, but for $8 it would probably be a special occasion order for me the next time. I didn't order a beer, but I was pretty impressed with the mostly local craft beer selection. A lot to choose from.The almost famous butter cookie - they included one with each burger. The cookie was melt in your mouth good and the sweetness from the chocolate and crunchiness from the crushed nuts was a nice touch. I could probably finish off the cookies in one sitting if I purchased the $9 jar.One final thing - when we walked in, there were a bunch of families with little kids sitting on their parent's laps. I have 2 kids myself, so before I went I asked if they had high chairs. The person on the phone said they did, but when we ordered the lady working the register said they didn't. We asked another woman (maybe the person that answered the phone) and she brought one out. So apparently they have at least one high chair, you just have to ask the right person to get it out for you (again, could've been a grand opening thing).In summary - I'm really excited about this place being in our area as it's definitely a welcome addition! When people think of a craft burger place, the first place they'd compare Leadbelly to would be Kuma's, but you really can't since Kuma's is on a totally different more over-the-top level. I see Leadbelly as a neighborhood burger joint similar to Bad Apple in Lincoln Square, but more on a truly local level. While I think the burgers at Bad Apple are better, Leadbelly represents what I think the Portage Park area is all about - a hard working, low key establishment where between the friendly staff and good food, you're definitely gonna get the most value for your buck. Definitely check it out!"
"Great burgers, awesome beer selection.Very friendly ownersGet there early, space is limited, and when they run out of buns, they close!Just made best new burger 2013 in Time Out Chicago too, well deserved"
"One of the best burgers I've had in years!  Went on a Tuesday so we were able to take advantage of the $2 draft pints - great deal.  I ordered the Midnight Special (chili cheese Fritos, pico de gallo, and chipotle cream sauce) and the garlic parm fries.  The fries were to die for!!!  No skimping on the garlic or the parmesan. My burger was delicious, and the perfect size: too often places give you enormous burgers to make up for the lack of quality, but these were just right.  Bun was soft and delicious, too.  We're going back in a few days - that's how good it was.The staff was very pleasant and helpful, and they bring the food to your table.  You'll need to seat yourself, though, and place your order at the counter. The place is small, so you may want to go at times to avoid a lunch or dinner rush, but these are small quibbles. Can't wait to go back!"
"Any place that sells delectable burgers, and plays vintage videos of Mr. Johnny Cash is an outstanding establishment.  I head the buzz about this place on the Yelpvine.  I decided to do an impromptu flyover and see what all the hullabaloo was about.First off this place is limited in capacity, but there is a lot more space with the outside patio open for the summer.  There was a rather burly gentleman sitting on a stool as I walked in. I figure he was  there for the crowd control.  I gazed adoringly at the menu and decided I would try the Black Betty.  This was a hamburger masterpiece.  The frizzled onions, the bleu cheese, the bacon, and the sauce was a harmonious blend of flavor I soon won't forget.They also hooked it up with some type of awesome buttery cookie, which I couldn't wait to eat.  This was also obnoxiously delicious.  I would really like to give this place five stars...I know I will very soon, the more burgers I try...the more I will fall in love.  It's amore!!!"
Love the meat on these burgers. Its about time something like this open in this area. Great place to chill have a drink and a burger before going out.
Great burgers on fantastic buns. Every order comes with cookie baked by the owner Yummm Don't miss ordering fries. Very different then you get at most places but so worth it.Their hours are a bit strange so make sure they are open before you venture out
"All burger patties are made with a blend of beef and PORK BELLY.First off, it DOES say on the sign that the patty includes Pork Belly, but it's in a smaller font, in parenthesis, after another word (beef) and really hard to see. (The board is all type and very overwhelming)I am sure the owners did not do that on purpose but my 5 friends and I never noticed. I was told by another friend who I recommended to go there after we did. (He doesn't eat Pork either).Couple ideas...Please let the customer know when they order that the burger does include Pork. (Majority burger places in the city sell all beef patties, so it is assumed)Add an all beef patty to the menu for the people who don't eat Pork. (Why turn all those customers away, even if it is not perfect I will eat it?)Portage Park is a working class neighborhood, you are not in Wicker or Logan. Why push away the local business? It comes off as pretentious and I doubt that is what you were going for."
"Go there and check the food!!!This is so far the best burger joint in the Irving Park Area, if not in whole North side of Chicago. They did absolutely the best meatless burger ever. The place is small but friendly. And yes, its family business, so you will meet the owner (amazing Lady), her husband and uncle with the stories behind the Leadbelly.There is also great entertainment.... A TV""S with the old school concerts of great musicians such as Peter Gabriel, Sting and Rolling Stones.Go there early cause they close the door when they run out of great buns."
"damn these burgers are so tasty. although i haven't been to every burger place in chicago , I'll go out on a limb to declare these the best.  i don't know the names of the ones i had there. last one was the BBQ bacon burger. omg. a perfect burger if there ever was one. definitely way better than that other place. you know , the hyped up one. leadbelly I'll be back. just a side note , both times I've been there they were playing Queen live. go just for that."
"A friend of mine posted a picture of his burger on Facebook Saturday night. I was  inside Leadbelly's doors by 1PM the next day! I ordered the special ""Anniversary Burger."" It was 2 Leadbelly patties separated by a mini Chicago deep dish pizza! I also asked them to add a fried egg. The employees were very kind and hospitable. This is now my favorite Chicagoland burger joint. There are also many craft beers to choose from."
Amazing food and music. The staff is fantastic too. I love the Old Time Religion burger. BEST food. Great staff. Good music!
"We love Leadbelly. So glad this little spot opened up because it's been a great addition to the neighborhood.Gigantic burgers piled high with creative and tasty toppings. Several types of fries to try. Nice beer selection. Boozy milkshakes. These are all good things. Small seating area, so there could be a wait, but it goes quickly. Have never starved waiting in line.My one wish is that they were open for lunch on other days besides Sunday. Have heard that a second location will be opening. Glad to hear it!"
"Maybe asking the customers how they want their burgers cooked will help this place.  All of the burgers came over cooked along with the heavy bun making them very difficult to masticate.  FOOD:  Burgers - Amazing Grace, House of Rising Sun, Easy Rider,                 Gallows Poled.  Fries - Belly Fries, Chipotle Fries, Garlic Parm FriesList of ingredients looked good on paper, but was poorly executed.  Too much BBQ sauce on the easy rider that overwhelmed the burger.  But even that was not able to mask the over cooked meat on the burger.  There was supposed to be smashed taters on the Gallows Pole, but we were not able to taste any of it.  The fries were probably the highlight of the meal.  The butter cookie that came with each of the burgers was also a nice touch.  I'm hoping it was an off night so I am willing to give it another try."
Just recently went here for the first time and all I can say is that I'm very impressed. My burger tasted great and fries were amazing. I had the agave wheat beer which turned out to be a great pick with my meal. Will be visiting again soon.
"Update:  changing to 5 stars because I've been there a few more times and even ordered take out and the food quality and service has been consistently outstanding.We had looked forward to trying this place since we heard it was coming to our new neighborhood.   We went on a Thursday night after a run.   First advice point: come hungry but not starving because, as it should be with any tasty weapon, There is a small waiting period.  Luckily I had read other reviews so we were forewarned about how small the dining area is with limited seating.   Everyone was cool about it today but Leadbelly will have to figure out a table system that is fair.  Otherwise once the warmer weather comes, hungry people won't be so patient and understanding.  Maybe a sign saying don't grab a seat until after you place your order?I hope that they can expand in size soon.   Without a true wait staff they are missing out on revenue from people ordering second or even third rounds while waiting for their food.  Perhaps they could somehow open a  Drinks Only section because most are not gonna get back in line no matter how good the craft beers are.   I would also work out an arrangement with Martini Club to use their seating in some manner.  The club doesn't get busy until Leadbelly is closed anyway.The food was delicious and we will be back.   Since it's close enough to walk to but not far enough to burn off all the calories, it will probably be a monthly treat instead of weekly."
"Want a kick-butt burger without the ridiculous wait and ear-splitting metal of Kuma's? Here. Come here. Homemade sesame seed buns (because, seriously, aren't we all a little sick of pretzel rolls?), tasty blend of both beef and pork, plentiful, seasonal toppings, locally sourced, greasy fries smothered in parmesan... and look! A seat for me and my family on a Friday night! How novel. How awesome."
Amazing burgers. Wish they had liquor and a wait staff. But have to say the burgers were amazing - equal to if not better than Kumas without the horrendous wait. Wish their hours were better - open for lunch??
"This is my favorite burger joint in the city.  Do like me, try their whole menu, and don't forget the sausage, so maybe it can be one of yours.  Don't forget to order a microbrew or 2."
"Oh Leadbelly, how do I love thee?After reading the reviews on Yelp, my fiancé and I passed this place a few times because it looked quiet and we were unsure if they were open. We stopped one evening on the way home and now it's hard for us to pass by without going there for dinner. Burgers, buns, fries, beer, homemade adult milkshakes, rock and roll, and some of the best service around. My go to is the Old Time Religion- whether you have a burger (I recommend medium rare because their beef is amazing), the ginormous portabella, or the freshly hand breaded chicken breast, there is no wrong here. My fiancé likes to try every sandwich on the menu and in our dozen visits, he's managed to mix it up every time. Unlike the famed Kuma's, you don't have to feel intimidated to alter your burger either. The chef/owner is usually in the back, making your burger what it is, and will be happy to help you mix/match your burger as needed. ***when LEADBELLY runs out of their freshly made buns, they close their doors, so get your burger while you can!***The fries, oh the fries.  They're hand cut in the restaurant and cooked, flavored, and served to perfection. I've never had to put ketchup on a single french fry there. While you're enjoying the music, or the featured music performance on the televisions in this burger joint, be sure to order one of their many craft beers and challenge your friends to some music trivia. Leadbelly is my favorite burger place and our only challenge is whether or not we keep this gem a secret or share with the city. We've decided to share because we live close enough that we will probably beat you there!"
"Black Betty and some Belly fries, it was as awesome as Kumas for me.  Small place, great beers on tap and bottle, expect to wait for a few extra minutes for the burger/table on a Saturday night.  Portage Park special restaurant, will be back."
I had a day off and decided to hit up Leadbelly. I've picked up from here many times but this was the first time I sat down and ate.  The Burger was even better and the fries were perfect.  The service was great and the atmosphere was like no other.  Where else could you eat a gourmet burger on a fresh baked bun while watching a Zeppelin show??  If your into great burgers and classic music this is the place!
"I've never heard of this place until I received a gift certificate from my brother-in-law to go here. Following my experience, I must say what a darn good gift!I'll start out with the ""Cons"": this place is tiny. It's not at all suitable for groups of more than 4, and even for groups of 3-4, seating is rare with an average 25 minute wait (but this is only if you choose to dine-in and we did come on a Saturday evening). My husband & I chose to sit at the bar by the window, but it was hard not to feel like you were invading the space of the family who sat at the table behind us. Also, I ordered a nonalcoholic shake (I'm not a drinker). Though the description surely sounded uniquely delish, once I tried it (Berry Shake), it was quite average. And now to the ""Pros"" (which made all the cons disappear)! Initially, I was disappointed in myself for not ordering any of the special fries because they all looked so scrumptious that I really had to try something- totally didn't. Dig this: good thing I didn't. I ordered the Old Time Religion ($8.95 that includes arugula, goat cheese, roasted tomato, and truffle aioli)- let the angels commence their singing here! Oh my God it was so good, I talked about it all night. There's full--- and then there's satisfied. I was satisfied! A great portion sized burger for a gal like me who enjoys eating. My husband ordered the Leadbelly ($6.95; his thing is, whenever visiting a place for the 1st time, always try their signature item). Whatever works for you babe! Both of our burgers were perfectly cooked to a medium, with a great sear on the buns. It's not a close driving distance to where we live, but we'd totally return no hesitation. Not to mention the sweet old man who was hosting/busing tables and helped us 1st time visitors and made it feel so homely there! Leadbelly is now a must-go-to place for Date Night!"
"Excellent. Great burgers--not stingy with the toppings, but not overloaded to the point of obscuring the quality beef inside. Excellent fries, enormous beer selection for such a small place. Friendly staff. Definitely on your list of must-visit Chicago burger places."
"To the people who are giving this place less than 3 stars - What's wrong with you?  Seriously.  Of course you'll have to wait a bit for your food - every sauce is made from scratch and everything on the menu is cooked to order (except the cookies) by an experienced chef - not by a kid flipping patties on a grill.Burgers were juicy and seasoned perfectly.  While I'm not typically a fan of fresh-cut fries (most places think that just chopping/frying is enough - it's not), the Belly Fries with the Carolina BBQ sauce were out of this world.I've been to Kuma's, this place has better burgers and fries (and I could hear myself think and hold a conversation)."
"Leadbelly is a little off the beaten path, but it's definitely worth the trek if you ever find yourself around Portage Park jonesin' for a delicious cheeseburger.Such was the case for my wife, my 9 month old daughter, and myself last Saturday evening.  We were driving around aimlessly trying to find a place to eat, when Leadbelly popped into my head (I had read about their grand opening a few months prior).  Being that it was 6:00, we figured we might have a shot at grabbing a table there, and lucky for us we did.  When we came in, there weren't any tables available, but fortunately a couple got up from their table just as we finished ordering so that was good timing.  My first impression of the place was that it was really small, but that it also had character.  It's definitely my style, as the space is decked out wall-to-wall with music memorabilia.  Lots of Nirvana, SRV, Johnny Cash, etc type of decor, which suits my tastes to a tee.  Also had a big screen TV blasting a Dave Matthews concert, which suited the vibe of the place.  I liked it.And as for the food and drink selections, well they definitely don't disappoint there either.  They only have 3 drafts to offer, but they also have a boatload of craft bottles available featuring all the usual suspects (Alpha King, Lagunitas, etc.).  Fine selection of brews.  And their burgers are probably 2nd only to the mighty Kumas.  I had the ""Easy Rider"" which was absolutely fantastic.  All I needed to see was ""more bacon"" in the description, and I was sold.  It was a really good burger, better than anything Bad Apple makes for example.  Not quite as decadent as some Kumas burgers, but the Easy Rider is awesome in it's own right.  And Leadbelly also had some creative options for fries, as I really enjoyed my garlic parm fries.  Very good.So all in all, this place gets 4 1/2 stars in my book for the great atmosphere, quality brew selection, and the very very good burgers and fries.  And not sure if it's a Portage Park thing or what, but this felt like a real place and was a refreshingly unpretentious dining experience."
Omfg...and a cookie!!!  This place is beyond good.  I think I may move in.
This is a MUST place to stop in for a VERY tasty burger AND homemade buns!
"Dang that was a good burger! Amazing good, great vibe. Save space in your stomach for this place... you'll want a spiked milkshake to finish! Try the Roberta!"
"pretty good coming here for the first time!I liked the ambiance in this place, very good to take kids as well; they have tv's posters and well maintained bathrooms, haha.Although, if you like your burgers well done, give them a heads up!"
We recently moved to Portage Park and Leadbelly was one of the first places we tried.  We love it!  I can see us coming more frequently as the weather becomes warmer this spring/summer.  The shakes looked amazing but we did not get to try them out.  It is something I am looking forward for next time.
"great tasty burgers and fries!  The adult milkshakes are delicious,  I love The Gallow's Pole and The Black Betty,  Give it a try!"
Great burger and fries.. Delishhhh!!
Wow the name is perfect this probably wasn't the best choice before a night of heavy drinking..... so full it's hard to consume beer too! The bbq burger was the best the one with mushrooms was our last favorite. Of the four we tried. The fried egg one was decent but the fiesta one was second best. Wow on the garlic parmesan fries. And complimentary cookies were a great bonus! The older male that served uswas so nice and helpful. Will definitely be back
"Absolutely love this place.  Music is awesome--sends me back in time--and the portabella mushroom burger--unbelievable.  Great to have an 'upscale' type burger place in the neighborhood so we don't have to travel down so far into the city all the time.  The only suggestion--wish they offered fresh jalepenos.  Oh--and fresh cut fries and fresh baked buns--seriously, you can't go wrong.  Great selection of craft beers too."
"Finally went to check out this place and.......I gotta say its delicious! It beats other burger joints I've been too in the city. Its just assembled deliciously and great friendly service. My husband and I had the easy rider burger, fantastic. Parmesan garlic fries and salt and pepper fries were good. Definitely recommend this place. Great selection of beers and great atmosphere. I will return and try other burgers on the menu."
"Best burger and fries in the city, and it's not even close.My brother-in-law and I made the trek out to Portage Park from Lincoln Park tonight in what remains one of the best collective decisions we've ever made. He had the Goodnight Irene, which is a crab cake on top of a burger (you read that right) and I went with the House of the Rising Sun. From the first until the final bite...no words to describe just how fantastic the burger was..The burgers on their own were worth the time it took to get out there, but that's without the garlic parmesan fries. Again, better than just about anything I've had in the city and that's saying something. Just the right amount of crunch and seasoning, with neither the garlic nor the parmesan overwhelming each other. Beer selection is rock solid, with Three Floyds and a number of other craft brews that will satisfy even the haughtiest beer snob on hand at a price point that won't make you cringe. We were able to have two burgers, two beers and an order of fries for under $50. Not bad at all.Atmosphere is chill, the dining area clean and the service is both efficient and friendly. Like Kuma's minus the attitude or hype. Chicago needs more places like Leadbelly, period. I'll be back."
Good burger and fries! I would go back again for more!!!!
Really good burger really good fries. Only complaint is I wish it was a little bigger inside
"This place is awesome , the atmosphere is sweet and the huge tv plays awesome music . The food is the best especially the. chipotle fries with pico de gallo must try"
"Go here for no frills, no gimmick, good burgers. They are big, filling and delicious. Get one of their signature burgers & feel free to add or remove items from it. Their Midnight Special & Easy Rider burgers were pretty good. I tried the Easy Rider w/ their breaded chicken breast & it was excellent. The chicken breast patty was huge. Try their fries. They're nice. Good variety in how they offer fries. Good beer selection. Reasonable prices & good service. 4 stars."
"I don't LOVE burgers but when I crave them  I wouldn't go anywhere else. Close to my place, laid back and friendly staff and very tasty. I couldn't finish mine because it was pretty big and the fries also filled me up. Next time burger only and share a fry. Yum! Yum!"
"OMG!!! We went here for a late lunch and everything was just AMAZINGLY PERFECT. The food, the drinks and the atmosphere couldn't get any better. What else can I say, don't miss this one folks. It's a keeper."
"We have been to Leadbelly twice now and we are already planning a third trip.  We must try ALL of the burgers.  The food here is delicious.  Best burgers we've had in the city, maybe anywhere.  The first time I had the Easy Rider with it's delicious bacony, bbq saucy goodness.  I didn't think it could get better than that.  Then I tasted my boyfriend's burger, The Gallow's Pole.  Unbelievable.  When we went back we BOTH got that one again.  We also took people with us who said it was the best restaurant they have eaten in all year. The burgers are a delicious blend of beef and pork.  Mouthwatering goodness. Next time I promise to try something different and I will also try an adult milkshake.  Some things to keep in mind, the place is tiny, so going during rush times might mean waiting for a table.  Also, an order of fries is pretty big and can be shared between 2 people.Finally, I give props to the awesome friendly staff.  Last time they forgot to give me the delicious sugar cookie they always include with your order, so they ended up giving us an extra one. They are always so nice and friendly!"
"Let me first say that I really wanted to love this place and it was a Very Nice Place with Great Service.  But in all honesty the burger was ok at best.  Don't know if I was just there on an off day, but the burger itself was overcooked and the meat quality just wasn't up to snuff.  I've had much better burgers at a lot of places around the city.  Not sure why this is getting 5 stars."
"Leadbelly's is a must stop.  All of the burgers look amazing, but i have only tried the ""Amazing Gracie"".  It is everything I want in a burger; tender pork belly layered on top of a perfectly cooked burger with onion straws, home made buns and a sweet and tangy Carolina BBQ sauce i could eat by the spoonful.  Yum. They also have a great selection of craft beers.  Always a plus.I can't wait to try all the other menu items."
"Really great burger, this is the first time I've been here and I got the Leadbelly burger. It was big, juicy and delicious. Their cookies are also really good. My friend got the vegetarian Leadbelly and he loves it as well, the substitute is a mushroom I believe. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try!"
"Awesome burgers and fries!   I usually have so much to say but to be honest, its really that simple."
"I love their creativity. I recently had the following at their Portage Park location: Good Night Irene which is a patty made of crab cake, pico de gallo, and spicy rémoulade, and although I am not a french fries fan, I get them every single time I come here. They are double-fried french fries sprinkled with sea salt and pepper, but you can also get your freak-on and try their fries with sauerkraut, Polish sausage, and horseradish mustard. If this doesn't cut it for you, try their fries with pork belly, onion straws, and Carolina mustard sauce. I love their homemade sriracha pickles. I am so happy that Nicole (she is the Owner) lost her job as a Chicago Public School Teacher, because she opened up Leadbelly with the help of her Chef husband. They now have a second location in the Gladstone area of the City on North Milwaukee Avenue. Whenever I am craving an excellent, high quality burger, I always get my freak on at Leadbelly. It totally satisfies me in every way!"
Great burgers have finally arrived in the neighborhood! I just wish they had more seating
"I like to consider myself somewhat of a hot dog and burger aficionado and could not be happier that Leadbelly is so close to home. The Black Betty is hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had. Don't even get me started on this places' buns. Homemade and so fresh. Have not been disappointed by anything I've ordered. Prices aren't cheap, but seem fair for what you get. Dare I say better than Kuma's. There I said it and its true."
"Really, really enjoyed Leadbelly. Delicious burger, tasty fries, nice people and great presentation. I've read reviews comparing it to Kuma's. I think they match Kuma's on taste, quality and creativity. But I do find it to be a different texture of burger (a beef/pork blend). Delicious, well crafted and wonderful, just a completely different burger. So for me not interchangeable. But with Leadbelly within walking distance and their easy going atmosphere I think enjoying Leadbelly's  creations will happen on a more regular basis."
"I love how they have a rock theme music and decor. However, im a little disappointed that their beef burger has pork in it, bec I can't eat pork. So, even tho I'm a big beef burger gal, I was force to order the chicken burger which is still good but I was definitely craving for beef burger .!!! The fries is decent, but its not worth the rave . I will only stop by here if I'm craving for chicken burger which won't be anytime soon or want to entertain a rock fanatics."
"I wanted to like this place, I really did.  And the husband was fine with his burger (not a fan of the blue cheese fries)  Unfortunately, and maybe in response to a prior comment about over-cooking the meat, mine was way underdone.  And, because I had the burger with the pico de gallo and crab cake, the meat was essentially ""masked"" so that I did not realize I had eaten what was a combination of raw beef and raw pork belly until I had enough to make me ill several hours later.  The bonus to this raw surprise was the benefit of jalapenos in the mix to make the whole experience painful and miserable.  I have now learned to cut the thing in half, no matter what kind of mess it will make - and save myself agony later.The fries are a lot like Top Notch Beef Burger, with the skin-on, mushy largeness - but cooked in peanut oil instead of beef tallow, so the taste is different.  Not a fan as I like crispy fries.  Husband thought everything was way too concerned with being spicy, but thought the meat was juicy.Not sure I would be back for a $32 lunch that made me ill."
"My husband and I come here often when we're craving a good burger. Great beer selection, friendly staff. The owner came out to see how we were doing. Overall, always a nice experience."
It's official.  This place has ruined all other chocolate milk shakes for me.  I can't stop thinking about my next one.
Awesome burgers! Great service. Decent selection of drinks.  What more do you want?
"Burgers and fries done the right way and worth every penny!   We've eaten there at least 5 times since they opened and it gets better every time.  Average price for burger, fries, and a drink will be about $15 and will stuff your belly for hours.  (You can easily spend that at McDonald's for complete crap).  All their meat is ground fresh, the buns are handmade each day, all the sauces are homemade recipes, and you get a free homemade cookie.  They also have an amazing selection of craft beers and fancy root beers/cream sodas.  The place is fun and decorated really cool with rock and roll memorabilia all over and concert DVD's playing on the big screen.The owners are super friendly and I'm very happy to support a local business.   And you gotta love the complaints from the vegetarians... WHY would you go to a burger joint if you don't eat meat???"
"So happy to finally see a great establishment on the NW side of Chicago.  Portage Park is an ""up-and-coming"" neigborhood (according to Chicago Magazine), and it finally has a burger and beer joint of its own to keep up with Logan Square and Wicker Park.  My wife and I ordered two different burgers and a single order of their pork belly fries.  We also had 2 beers that were on tap that were both fantastic.  You can tell that the owners really support the local community of Portage Park.  We had great service to go along with the great food, and we thoroughly enjoyed the live concert on the big screen.  We highly recommend this restaurant for people that live close by but it's also worth a drive for those of you further away.  We will definitely go back soon!"
The burgers were great! The bun is one of the best I have had and the beer menu is full of some local choices and national favorites as well.
"When you want a truly good burger, there are only a handful of places that are worth going to, and Leadbelly is high on that list.  The best way to describe the food: Deluxe!"
"Just moved about 15 mins away from Leadbelly. I've gone back a few times now and I really love it. No creepy stares anymore lol. Fries are always great, perfect burgers and great cookies. Even the vanilla shakes that I really didn't like at my first visit is growing on me. Will be back soon."
"Tried this place for the first time tonight. Ordered off of grub-hub for pick-up, who didn't call to let the restaurant know they had an order ( I have worked with grub-hub before myself, so I know they do this frequently). So I had to wait extra time once arriving. The owners, I believe, were great and got my food ready very quickly. We shared the chipotle fry with was amazing. I had the Good night Irene burger which was great! Had amazing flavor and great sauce. He had the Easy Rider burger, which I of course stole a few bites of. This was also outstanding. The butter cookies they give with each burger are something to die for. The customer service was something to go back for alone. The walls decorated with Pink Floyd, the Beatles, the Who, Johnny Cash, and many many others helped give the place a great atmosphere. They play old concerts on a large screen TV which gave the place a cool vibe to. They have a huge selection of craft beers and both regular and spiked milkshakes (cannot wait to try one of these)!!My only complaint was the burger patty itself. While it was great, and taste outstanding, I did notice uneven cooking. Half was well done, the other half was extremely pink. Also, should offer customers options of how they would like their meat done!Over all, a great place and very local for me. Good food and beyond outstanding customer service. I have already raved about it to several neighbors and will def be back soon!!"
Very good buegers! Lot of beers! Nice quite place. Little bit small. Not loud (music)! Tumb up ;)
"I've been dragging my feet over writing a review of this place simply because it's so small, and so crowded that the more people hear about it the worse it's going to be.  But to be fair I really liked this place.  I liked their burgers (Went with the basic burger as a benchmark, and partly because loads of toppings tend to be wasted on me.) and LOVED the buns.  The fries were tasty, but I had the belly fry with the Carolina-style sauce, and there was too much sauce on them.  I'd have preferred to be able to dip.  The shakes are very good.  I had a plain chocolate one but thanks to my dining companions I got to try all three of the day's boozy shakes, and they were really tasty.  And yes, the cookies are excellent.Leadbelly is a fun place, though a bit loud, and wicked small, with six tables and a long bar across the window.  Things move pretty quickly in the kitchen, but don't expect people to wolf down their food just so you can sit and eat before yours gets cold.  The staff is friendly and they work their butts off.The bottom line is that the place is too small for the kid of business they're going to be doing.  Since it's not far from our place, it'd be just as easy for us to pick up an order and take it home, but not everyone is going to want to do that.  All that aside, I have to say Leadbelly is just another sign that the Portage Park area is starting  to get some new life in it, and that can't be bad."
got my burger medium well done but it was way too pink!. Large burger with a lot of fries. Maybe I'll try a different burger next time. I know it's new down Irving park but that's pretty much it..maybe I'll give it another shot next time.
"My cousin and her boyfriend accompanied me to Leadbelly after I heard about the new addition to the area.The combo of the beef and smoked pork belly makes this burger patty hands down the best patty I've EVER tasted.  I ordered the Gallows Pole and an order of parmesan garlic fries.  The garlic was not overwhelming and I'm still dreaming about the burger.Beer here, beer here!  A hefty selection of local brews are available in bottle with a couple rotating on the taps as well.The only bad thing about Leadbelly is the size of the location.  Oh how I wish you were a bigger establishment!Thinking of going back next week and trying the Easy Rider or Midnight Special but one thing I do know is that I definitely will be back."
"Ohhhh Leadbelly.I almost wish I hadn't run 5 miles before going to grab a burger because my stomach was NOT feelin' it.My boyfriend decided to treat me to a burger after accomplishing the Cinco de Miler. I was so down for Leadbelly because I had passed it on the bus just one too many times.  I ordered the Black Betty, he ordered the Midnight Special, and a pico fry to split. It was all sssssoooo yummy. My dude always says the sign of a good burger is how messy it is and this is MESSY. Obviously in the best way. I could only finish half so I had the other half for lunch the next day and it was STILL good. To pass the time while waiting, we played rounds of trivial pursuit which they had on the table. That combined with Jim Morrison playing on the TV and the deliciousness of it all makes this a place I want NOBODY to know about, simply because I want it all to myself.Now I want a burger."
"Went opening weekend and was excited to see another ""hip"" place open up in the 'hood.I don't eat animals and was disappointed to see the only non-animal option is a portobello cap - *sigh* & *yawn*. There are so many better, tastier options out there. The owner is a chef, I'd love to see him experiment with an in-house made tempeh burger or black bean burger.The kitchen is SO big and the seating area is SO small. Not sure what can be done about it since the place used to be a pizza joint and I'm sure it came that way.I saw another reviewer point out the lost revenue from no table service. Central Kitchen has the same issue. I don't want to stand in line and pay again if I want another beer, or two. However, given the very limited seating I'm sure they don't want to encourage people to stick around. This place needs high turn-over to make money. Also, every time I think of going to Leadbelly I can't because they're closed. The few times that this has happened I've gone down the road to Sutherlands to give them my lunch & Monday business (aka $).I hope these guys can work out the kinks and get it together a bit better. Our area needs more options for date-nights and getting together with friends/family. I will definitely try them out again to see if there's been any improvement."
I've never given this many stars to a joint!  But this place surely deserves it.  The burger fad may have come and gone but those of who truly enjoy a good burger can appreciate this place.  I had the black Betty and was worried the blue cheese would over power it and I went sans sauce.  Neither the blue cheese or sans sauce did anything to diminish the flavor.  wow!  Oh black betty!  Velvety Milkshakes must be done after your meal if you have room.  The beer selection is quite a feat at this small joint.  Did I say they had liquor license!! I'm jealous Portage Park.
Went to the new Leadbellys on Milwaukee Ave and it was excellent.   It just opened one week ago.  Burger was great and so were the fries.
"Gourmet bur-gers,so good to me.Tell me wherecan you beatthis price?I was excited about this place the moment I heard it was opening up in my 'hood.  And I wasn't disappointed when I stepped through the doors last night. I figured Good Friday was the time to try out a burger joint since most people might be shying away from meat. But it warmed my heart to see other heathens such as myself waiting in line to stuff their faces full of cow. The place was full, and the line was steady. Leadbelly is smaller than I thought it would be, and I was really hoping they'd have a bar for folks who wanted to hang out for a couple drinks and R&R. But that's all right. There's always Sutherland's down the road.I wasn't feeling that adventurous, so I ordered the ""regular"" burger (Leadbelly), but it was delicious. The service was friendly, and the owner came around to ask if everything was good (it was excellent), and to thank us for our business. My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that it took a little long to order considering I was only third in line. It would have been a nightmare had the line been longer. But they're new, and they'll get it down. The food arrived promptly.I'll be back. In fact, I can't wait to go back. Thank goodness a gym just opened up less than half a mile away.Portage Park needed a place like this to make me feel cool. Gourmet burgers, craft beer, and rock and roll. I don't know about you, but that's the sexiest threesome I could imagine."
"The Easy Rider was a little light on its ""bacon...then more bacon"" promise, but the meat was great and the bun was fantastic.  The regular fries left a little to be desired, the Medicine Man shake wasn't as strong as it would have been with chocolate ice cream (they were out, but good news--they make chocolate shakes with chocolate ice cream, big points for effort), and my wife didn't love the Black Betty, which was a surprise.  But I'll be back to try again based on the strength of that Easy Rider...damn, that meat was good."
"OK, so I heard about this joint before I read about it which happened before I went to it. Crazy, right? Here's the deal on Leadbelly:The ambiance is a cross between rock-n-roll diner and burger emporium-meets-gastropub. Music is the theme; concert dvd's playing and the walls are littered with posters of rockers living (but mostly dead). The guys bathroom is ringed in quotes from famous musicians...I know this was a home-done project and bravo, really, but there IS a difference between you're and your. I'll leave it to the reader to spot itAs others have mentioned, it's tiny, but over all, it works. The Pale Ale selection (that is apparently  ALL craft beer IS now) is displayed prominently, which helps those without beer knowledge choose the label that looks the coolest to be drinking. Didn't try the adult shakes. The food...well...that's another matter.I cannot mock, poke fun at or even chide the food. We had the Easy Rider (chicken version) and the Rising Sun (standard) with regular and belly fries respectively, as well as the cookies and a Sprecher root beer.So: The Easy Rider smoked bacon   , more bacon,   homemade siracha pickles   cheddar cheese bourbon bbq sauce (in a chicken sandwich) was fan-damn-tastic. Juicy, crisp, smothered in smoky-delicious BBQ sauce with big bacon/pork pieces and lemme tell ya, it was more than enough to eat, even if you're hungry. The buns are very good, not heavy or overdone, but thick and robust enough to stand up to the assault of the sammiches and burgers.The Rising Sun burger was OUTSTANDING. Fried egg, cheddar cheese, bacon and a bloody mary sauce and a thoroughly delicious pickle. The scoop with their particular meat is that it's mostly beef with some pork. To that end, it needs to be cooked through. This breaks my heart a little. The best burgers are pink in the center and VERY juicy. Can't very well leave the pork half done though, so don't expect to get a rare or even medium rare burger. Still, don't let this dissuade you, the burgers are moist, tasty and in concert with the add-ons are closing in on gourmet If you're expecting a ""burger-oise"" experience, keep going. This place is not that $25.00 burger joint, this is that $10.00 burger joint with the $15.00 burgers and the $5.00 decor. A note on the service: There wasn't a lay-about in the bunch. Every person kept moving all the time. Even if it was just to talk to the customers, everyone stayed engaged and working. You WILL wait for your food, but it will be worth every second. Just sit down and relax...or stand, whatever. Oh, and I almost forgot...the butter cookies will change your f*@king life.Get some of those delicious bastards to take home, you might regret it, but who cares, you're rock and roll now."
"Burgers were very good.Fries were ok.Service needs help.  The line moved at a snails pace.  They screwed up our order, gave us the wrong order, but took us touching the food before we realized it.  They apologized to us - I'd have offered us something for our next visit.Speed up the line and work on making sure the orders are correct, and this would be a 4 or 5 star rating."
Burgers and fries are outstanding! I will be going back in the warmer months due to parking constraints and more seating outside.
"I really liked the decor and music.  I had the Rider burger, a berry shake and the Parmesan fries. The fries were GREAT and so was my shake. The burger was average BUT the bun was DELIGHTFUL (it was all buttery and YUMMY). Oh, the cookies were very good as well."
"My son and I had the Amazing Grace and Good Night Irene burgers, Belly fries, regular fries, and he had a Vanilla shake. The burgers are chuck and pork belly resulting in a great taste! The default preparation is Medium, which we both had. The Belly fries were to die for. At the bottom of the mini deep fry basket it got a little mush, but the top 80% were awesome. We also received butter cookies with each entree. I ate both of them when I got home. Screw the girl scouts, I want these! Finally, they have a HUGE selection of beer. Great place!!!"
"Excellent, excellent, excellent. Took my wife and two kids here for dinner tonight. Looks to be a family owned place, and the servers were very considerate, and helpful. Now the burgers are def up there and truly great. Fries are fresh cut fried in Peanut oil, very good. They have a condiment bar full of everything you could think of. Great place. Price is reasonable. oh and the homemade buns were actually very good."
"Best burgers in the City, plus they're reasonably priced.I had a House of the Rising Sun.  The egg on my burger was perfectly cooked, plus the sauce, cheese, and bacon were all excellent.  My girlfriend had the Amazing Grace, which was just phenomenal.  The burgers were moist, well-seasoned, and, best of all, didn't fall apart as we ate them.  The beer selection was also surprisingly good.We'll be back!"
"I loved it. I loved the food. I loved the atmosphere.  I loved the service. All and all I didn't think the wait was too bad at all. Its a small place and they are super busy. GREAT! Id much rather have to wait 20min for my food and have these guys be successful than lose a great place to go in the NW side. So about the food. My burger was flipping amazing. Cooked perfectly, juicy and fresh. LOADED with toppings. Seriously.  To die for. I also had an adult milk shake and that was no week drink! yum. The fries were good too! Although they could use a little more garlic imo but they were good as is too.I think a lot of these complaints from others are just normal growing pains of a new restaurant.  I cant wait to return!"
"2 house of the rising sun burgers with egg, one black Betty, one garlic Parmesan fries and blue cheese fries, nice little baskets (the baskets could be a little bigger), family owned, attentive staff and you can sense they need the tables so don't plan on lounging around. Posters of the Beatles and Led Zeppelin were cool. A little pricey and nothing left over to take home, which may imply that the fries serving size could be 33% bigger. Note: this restaurant as well as others like Burger Philosophy are taking fries to a whole new level, to the point where it's becoming the main highlight of the meal. Society has come a long way from McDonald's fries and our expectations will never be the same. Despite my minor critiques, this place certainly has the swagger."
"I finally had a chance to try Leadbelly.The people were really nice. I was asked if it was the first time, then was guided along.Inside it's almost like a bar/restaurant combo.Onto the food:I had the Leadbelly Burger. It was pretty good. The beef had good flavor and the toppings were good. Not the best tomato, but they are still out of season.I had the Parmesan Garlic Fries. They were strong flavored. Almost too much, but still very good.I also had a non-alcoholic shake. It was ok, I've had much better shakes elsewhere.This place is costly. Over $15 for the three items listed above. This will not be a regular place.I did have one issue. I took the shake to go, but was not given a cover. Of course I didn't even make it to the car without shake spilling over. Luckily the mess didn't make it into the car.I may go back, but the mere cost of things will probably hold me back."
Went here the other night with my son and seester and I made a great dinner choice. I had House of the Rising Sun and it was AMAZING!!! So good and definitely a must try. Who doesnt love fried eggs and bacon. My son had the Leadbelly burger which was good but too plain for me. My seester had the Old Time Religion but witht he portobello mushroom. Really good but would def taste better with meat. WE also had the garlic parm fries which I loved cuz I love me some crispy fries. For drinks had the Cherry Cola and its def the best Ive ever had. So yea you should go there and hope theres a table cuz its tiny.
"I am not an expert on burger but their easy rider is a satisfying burger for any meat lover. The wheat beer is also refreshing and goes well very with the burger. I did not enjoy their house fry but I will try other flavor next time, although I would say for lunch a burger and a beer is more than enough."
"Another great addition to the neighborhood.  Wife and I went in tonight and loved everything about it.  First, the burgers are on point.  As a chubby burger fiend, these were great -- homemade bun, fresh ingredients and great pickle.  Second, the service and hospitality is simply what you want from a place.  They stopped by several times to check in on us and took time to get to know us.  Finally, the prices are right -- especially when you get a butter cookie with your burger!Just what this strip of Portage Park needed.  Kudos LB!"
Amazing is the only word I can use to describe lead belly!  My husband and I each got a burger and cut them in half and had each others.  Both of the burgers we had were excellent.  We used to be big fans of Kumas but I think lead belly has stolen us away.  First off I get a great meal without having to wait in line for an hour!  I also like that its near my house.  Thank you lead belly for filling a void in my neighborhood!
"Welcome to the neighborhood!  I am blown away by this place. Great brew, great burgers, great everything.  Seating can be an issue, this would be the only complaint."
"Great food decor and service, went with my vegatarian cousin who loved the portabello burger.  Good beer selection, was crowded and busy, but the people working husled and got it done.  I will be back"
"So far I've not had a bad burger from this place.  My goal is to eventually try all of their burgers.  The place is only 4 blocks away from my house so my goal is attainable. If you go also try their fries with the different toppings. I will eventually try their adult shakes after hearing how good they are. The employees are incredibly nice and helpful. Their beer selection is also really good.  The only problem that we encounter is that the place is getting so popular and the dining area is so small, we often have to wait to sit. Wish they had purchased a bigger place. That still hasn't kept us from going back. If you want a great burger give it a try."
"I went here about a month ago with friends.  The menu is upscale burgers and fries--I got the vegetarian-portabella with goat cheese, arugula, and tomato.  It was messy, but fantastic.  So were the blue cheese fries.  There was a great selection of craft beers, too.  I was really impressed.    I am thrilled to see these types of restaurants in Portage Park.  I've heard poeple compare the quality to Kuma's (without the scene).     The interior space was not large, but there is also outdoor seating.  The service was friendly.  Not really fast, but not too slow. We'll definitely be back."
"So this review is a long time coming.   While visiting Chicago about a month or so ago I happened upon this Diamond among Gems. Everyone knows that Chicago is an AMAZING meat town but who knew that the most amazing Burger I have ever had would be found here.  Now I don't say this lightly but I will say it again LEADBELLY is by and far the MOST amazing burger I have ever had (now I've done it - I have set the expectations extremely high - but I promise it is well deserved).  Let me say to the Evil Genius who came up with grinding amazing beef and Smoked Pork Belly (AKA Bacon) into a burger, I humbly bow before your feet. Oh and if you are GLUTEN-FREE, they have, again, the most amazing bun that I have ever tasted which they research tested an sourced far and wide - no more will you have have to endure the crumbly sawdust and cardboard mixture that you are accustom too this is light and fluffy and actually adds to the taste of this beauty on a bun.  Also if you love yourself a great regular bun they of course make there fresh!  So what did I have, only the Old Time Religion - Arugula, Goat Cheese and Roasted Tomato on a Bun topped with Truffle Aioli!!!!  Need I say more!  Well YES I Need!!  I also had the Leadbelly Fries - uuuuuugh - Stunning fries that take 24 hours to make (that is not a typo - their fries take 24 hours to make!!!) topped with, you guessed it, more pork belly and their house Bourbon BBQ sauce - sweet jeebus I almost fell out of my chair.  I could write so much more about their beer and cider collection, their ridiculously amazing ""Presidentially Approved"" butter cookies (no joke, seriously ask them about it, its a great story) and their location, the staff and owners and just the overall experience but man let me tell you it all matches the spectaularness of their food - head there now!!!This is a TRUE site NOT to miss and I highly recommend ANYONE in the Chicago area or heading there - make a stop because I would gladly hop on a 4 hour-flight again just to head there.  Enjoy my friends and be sure to try this place."
"Checked this place out with a buddy who discovered it.  Wow!  Place is small, burgers are phenomenal.  Had a black betty and the good night Irene, both are must tries.  Blue cheese fries, great assortment of micro brews, kid/family friendly, they seem to have ironed out the concerns expressed in earlier Yelp reviews.  Oh, think they make their buns on premise."
Hands down the best burger joint in the 60634 zip code.
"Love this restaurant specially that is so close my home, I am a burger eater and their gourmet burgers are just that, excellent. I've have almost all their burgers and they are so good, the meat is fresh and cooked to perfection. My favorite fries are the blue cheese and I can't choose a favorite burger because they are equality good. Their craft beer selection is perfect, the staff is great. The only down fall is it very small in there but the decor and atmosphere and tasty food totally makes up for it. Oh and try their cookie it's oh so scrumptious and you can take a jar home, this place is never disappointing."
