The Corned Beef Factory Sandwich Shop
"Have you thought of the last meal you want to have on earth?  Filet mignon, fatty tuna, shrimp & grits, Swiss mushroom burger, Chicago-style hot dog...is any of these on your list?  May I suggest the corned beef sandwich from ""The Corned Beef Factory?""  It's a cash-only establishment, so cut your plastic off before leaving the world for good.  The Corned Beef Factory Sandwich Shop is located on the southwest corner of Morgan and Lake.  Taking the public transportation is beyond convenient (CTA Morgan Green/Pink Line station).  While this place is a popular choice for corporation lunch, the boss lady ensured that Rosa J.'s and Daddy J.'s orders were fulfilled immediately.  Well, we really didn't mind waiting because they rendered great customer service to each and every patron who walked in.  An order of corned beef sandwich combo came with homemade chips, a pickle, and a brown paper box secured with the boy-scout knot.  This carryout box was very Eco-friendly.  This literally was a Sammie present; it was spill-free, fashionable-looking, and recyclable.  For $22 and some change, Daddy J. and I had a plenty to eat, with fountain pops to keep us hydrated.  The corned beef sandwich here was quite tasty, but I preferred the corned beef and the pickle at Kaufman's in Skokie, just a little bit.  Nevertheless, I wanted give a huge shout-out to the CBF for their awesome, crispy, and delicious homemade chips!  Please make them available for purchase.  They do have a nice patio for patrons who choose to ""dine-in.""  I saw lots of people park on Lake, have their flashers on, and pick up their sandwiches and quickly leave the scene before their vehicles got towed.  I've now found a weekday lunch spot, if I can ever make it between 0600 hour to 1500 hour, Monday through Friday."
"It is with great sadness that I write this review as I so desperately wanted to like food more than I did.As a '70s baby, I was born and raised on Bob Elfman's Pastrami and Corned beef.  When they closed in '85, being a policeman, my father began to bring home Manny's which shaped my burgeoning palate.  A a few years passed and AP Deli popped up closer to home and became the de facto for corned beef sandwiches.Fast forward a couple of months and I began working for an airline, with hourly flights to New York.  on one particular trip, I had pastrami sandwiches at Katz, Stage and Carnegie Delis on the same day.  I have been chasing those flavours in Chicago for the past 20 years.  Every time I hear of a new (or preferably old) Deli, I go for a Reuben, corned beef and hot pastrami sandwiches.  It's a bit sacrilegious, but my first sandwich is usually on white with mayo.  most will use that fact to discredit my opinion, but I do so as to taste the meat itself, without it having to compete with the mustard and the rye.After trying the pastrami at Corned Beef Factory, I've come to realize that I'm just not a huge fan of what other reviewers have called ""Chicago-style"" corned Beef and Pastrami, i.e. lean and sliced super thin. I've been to many a North Shore Suburb tilting at this particular windmill and have remained unfulfilled. Due to the leanness, it usually has to be sliced thin in order to remain tender, whereas NY-Style is very unctuous and fatty, making it melt in your mouth tender, even when hand-sliced relatively thickly by knife, with the fat seeping into the bottom slice of bread.Again, to echo other reviewers, I found the Reuben a bit dry, another tablespoon of Thousand Island, a wetter sauerkraut and another slice of swiss would've been greatly appreciated.  The meat was certainly tender and had good mouth feel, but it wasn't the experience I needed it to be.  The pastrami was even more disappointing; there was nowhere near enough fat, and the flavour was much to subtle for me.  It was certainly ""good"", I was just expecting ""GREAT"", something that would become a sense memory, a taste, a smell, a mouth-feel that would instantly take me back to a moment in time as each of my NY sandwiches did.The Chips were light, crispy and very good; pickle was crisp if not overly flavourful, but as the pastrami wasn't particularly fatty(in the GOOD way), there was no need for the vinegary bite of a strongly flavoured pickle to cut through the fat on the tongue and cleanse your palate.Based solely upon all of the positive reviews, both on here and from friends and family, i was surprised at the handful of reviews that favored Manny, but after trying the Corned Beef and Pastrami today, I get it."
"Cash only.- The corned beef and the reuben were both great, and the homemade chips were satisfactory as well. - If you'd like to eat-in, there's some counters for standing but no chairs. Primarily a take-out place for sure.- One reserved loading spot for pick-up directly in front which is convenient. - Decor was nice, very clean inside.- Friendly staff, the woman who takes the orders at the start of the line was great.Definitely worth giving this place a shot if you like corned beef."
Best Italian beef sandwich I've had in Chicago. Got mine dipped and it was not gross and greasy like Al's. Corned beef sandwich was great. HUGE portion. The meat is very high quality. Warm and super thinly sliced. Not a fan of the bread because I do not like fennel. I would order it with french bread next time (personal taste).
"What a cool place! Possibly the best Reuben I've ever had!This is a bare bones place where you walk in and order from a menu of about 4 options. They are slicing corned beef fresh constantly, and they have a potato chip maker constantly pumping out fresh chips. Keep in mind:1 cash only 2 very limited seating (outside only)Food comes in a box with hand tied twine around it. Very nice presentation. I would highly recommend this place n"
My good friend has been raving about this place for a little while now so we decided to hop on the Green Line from State & Lake to Morgan (right off of the stop actually) to see whats up here.First thing I noticed was that it is cash only and luckily one of my buds had cash as I would have been assed out. I chose the Reuben over the pastrami sandwich (close choice) and it was very good...there is a huge meat distribution going o here. LOL Its a very nice size and they give you a packaging (see pics) to take out in case you are ordering to go or if you could not finish the job. Sandwiches come with chips and a pickle on the side. There is a small standing space on the side wall if you want to eat inside. You can also buy corned beef brisket here FYI
"I love Reubens, they are my favorite sandwich--and this is a a good one!  Corned Beef Factory sandwich was really filling and delicious...better than any famous deli or pub could make for me! This is a splurge meal that I could go to once a month!"
"I lost a few calories getting to the factory. I'd been wanting to try this place for a while, since I've seen it so many times in the top-5 ""Best of Yelp"" restaurants. But I was dawdling in the South Loop, and it was 2:25. The CTA bus tracker told me 2 minutes for the #3. At Roosevelt & Michigan, it told me the Green line was 3 minutes away. I bolted to the station, ran up the escalator and made my train. (Was it I smelling bad from my sprint? No, luckily it was the guy next to me. I moved--can't have any lingering stank when you're running to fine dining.) When I got the Morgan stop I... Well, I just had to cross the street; I was right there and it was 2:55.When I told the folks here of my cross-town journey, they said that they would have let me in if I had been a few minutes late. In fact, I could have called ahead and, since they still have to clean up after 3; I could have picked-up after that time.My mom is from St. Paul, and whenever we went there, we would make a pilgrimage to Cecil's for corned beef sandwiches. Mom always paid extra for the ""extra lean"" stuff, and it was amazing. Childhood memories are sweet, but Cecil (if there was a Cecil) would have stopped in his tracks if he saw the corned beef here. While I was chatting to one of the chefs (?), he said that they trim fat at no less than three stages of cutting and slicing the meat. Wow, was it good, as well as the chips! I immediately took it outside and devoured half of it on a barrel out front. While it would be nice to have a few chairs, it was like camping, having hunted down prey with only a $10 bill as a weapon. I've always admired how Potbelly grew from the single store I used to visit across from Children's Memorial to there being a few too many, but all because they make simple sandwiches with good ingredients.Nothing could be more simple about a corned beef sandwich at this factory, and nothing could have made it taste better.Since I had already gotten so much exercise for the day, I treated myself to some honey puffs. ""They're just donuts,"" I thought to myself before taking a bite. Sometimes snap judgements ARE too prejudicial: How could I have been so dismissive, so insulting? These, my friends, should be called fresh, hot, sweet pillows of pleasure. Satisfied, and having the second half of the sandwich for dinner, I went to lose a little more weight across the street at the barbershop."
"Good God! This place is cuisine equivalent of having a threesome with a couple of supermodels if you are into corned beef! If fact, if I was hungry enough, I would send the supermodels packing for a box from this joint! I got the opportunity to swing by this place when I was in the city on business and it was a great lunchtime decision. The setup was somewhat comical too. I asked a couple of clients that I was taking to lunch if they had ever heard of it  and they just smirked at me giving off a nonverbal ""you must be kidding retard"". I really do not need to go into too much detail on product as I can see my fellow yelpers have given everyone the low down, but I will give some of my own unique observations on what this place has to offer. First off, this place kills it with simplicity. By that, I mean with the food networkized brains that so many in both the culinary world and the general public have become infested with, it's nice to see a place that keeps it real. No red wine reduction glaze or sautéed artichoke hearts to take away from the flavor of the corned beef. Most places that go that route are trying to make up for the fact that their corned beef is dry, poorly prepared, and therefore sucks. Don't believe me? Pay a visit to 99% of the Irish Pubs of the world on St. Patricks Day and it will be readily apparent. The price point here is also very affordable given the quality. As to portion size, unless you happen to be an offensive lineman for the Bears, if you leave this place hungry you have very serious problems indeed. The line looked daunting initially, but the staff got through it in rapid succession. Also, as has been pointed out, make sure you have cash as they don't take cards. My previous personal favorite for corned beef was from Zabar's Deli in Manhattan (80th and Broadway if you are ever in town), but this tops even that. The probability of me returning to this place when I am in the area is 100%. I am looking forward to trying the pastrami also."
"What is with the 5 stars on this place?  Their corned beef is boringly average.  Yes, the sandwich has a lot meat, yes the chips are tasty, and yes the line moves fast, but all of that doesn't matter if the corned beef is AVERAGE!!!  This doesn't even taste like it's house made corned beef.  Its tastes like it was pulled out of bag and heated up.  I am sooooooo disappointed.    There are so many better options for corned beef in this city.  I won't ever come back."
"What a fantastic place for lunch. When you walk in, you are greeted by the nicest lady who will take your order. If you like pastrami and corned beef, order the Tom & Jerry, an off-menu creation that features heaps of both. I ordered it with spicy mustard and Swiss, a great combo. Also try the honey puffs which are reminiscent of beignets filled with honey goodness. The pickle spears and kettle chips round out the meal. If you take it too go, your chips might get a little soggy. Eat it fresh!"
"Really good sandwich, love the layout and the woman at the door taking orders couldn't have been nicer and fun.  I got the jack and Jill (half corned beef other half pastrami) to try both.  I am a pastrami guy and both were great and the size for $10 is more than reasonable for pastrami or corned beef.  Oh and the chips......the chips were fantastic.  Its a very good sandwich place that will be packed soon."
"Loved my experience here. We were greeted at the door by a friendly lady who walked us through the menu.  I ordered the Reuben which comes with house made chips and a pickle - all were delicious! Also ordered the Honey Puffs, and they made them and brought them out to us at the end of our meal so we can have them fresh and piping hot.  The place itself is really cute and has character.  Simple concept and they are executing it perfectly."
"Yet another fine example of why it's so great to be an eater in Chicago.This place knows how to do one thing well -- corned beef -- and that's what they do.I'm not a mustard fan, so I just had a plain CB on rye...and it was amazing. No silly aiolis or slaw or other ""cutesy"" things you might find on a hipster corned beef sandwich. This thing is the real deal. Get one."
"Decided to randomly make the trip to this spot for lunch and was not disappointed. I ordered a corned beef sandwich, which came with mustard (cheese if that's your sort of thing...eh), house chips and a pickle on the side-- all for $10 bucks. Corned beef was fresh, warm and thinly sliced and the portions definitely matched the price. Plus, everything came wrapped in a cool box. You gotta love presentation.Be wary that when coming, there is no indoor seating. Also, I wasn't really enamored with their chips, but they come free with the sandwich. If you're not a fan I'm sure they'd be happy to leave them out. It's also cash only but there's an ATM outside the establishment. Almost as good as Manny's but not quite...four stars."
"Made in house, their corned beef and pastrami is out of this world. Don't forget to order some honey puffs (fried dough with honey and cinnamon). If you are going to be bad, might as well go all the way.  Excellent service, as well!"
"Had a Reuben and it was one of the best I have had. Everything was fresh and neatly packaged. I must say this Reuben was better than Mannys and only $11 dollars.  For that price you received a pickle, homemade chips, and the Reuben.  If you like Mannys I would recommend you try The Corn Beef Factory and compare the two. They only downside to the spot is they have limited seating outdoors only and a small standing area and they only accept cash. This is definitely a hiding gem."
"That time I was running an errand during lunch, googled ""corned beef"" and this came up .3 miles from me. Of course I drove over.This place seems new. It's a place to come grab some darn good corned beef. I walked in with a big craving and was greeted by everyone there. They are so nice and they seem to love what they are serving.I got myself a $12 rueben - it fed two of us at work. Massive and delicious.They take care in their packaging but the way it's setup this could be a bottleneck should it get a long line, chipotle style. The string-tied box is cute but I think they may need to speed this part up with a cute sticker or something. Let's be honest, we are ripping into the box to get to the meat immediately after anyway!I'll be back. I crave this food a lot."
Thought the pastrami was outstanding with spicy mustard and homemade chips. My pal had the half pastrami half corned beef also excellent. I'll be back.
Super high quality meats for their sandwiches. The whole place is built perfectly. Remember: CASH ONLYYou get to view your food being prepared and have them weight the POUNDS of meat before it goes int your sandwich. This place is a staple of why Chicago has some of the best food and best people.
"AMAZING. SO TASTY. I could go on forever. Also, fabulous service. I highly recommend the Reuben. Perfect."
"Amazing! (In my Oprah voice)I've been trying to get around to write this review for some time now.  I gave five stars because The corned beef is good, and you know how you pay $12 for a deli sandwich and it's not that great and all you get is the sandwich? Well, at The corned beef factory you spend like $10.50 and get the sandwich (sliced in half) which you can save half for later it's so much plus, housemade chips and a pickle.  Hell, you get less of a meal at subway for the same price. If you are in the area it's definitely worth the try."
Not in order...#1: it's conveniently located under the Morgan green line station#2: they hang their menu from meat hooks#3: solid corned beef sandwich!#4: friendly and quick service#5: can't complain about the price ($10) for a ~1lbs sandwichIt's not rocket science. It's a sandwich. They're not doing anything new here. But they are doing it well!I'll go back again with out hesitation.
"Soon to be a lunchtime staple in Fulton Market.This sandwich shop had just opened a couple weeks ago. They are open from 6AM-3PM and I work close to the loop so I never get a chance to try this out. I finally got to try this on my day off and I was very impressed.They basically only have a handful of options. Corned beef, Reuben, Italian, Hot Dog, Pastrami and Italian Beef and are all around $10 including homemade chips. I got the Reuben sandwich with spicy mustard and swiss. It is one of the best Reuben's I have had around here. The thing I like about it is that it is not over the top. The rye bread does not have seeds and isn't too overpowering and the corned beef is delicious. One caveat is this is cash only. Make sure you bring some cash to be sure you don't go away empty handed. Once Google moves in I'm sure the line will be out the door for lunch. (not that it won't be already)"
"I'm not one to write a lot of reviews but this place felt different. Like what a sandwich shop probably used to be like. First thing you notice as you walk in is the old wood plank walls and stainless steel kitchen area. Every employee here was wearing a throwback butchers smock like you would see in the old Fulton Market area.  Speaking of, they have a great picture what I thought was the Fulton Market back in 20's or 30's...very cool!  Let's get to the reason I came in...the sandwich menu although very small seemed right.  4-5 sandwiches....that's it! Very, Very Simple.  I tried the Corned beef Sandwich with fresh in house cut potato chips. Unbelievable! I knew the corned beef would be good since I think  it is actually made here (hence ""The Corned Beef Factory""), but the bread was outstanding.  My mom always told me that the bread makes the sandwich and this place did not disappoint.  Thanks Corned Beef Factory for giving me a nice fast and fresh option in an area that is getting crowded with high end establishments. You are a real hidden gem, but I have a hunch it won't be hidden for long.Hope to be back soon!"
"Great place for corned beef, $12 bucks is a pretty good value for a rueben, pickle and chips in this hood IMO plus it was fast and good, which is great for a working slob like me. They present the sandwiches very neatly and with a nice little tag telling you your name. They tie it up with a big old piece of string that you can save to wrap around your least favorite coworkers throat later. Is that what that is for? That part seems excessive. But if the only thing I can complain about is the superfluous string on the box of delish sandwich, you know you are doing it right.  Service is prompt and friendly. There is a bench you can lean over and spill kraut onto while you wolf your food. Slow down, enjoy it. Sandwich was the perfect ballet of beef, kraut, 1000 island, cheese and bread. I think Manny's slightly edges them out by a mustache hair but I would go here again. I have to, for the honey puffs. Which is what my chest is turning into after all these new good spots keep opening up. I can see the appeal though, very tasty. Cash only."
This might have been the best corned beef sandwich I have ever had.The Italian beef is also amazing and I highly recommend it with both sweet and hot peppers and wet.The homemade chips are outstanding.Perfect bread!Great pickles!Service is with a genuine smile and you actually feel appreciated for your business which is a rarity these days.Cute place and ultra clean.This place is perfect and well worth the trip.AWESOME
Epic corned beef and pastrami. Healthy portions and super lean meat - check out my pictures!
"Best corned beef sandwich in Chicago. Friendly staff, cool building and location. Highly recommend this place. Note: cash only and they close at 3pm."
"Sorry to be the first downer, but this place is not that good.  The quality of the corned beef is just not there.  It's a little thin and a little tough for my taste.  I'm not even sure they're curing it in-house.  It seems like mass produced deli meat (think Boar's Head, etc) instead of what I look for in corned beef, which is thicker slices and tender crumbling meat.  Some of that connective tissue needs to be softened and the fat should be partially rendered and buttery.  I've been to Katz's (NY) and I've been to Schwartz's (Montreal) and they're both so much better than this place.  Chicago is a meat town!  We have to demand better.  Bread, chips and pickle were all good.  Quantity was good but for $10 and with a cash only policy, I want premium quality corned beef."
"Good: Lots of meat, big sandwich, house made chips and pickles.Bad: Cash only, no seating (currently)This place seems a bit weird in that it's like walking into a packing facility the first time you visit but they are very helpful. Their menu is very short so it's not hard to decide. The sandwich was really good. The reuben I had was really tasty but it was like 90% meat. Which is great, because it's pretty thick for all meat but a bit more kraut would have been good. I'll certainly go back and try the other sandwiches, maybe see if I can customize my order a bit... get more topping."
"Love. 1. Incredibly nice welcome as soon as I walked in. 2. Small but appropriate amount of options.3. Super fast and friendly service.4. Trendy shop but not hipster trendy, ya know?So good nom nom."
"Yummy!  Had the reuben and it was delish!  Could have used maybe just a bit more sauerkraut but the homeade potato chips made up for it.  No place to sit down so this is a bare bones, standing counter only joint - which I was okay with but know that going in!  And CASH ONLY.  They'll have patio seating when it gets warmer but if you're looking for a great sandwich, this is the place!"
I didn't know a corned beef sandwich could be so good. The corned beef is absolutely perfect and piled high. All you need is the delicious rye bread and a bit of mustard and you have an amazing sandwich. The chips are on point as well. I can see why this place has such good reviews. Definitely a believer.
"When you walk in, you're greeted immediately by friendly staff who takes your order. I got a Reuben with chips and a pickle. It was delicious! The corned beef is incredibly moist and complimented by the mustard, slaw and thousand island sauce- all proportions were spot on. The rye bread was great, as was the pickle (though next time I'll get an extra pickle for the second half.) the portion is pretty large so you have to be pretty hungry, and it's cash only. I loved the string tied box they serve it in. There isn't formal seating but you can eat standing inside or outside. To the people comparing it to Schwartz's in Montreal- I used to live there and this is not the same style smoked meat, so you can't actually compare. Both are delicious."
"A much needed quick spot for the West Loop!  Quick, cool carry out concept and delicious.  Thank you for making WL great!"
"Me and a co worker were in the area and we decided to stop by since we had read an article in the RedEye, were it said that their sandwiches were better than Manny's... Oh my gawd was that Tom and Jerry delicious!!! Pastrami and Corn beef with that spicy mustard and cheese!!!! The homemade potato chips were fiyyyaaa also! Definitely coming back! I knew I was going to love it once I seen them in the Red eye a week ago! The service was great also... the guy that took my order and took my money (think he's the boss) gave me a free drink! I will definitely come back with the wife! My $11 were well spent on lunch today!"
"If you like a no nonsense, cooked in house, Chicago portion sized sandwich then you need to stop by the Corned Beef Factory.  The corned beef rueben is delicious and piled high on panini pressed rye.  Literally the only question I was asked was if I wanted the pickle on the side.  Conveniently located off the Morgan green line stop this place is too close to the loop to pass up for a longer lunch.  In my opinion this spot is better than Perry's or Eppi's when we're talkin corned beef.Cash only & only a small wall bar for eat ins."
"Really solid reuben/corned beef in general.  Portion size is great and the corned beef is lean with good flavor.  As a bonus, the staff is fast, nice and efficient . Great for lunch. One thing to note is it is cash and carry."
Great corned beef! As you should expect with the name being what it is. I will definitely go back.It is take out and cash only so be ready. The staff was very nice. Great sandwiches.
