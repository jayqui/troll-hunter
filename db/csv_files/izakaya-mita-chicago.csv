Izakaya Mita
"wow.. what a surprise!Got a gilt city deal for a 6 course meal. I usually lower my expectations for restaurants on gilt city/groupon type website, but Izakaya Mita really delivered! For once, I would actually come back and pay full price for a gilt city/groupon restaurant!Our 6 courses were consisted of classic izakaya food - takoyaki, skewers, cold ramen, etc. They were all simple but done well and satisfying! The cold ramen (hiyashi chuka) was great and refreshing. We also really liked the mushrooms, the takoyaki, and the cold cucumber with spicy sauce. The menu was very authentic. You could totally see that these people know what an izakaya is supposed to be like.The biggest surprise of the night was how great the drink menu was. They have a huge list of sake, Japanese beer (no, not just kirin/asahi). Surprisingly, a cocktail I got was shockingly good... like the Violet Hour or better good. I dont know the name, but it's red, and the waitresses recommended it.My meal here was the most satisfying meal I've had in a while. I applaud them for not just putting sushi and Asahi on the menu and call it a day. The whole menu was well thought out, food was authentically prepared. It's surprisingly hard to find good non-sushi Japanese food in Chicago. Izakaya Mita was such a gem."
Amazing sake. Very knowledgeable staff and delicious easy to eat food. The staff are warm and friendly and the owner is always trying to make the experience better. Highly recommend checking this place out.
"On Friday 5/15/15, I had the greatest meeting at Izakaya Mita. It consisted the chairman and his colleague from the All Japan Sushi Association (AJSA) and fellow all American world class sushi chefs. The AJSA is holding a sushi competition to look for the number 1 sushi chef from the U.S. to compete in Japan later this year and the U.S. Preliminary round was held in Chicago and I was one of the few competitors for the occasion. So, for the competition, I've arrived at Chicago prior to the date and I was craving anything japanese since all I was eating was Chicago hot dogs and sandwiches. I needed sake, mirin, and soy sauce! Since I was alone in an unfamiliar location, I asked other competitors to join me for dinner and that's when the concept of yelp came in handy. I looked up japanese near downtown Chicago and Mita came up.Told the other competitors if they wanted to join and became a party !At first, we were all skeptical due to the fact that none of us was familiar with this place but my god, it was one of the best night of my life. We were all craving japanese food and everything was legit! From the tsukedashi (appetizer) to the main dishes, every thing blew our minds. Even the chairman of the AJSA said he'll be back when he's in Chicago and I can't agree more!Helen san! (Mita's mama san) was super nice and we even got the chance to see where the magic happens. Great hospitality and that is the core of Japanese cuisine. I hope they do great in the future and I will definitely come back when I visit Chicago. Thanks to Helen and her staff at Izakaya Mita!"
Food is only okay and food and drinks are on the pricier side for small portions. I thought it was only ok yet my friends seemed to like it.
"I came here for dinner last night with my parents. My experience here was overall pretty good. I thought that the service was great but the food was just all right in my opinion. This is what we ordered:-Sashimi Combination $16 - This came with 3 pieces each of the salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. We really enjoyed the yellowtail and salmon but felt that the tuna was a bit too chewy.-Octopus Balls $7 - These were very good! I loved the batter and the little bits of octopus inside-Chicken Breast Skewer $3 - A bit dry, not too flavorful-Beef Tenderloin Skewer $5.50 - Very moist but had absolutely no flavor at all! Also, $5.50 for this??? It was tiny!-Squash Tempura $4 - so so so good! We loved this!-Tonkatsu $9.50 - We had to pay extra for rice, which I found pretty ridiculous. This was definitely fried very well but the pork inside was too tough and chewy-Tonkatsu Ramen - $12.50 - My parents really enjoyed this and I did too. I felt that the noodles were cooked perfectly but the broth was a bit too salty and not flavorful enoughOverall I think that this place has pretty good food. I think that their prices are a bit high for the quality and amount that you get however. Still, very good service!"
"Food is fantastic, beers are fantastic, cocktails great, great staff, become a sake expert here, beers you can't get anywhere else, great for dates, great for families, great for loners, great for gatherings, great for wanting to try something new, and great for casual dining!!!!! They especially love people who use run on sentences when they write."
"Amazing Amazing Amazing!!Every single thing about this place is delicious! Went here for a double date opening weekend and got seated within 15 minutes. The list of sake is impeccable. You can get warm sake, cold sake, floral sake, fruity sake or traditional sake. They have cute little sake cans, that are super authentic, which is a nice touch to this theme of japanese homey-ness - tapas, comfy japanese faire, and solid drinks not to mention Japanese beer on tap!We tried the following:Japanese Pancakes with Shrimp - MUST GET! This was seriously the most delicious thing I have ever tasted in a long time. It's a perfect sweet and savory duo!Oyster Balls - Contrary to what you first might think, these are really balls made out of octopus =) Super delicious. The batter is thin so it doesn't ruin the integrity of the octopus, and the octopus is cooked to perfection.Tenderloin Skewers - So tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned. We had to each order one of these because they were that good!Chicken Wings - Yum! These come in threes and were really flavorful and tender.Chicken Skin - Really unique style of cooking and it was the perfect touch to our meal.Sashimi - Super fresh and yummy!Beef Sliders (on a rice bun) - It's more wow than wow bao!I will definitely be back and I am excited to try more things on their menu. This place is also very reasonably priced. I think the most expensive thing we ordered was Sashimi, which was still cheaper than most sushi spots!The people that work here were super nice and attentive. The best thing besides the food is the ambiance and location of this place. It is a warm cozy Bucktown spot, perfect for a date night or a friends gathering. I anticipate coming here with all my friends in the near future!"
"Popped in here over the weekend for dinner to visit a friend in the area. The restaurant has a hipster vibe but the service was unpretentious.We ate at the bar and had the Kitty beer, pork belly, steak slider, and shrimp slider. I highly recommend the sliders but left still hungry.The food was good (not great), and for the prices there are better options in the neighborhood. I recommend coming here for specialty beer and bar snacks -- don't expect a full dinner."
"We tried a lot of interesting, tasty things but the Hiyashi Chuka was easily the best part."
"This restaurant was truly amazing. The service was impeccable and the food was delightful! I recommend the gyu slider and the shrimp tempura.  The sauces like the spicy mayo and the wasabi ranch add a fun kick to your meal. The Saki list was unreal, along with the beer. Go here! It's amazing!"
"Wow!!! Good food, good service and good ambience. .. the bartender  was very helpful especially  with the cocktails. I was craving a mojito and he made something similar to that and even better.  I would definitely come back."
"Went here w/ 7 of my friends on a Saturday night. It's a small restaurant and when we came in it was packed. We were quoted about an hour wait, but the hostess said we could be seated right away if we split up into 2 groups, since 2 tables on different ends of the room just opened up. Of course, food takes precedence over friendship and we all instantly agreed to be split up into 2 tables. Highlights included:-Sake sashimi: smooth and fresh-Pork belly okonomiyaki: one of the better Japanese pancakes I've had. Great texture, flavor, and lots of pork.-Chicken gizzards and chicken liver: tasty. Not chewy or gritty at all.-Ika sugatayaki: grilled fresh squid. My table of 4 loved this - so much so that we ordered another plate after we demolished the 1st one! The squid was delicate and was grilled to perfection. A must try!All in all, a really good restaurant. Will definitely be coming back"
"I wanted to love it! I really did. I love sharing food so it's hard to go wrong with a tapas style Japanese restaurant.We ordered the Okonomiyaki (waiter's suggestion) with pork belly, Moriawase sashimi, Ebi Mayo, and of the grill we got chicken white and dark meet, beef tenderloin, and salmon. The grill was good, especially the beef, and I liked the Ebi Mayo, but it wasn't enough to make me want to come back. I was disappointed by the Okonomiyaki since the waiter suggested it, I just couldn't get myself to eat it after 1 bite.Really worth trying at least once, but it's not my preference."
"One of the best Izakaya I have been to (better than many even in Japan). Exceptional quality and diversity of Sake Japanese whiskies and rare Japanese liquors (and of course Japanese beer). The food is excellent and the Owner and staff are over the top! Great place to have a drink while eating a bite. If you are looking for a true Japanese Izakaya vibe, that is the place to be!"
"Izakaya Mita has been on my radar for places to try ever since I heard of the buzz surrounding its opening.  I've eaten at my fair share of Izakaya and yakatori joints on the West Coast, so it was exciting to even imagine having a prospective place like this at my disposal.  Mita would definitely fill a void in a much sorry area Chicago is lacking - good, traditional Japanese food.  My girlfriend and I dropped in on a Wednesday night.  The place was nearly packed, and we were greeted by the friendly host.  The grilled items are what highlight the menu.  Additionally, you can order cold and hot appetizers, sashimi, ramen, and other larger hot items.  We had just returned from LA a few days back and had dinner at our favorite yakatori joint, so naturally the grilled items were what we headed straight for.  We were super hungry, so we opted for two skewers of each item we ordered - one for each of us.  Service was SLOW!  It took about a half hour before our first skewers came out.  To our dismay, they only brought us one of each (first and second orders)!!!!!Chicken skins - ordered these with the salt and sake flavoring.  First off, they were still a little slimy and just warm - not even close to the crisp I've become accustomed to at other establishmentsBeef Tenderloin - ordered them also with the salt and sake flavoring but they arrived with the teriyaki season.  The seasoning completely over-powered a really good piece of meat.  The tenderloin was cooked medium rare, but the sweet-salty tastes killed it.  Chicken liver - ordered them with the salt and sake flavoring.  By far, the first order we received was the highlight of the meal.  Not too salty, but just cooked right.  They were good, so we put in an order for TWO skewers.  Again after about 25 minutes, only one skewer appeared.  This time, however, the liver was lukewarm.   I was almost afraid to eat it!Asparagus wrapped with bacon - like the chicken liver, the first order was pretty good - good enough for us to warrant a second order.  Unfortunately, like the chicken liver second order, the skewer showed up barely cooked.  The asparagus was nearly raw and the bacon had barely been cooked.  In addition, we ordered the meat balls and dark meat, which were unremarkable but edible.  We did enjoy the hamachi kama (yellowtail collar).  It was actually seasoned well, and actually cooked like it should be.  After this, I was still hungry so I had to order some white rice to fill myself up.  Prices are what I would expect for an izakaya.  While service was terrible, our server was super nice and apologetic for their shortcomings.  I suspect that the back of the house operations are as much to blame for their inability to execute.  In any case, I was quite disappointed by my experience at Mita.  I really hate giving two stars to a local establishment, but they really need to improve on a lot of things.  I'm not rushing to head back anytime soon, but perhaps I will after they iron out the inefficiencies in a year or so."
"Picture this:Valentine's Day 2015. Freeze your nose off cold. No dinner reservations. I walk in alone, hoping that my perpetually late friends will show up sooner than their usual 20 minutes late.""Table for 3 please""""We're actually booked until 10 but let me see if we can squeeze you in at the bar""15 minutes later, I'm drinking alone at the bar waiting for my friends. Punctual or pathetic?""Are your friends still joining you?""Long story short, my friends eventually made it, and we eventually got ourselves a table. The ambiance at Izakaya Mita was really charming and the food and drinks were also tasty and well priced. I can't say the ramen was the best in the city, but I was craving yakitori and it definitely satisfied. Can I survive on a strict diet of chicken skins and liver?The real selling point is definitely the staff. While waiting for my dining companions, I got to chat with the owner and all the bartenders, and everyone was incredibly sweet and very helpful with their explanations and recommendations on menu items. Our check was presented with three long stem roses sans thorns and though those died in the bitter cold, our insides were warmed by our pleasant dining experience.I just hope they don't remember me as that girl drinking by herself and raving about extra crispy chicken skewers on valentines day."
Had a great time here with friends trying different orders of food and drink!  Solid but for the price I'd say it was alright.  Service was great and the ambiance was nice...
"Stopped in on this beautiful Sunday evening at 6pm.  My wife and I were feeling a bit peckish after a long walk. What a find! This place is a gem. I love sake, and this place is my new nirvana. Their list is dizzying.Food-wise, had the Pork Gyoza and Maguro Avocado Salad to start. Both generous portions were super fresh and delicious. We followed with with an order of Ebi Mayo sliders for each of us. 2 big crunchy & spicy fresh shrimp on a perfect rice cake. Soooo good. (getting full;)Also liked the featured Japanese beer that day, can't recall the name, sorry.To sum up, this place is sumpthin!"
"Just had dinner here with Kenny and a friend. It was the best meal I've had in a while. It was probably also the best Japanese food I've had in Chicago.We started off with some complimentary pickled celery, which were a bit too acidic for my taste. However, once we got to the items we actually ordered, I was in heaven. From the bincho-tan grill, we ordered chicken skin. It was delicious as expected. We also got great chicken liver and an amazing hamachi. The chicken livers still tasted like liver, which we liked but I understand isn't for everyone. Kenny noted the great knife skills on the hamachi.We tried a sakana and unagi rice sliders; both were delicious. Of the two, my favorite was the unagi because of the eel sauce. The sakana one tasted like a fried fish over rice, which Kenny said tasted like something he'd like to eat when hungover. To me, it tasted like something from childhood. My absolute favorite at the restaurant, however, were the takoyaki, okonomiyaki (with pork belly), and the yaki-ramen. The takoyaki were missing some bonita flakes, but they were one of the best I've had in Chicago. The octopus pieces were generously cut and the batter was perfect. This was also my first time trying the okonomiyaki, which Kenny told me was usually a bit thinner, but I thought it was delicious. Surprisingly, it wasn't as sweet as I thought and was actually savory. And I didn't think I would like the yaki-ramen, but I loved it over the miso ramen that we got. It was a mix of yakisoba and ramen so you get pan-fried ramen. It was delicious. The miso ramen was a solid, but I think we've gotten spoiled by our friend who makes his own ramen. Overall, our bill came out to be around $30 per person, including tips. Not bad. I'm definitely coming back to try their other items.The service here was also on point. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the food. We loved his recommendation for the yaki-ramen. When I left for the ladies' room, they even folded up my napkin for me. That was surprising. And we even witnessed the proprietor outside shoving snow. Amazing!"
"Toilet doors were clean, freshly painted. Nice hostess. Pleasant people -- all contributing to my higher than would have been rating.Food - imagine a fast food Chinese restaurant....only Japanese recipes used, kinda. My wife and son were more forgiving than me, hence they look much younger than I do.We ordered many dishes. I am glad we did not order sashimi. Checking it at another table, looked poorly cut and badly presented. Service - Good, albeit rushed. Please donot hand in the check with the desert. Regardless I really liked our server.Ambiance.  For Bucktown people kinda reminded me of Silver Cloud only obviously nowhere as good.  For an Izakaya (Japanese bar) interesting how many families with kids, like us were there.Other highly positive reviews. With all due respect to people's personal taste when a few reviews from people with limited reviews and ""friends"" come up, i do not take it seriously. Regardless the end result will be an overly bloated average rating.I had given Takashi, next door a one star too ....walking by it on after our meal at Mita i wished we had gone there instead.We had wanted to try Mita ever since they were doing construction, as they are a neighborhood restaurant. So I feel as bad for us as for them that the dinner was not good. Sorry guys, I really wanted to like your ""izakaya."" Sincerely wishing you success."
"I've been wanting to try this place ever since seeing it on my daily commute on the Damen 50.  We have yet to find a really great yakitori place in Chicago that rivals the one we love in NYC.It's been open for about 1 month so I was glad we were able to get a table last minute on a Friday night - no wait.  The menu is extensive and can be overwhelming if you are not used to it.  Our server gave a great overview  - he also used to work in the kitchen, so he gave us his favorites and recommendations.  I must say I cannot comment on the alcohol, sashimi, or fish dishes with me being pregnant.  We started with the Okonomiyaki japanese pancake with ebi (shrimp) and kani (crab).  It's a pretty hearty appetizer divided into 4 pieces.  Both Hubby and I thought it was the highlight of dinner.  The skewers serve about 2.5 oz of meat so one is good for two people if you want to order one of a variety to taste.  The dark meat chicken was okay, but the extra crispy chicken skin was the best.  Don't forget to order it extra crispy!  We tried the oyster mushrooms Shio style (salt and sake), but they were way too salty.  The server was nice enough to exchange them for the Tare style (teriyaki) and someone came by (the manager or owner?) who admitted the first dish was too salty and apologized.  The dish itself had a generous portion of mushrooms served on a plate rather than a skewer.  The Tare style had more of a smoky flavor, but I think the mushrooms were too big pieces that made it hard to divide up.  We also tried the grilled fresh squid - a massive entree dish.  We were only able to finish 75% of it.  It was the next best dish of the night.  I'd like to try some of the tempura and the rice sliders next time, and of course the sashimi and more of the fish dishes in the future!"
"My wife and I love this place! Owners are super nice and always stop by to welcome us.  The food is amazing - must haves include the Shrimp Tempura, any of the ""sliders"" and the hamachi collar. Check it out - you won't be disappointed."
"Since last spring when my husband and I moved from Japan, we tried several Japanese restaurants and sushi bars, and we were disappointed and almost fed up with fake Japanese food or something only inspired by Japanese food.Now, finally, we know where we should go!!Tonight we got completely knocked out with the authentic and tasteful dishes, the fabulous selection of drinks and the friendly staff who make you feel as if you have certainly met them somewhere before.We'll definitely come back soon.For many American people who don't know what izakaya is, it could be a 'bad service'.  But for those who long for a real one, this is heaven!"
"We stopped in on a whim and were not disappointed. All of the dishes we tried were absolutely fantastic!The fish in the sashimi salad were very fresh and paired well with the greens. We got the gyu (beef tenderloin) rice slider, which was tender, and the chicken skin bincho-tan, which I didn't enjoy as much.We also loved the okonomiyaki pancake (we got the one with ebi and kani) and the miso ramen. The pancake came with a special sweet sauce and was very savory. The toppings were pretty standard for the miso ramen, but the broth was hearty and delicious.The ika sugatayaki (grilled whole squid) was by far our favorite dish - perfectly grilled and don't forget to squeeze the lemon on top!We ended the meal with a mochi ice cream trio (strawberry, mango, and green tea) that I thought was nothing too special. It was a little hard so it was difficult to cut into to split.Our server, Nick, was really friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and made it a great dining experience. We will definitely be back to try some more!"
Jeremy was awesome! My friend and I have never experienced Japanese tapas before and he was so helpful! Jeremy volunteered to choose our dinner for us....asked all the right questions to customize our experience!So glad he did because I would have never ordered the mushrooms or jalapeños and they were delicious! Everything was very tasty and new and what a great experience!We were very happy to share a bottle of wine while letting someone else choose for us...risky but very rewarding ;)We were greeted by the owner and she is a doll! Making sure we were enjoying ourselves and explaining to us what Izakaya meant...Japanese pub with small plates of Japanese food.  Welcome to the neighborhood!! So happy to have you!
"Dined here with 3 other people this past weekend. We arrived at 7pm on Friday and were lucky enough to be seated right away. I think at that point there was maybe one other open table. 3 out of 4 of us ordered drinks. I had a glass of wine, which was oddly priced at 9.50; the other two had the Norwegian-something cocktail and both of them enjoyed it. For food, we ordered a bunch of different items, some to share, some for ourselves. We each ordered some of the skewered meats, among them: chicken meatballs, dark chicken meat, beef tenderloin, pork belly, and chicken skins. Not a single complaint about any of those. From the warm appetizers section we ordered a mushroom dish, the name of which I cannot remember, but it was a very good starter to share (and would make a great side dish if you can recreate at home). We got an order of the veggie tempura and that was another suitable dish to share among 4 people. Nothing to rave about, just run-of-the-mill tempura. All of us also ordered their rice sliders, among them: the ebi mayo, fried fish, beef tenderloin, and chicken. The ebi mayo was hands down the best. So good, in fact, that we all ordered another round of those sliders. The service, while extremely friendly, is still working out some kinks. A few of the things we initially ordered never showed up. Once we got the server's attention and asked about the dishes, he kind of got an ""oh shit, I forgot"" look on his face, but didn't really apologize in any way. Also, pretty much everything we ordered was placed in front of the wrong person. The menu is a little confusing/overwhelming. I think a little more explanation by the server at the beginning would be helpful. Maybe something to consider when training staff! Pricing was totally on point. Our total came out to just under $110 (minus tip) which I think is incredibly fair for a 4 person dinner that included 3 drinks. Happy to have this izakaya in the neighborhood and looking forward to coming back in a few months to try the ramen dishes!"
"This place is perfect. Great food. Great, sake, wine and beer.So much to choose from on the menu from Sashimi salad, awesome mushrooms, chicken skins on a skewer to the unbelievably perfect grilled hamachi collar."
"LOVED this place! The vibe is super casual and cool. The service was great and the food was fantastic!! We asked our server for recommendations. She suggested a sake flight which was perfect. We shared plates ranging from the tuna maguro salad to the okonomiyaki--so good!! Definitely get the shishito peppers, and sample the many awesome skewers! We got the hiyashi chuka noodles and they were delicious and refreshing--perfect for summer. We finished the meal with the banana tempura and it was terrific! A great neighborhood spot that is very worthy of checking out!"
"Decent izakaya joint in Chicago. The menu is straight forward and our waiter was nice enough to explain a lot of the details to our party of four. Coming from Hawaii, Izakaya bars are the equivalent to irish pubs here is Chicago. I must say its a rather bold move to open one in the midwest since these places have more of a raw approach to japanese food than the typical sushi spot. So big bonus for that! Highlights for me was the sashimi salad and hamachi kama. We ordered an abundance of skewers which we all felt need MORE time on the grill. Chicken skin was way to soft, not crispy at all! The gizzards could have used more time and salt as well. All the dishes came out pretty quick and hot. Other main dishes we had were the kambocha tempura, okonomiyaki, and yakisoba which were a ok. There are many reasons why I'd come back...decent price, friendly ambiance, and the comfort food. They just need to up the grilling time and you'd have me here everyday!...well maybe just more often than not."
"The bf and I were REALLY excited to try this place out - specifically for the ramen. Im thinking this definitely was NOT the spot to get my ramen craving in. The soup was very bland and it was just OK - was pretty disappointed.  Sure, maybe this place isn't known for the ramen - but we ordered the ginger chicken wings from the hot appetizers and got plain fried chicken. There was no ginger flavor, actually I should say that there was no flavor at all. We also ordered pork belly- which compared to the other two things was actually decent. The service WAS good - I asked for warm water for my sore throat and I was given really warm water with a lemon - so I appreciated that. Good concept...friendly people, just feel so bad to have to give a bad review as per the food. I'm guessing maybe this place is mainly for the sake (considering they had a huge selection of it)? but of course we only went for the food and maybe that was a bad choice."
"I was craving Ramen. They had Ramen - fish broth based! Yay :) it was very good. I remember them telling us that they also have gluten free (egg) noodles but not in their ramen. Also shishito peppers were ok and the mushrooms from the grill were just ok. The Japanese pancake was da bomb!!! The sauce is something else on that pancake - would have that again any day. The halibut collar was good but something was definitely missing - I can't pin point it though! Overall it was cool - new place, not packed on Sunday night, good atmosphere - small intimate place. If you're looking for a meat free base for Ramen this place works."
"Wow was this place tasty. I went with two friends last Saturday and we all really enjoyed it. We were worried about how long it would take as we had a show to make it to--not a problem at all. We were there just over an hour and got plenty to eat and plenty to drink. To start we had baby squid served 3 ways; one was delicious and fried, another was soft like oysters and tasty, and the third was whole baby squid, which I chickened out of eating; my friend devoured them, though. The Gyu sliders were incredible, the chicken skins were devoured instantly, I enjoyed the pork belly very much, and there was some sort of pizza-like dish that had breaded tuna flakes on top that was so good, our anti-seafood friend at the table heartily ate it. He was somewhat dumbstruck to find out it was seafood...can't remember the name of it though (okonoko-sonething?). There were several other dishes we tried too, pretty much everything was enjoyable.We had a really chatty, fun server, who helped us pick out a sake that was very well liked.Dinner like that for three plus drinks for total bill of $90? Yes please, I will be back."
"I came and most of the grilled items (chicken gizzards, chicken liver, buttered yuzu mushroom) were savoury and well done. It's definitely a must have to get grilled items here as everything else is pretty standard. Each skewer is about 2.50 which is pricey but considering the array of items present, it's worth it and the liver will definitely fill you up. The okonomiyaki (Japanese savory pancake) had bacon on top which I wasn't too fond off and it was a little too doughy, but definitely worth ordering. They didn't spare on the bulldog BBQ sauce on top. The takoyaki octopus balls were standard-nothing special, I had better at Wasabi where the octopus chunks are bigger and the outside was crunchier. The yakisoba with squid is also okay... Nothing different from what I can make at home. My boyfriend got the tonkatsu cutlet and said it was also average... Better tasting at mitsua food court. So this is as close to Tokyo as you can get in chi town I guess. The avocado maguro salad appetizer was tasty with ponzu and sesame oil in its marinade--also not a bad choice. The meal came with sliced pickled cucumber appetizer which was alright but negligible.We weren't happy only 2 of 13 sake options were available on the menu but we knew Mita is new and perhaps don't have any in stock yet. My friends thought the server was overwhelming sarcastic and said we ordered too much but I didn't really mind her sense of self deprecating humor."
"This place is so spot on: it's classic Japanese after work food with a stellar sake and sochu menu. Intimate and welcoming environment, the owner greeted us at the door on a cold night and smiled to say ""it's a perfect night for ramen."" Indeed. Everything we ordered was delicious - from tempura to bincho to ramen. Pork belly bincho (tare style) is a must. I'm obsessed with the fact that they have Hitachino White on tap. Selfishly I hope they don't get too popular, but I wish them all the best because this is a restaurant that is doing everything right. Kanpai, izakaya mita!"
"Alright, so not sure if the first 8 reviews are from friends or those who got a free meal on the soft opening, but here's an honest review.I'm all about supporting local business, esp in the neighborhood.  I figured this was going to be a neighborhood spot because there's not much bincho-grilling in bucktown/wicker park so I was hoping for greatness.  Unfortunately they fell short.I will give them the ""1st week, just opened"" benefit of the doubt.  Service was good, but should improve with experience/time.  The bartender didn't know his drink menu and was peeking at the ingredients, so he was slow, it was pretty obvious.  As for the food, we went for straight up bincho items mostly.  The portions are ample, which is a positive, but honestly, I'd rather small portions with great smokey flavor vs excess food that is just so-so.  Of the 5 bincho's we tried, none had an overwhelming smokey, ""I came from the bincho grill"" flavor.  The shitake mushrooms had a great marinated sweet flavor which was tasty but no bincho smoke flavor.  Also b/c they were busy, I felt everything was a bit under done, perhaps to speed up the service.  The shishitos were just not done justice!!  tasted like they were barely on the grill.  Overall for an ""izakaya"" the skewers were underwhelming!The best thing we tasted were the ebi-sliders.  It was freshly fried, the sauce was tasty and the slider rice was well seasoned.  I liked these.Also had chawanmushi, overall an okay version.  I would work on making the ingredients smaller cut and delicate.  Big chunks of food in chawanmushi don't work well, they overwhelm the delicate texture.  They were very busy, which I'm happy for, gives them room for feedback and the ability to improve.  I find it would be a great place to drink -- the sake selection is nice with options for small and large pours.  and we loved hitachino on tap!Hope to visit to see improvements.  We're all about supporting local business."
"Got to try this new place on its first day and I was completely blown away.  I have a lot of Japanese food experience, sushi, street food, ramen, udon, hibachi - I am down with all of it, but this was my first Japanese Pub experience.  The decor is top notch.  There's a little anteroom when you come in and it smells of pine with a little bit of charcoal and maybe a hint of sake.  You're sort of transported from the cold wet street to this warm cozy environment instantly.  It's wonderful.  Inside, the space is beautiful and charming.  There's lots of the usual Japanese faire with lanterns and banners with exotic graphics, but there's also a real attention to detail.  The bar is made of reclaimed wood and is a wonderful centerpiece to the pub.  The lighting is all very nice and creates a great ambiance as well.  I think things are a little packed in, but it adds to the cozy vibe, which I love.  If it was my spot, I might pull one table.The drink program is great, and I'll need to come back several times to explore everything.  There's lots of sake - which is clearly the focus of the beverage list - appropriately.  They have singles and bottles from about $20 - $200, so something for everyone.  The beer is a nice selection of Japanese drafts, and my party was very happy with the choices.  I worked on the cocktail list and was very pleased with the fairly priced drinks.  Check out the ""almost transparent blue"" - a mix of gin, sake, and magic.I was also impressed by the food.  It's setup like a tapas menu almost.  With apps, small plates, a grill selection, tempora, noodles, and some sashimi.  THIS IS NOT A SUSHI PLACE, and I really love that.  We got a number of grill items, and the stand outs were the chicken skins and chashu pork belly.  All the grill stuff was perfectly - yes perfectly - cooked and it was obvious that a seasoned master was at work behind the curtains with exotic graphics.  The tempura was fine, it had a memorable sesame soy sauce for dipping.  My table especially loved the ""pizza"" (okonomiyaki) which had pork belly and tasted like nothing I've ever experienced before.  This is a must try.  I didn't get the ramen, which is sort of my jam these days, but I will be back!Service was good - despite it being the first day.  Our waitress was friendly, attentive, and skillfully negotiating the crowds.  All the people working there are beautiful, smart, and hip - but that's Bucktown.  Thumbs up all the way.  If you want a cozy atmosphere, with some great drinks, and flavors you've never tried before, get on over to Izakaya Mita - you won't be disappointed."
"We loved this place! I travel a lot and have been to Japan dozens of times. The food here ranks as good as any I have had while in Japan. We had a large group of eight with varying tastes and interest in food, including two vegans and one shellfish allergy. Everyone loved the variety. The staff was very knowledgeable and helpful. Sake pairings were a treat. I loved the more exotic dishes, such as the Ika Shiokara (squid). The kinoko itame (mushrooms in butter sauces) is fabulous-- a must. The marinated pork belly melts in your mouth. I will make Izakaya Mita a regular stop on my visits to Chicago. If you want to try some different sakes, they will help you through suggestions and pairings."
"The food was good--I ordered ramen with pork broth and it was delicious. The handmade gyoza in particular were excellent. I would have given the place four or five stars but I dropped it down to three because the service was bad. They gave us a hard time because all three of us wanted to pay for our own food. Sounds simple, right? Not for them. After giving us the sink eye the waitress told us she was going to have to rerun everything and then took ten minutes to get us our receipts to sign. The only reason it didn't take longer was because I waived down the manager to ask why it was taking so long. It's too bad that such a good culinary experience can be scarred by a request as simple as three people wanting to pay individually for their own food."
Tried the Tonkatsu Ramen and it's fantastic! Perfect for the winter.  Great alternative to Wasabi.  Skip the long lines and taste the better Ramen!  Takoyaki is marvelous!  Mist try!
"Great food! Definitely will return. It's a busy place, so service was a little slow. But 100% will return."
