Saucy Porka
The rice bowls here pack so much flavor! We had a miso short rib bowl and a edamame shrimp bowl and they were both so flavorful and filling. Can't really go wrong here but definitely try the miso short rib for an intense flavor journey. Friendly staff to boot! Love this place
"A couple co-workers and I came here for lunch and had a tasty snack...Décor: The place is pretty cozy, only a handful of tables and a small waiting area, but the menu is big and you really have no reason for confusion before ordering (other than figuring out if the people waiting are in line to order or not). Luckily, we snagged a table and therefore got to sit while we ate. Speaking of the tables, they have Sriracha at each one - YES!Bathroom: unknownStaff: The cashier was friendly and helpful with questions and the food was prepared, and delivered right to our table, relatively quickly.Food: We each had an assortment of the Bacos, I went with one of each (there are 5 total). I would have to say that the Tofu one was quite good and the pork one was by far my favorite. The only downside to these delicious little things is that same fact: they are pretty small. Literally two-to-three bites and they are GONE. I ate all five and exclaimed, ""Well, I'm ready for 10 more..."" Also, they have free cups for water.Value: Given that each Baco is ~$3 each, and they are not large, I could go broke trying to stuff myself here...The Bacos were very, very tasty but the price is just too prohibitive of a usual lunch spot. This will be for special occasions only but I will be back for sure."
"We were so excited to try out this Asian/Latin fusion joint that my girlfriend and I literally ran from Maggie Daley park to get here before the doors closed. The hours are pretty atypical than most places, so always look them up! Needless to say, our experience was consistent with most of the reviews here. We got the Pork Ramen soup (to be honest, it had more pho like noodles than ramen like, but that didn't change the flavor), which had a delicious broth flavoring, and the spice added a nice touch as well. We also had the chorizo egg rolls with the avocado aioli which were AMAZING. The order of Asian Paella had a variety of sausages, some edamame, pork, etc, that all combine to give you a vast array of tastes and textures. And lastly we got the miso ribs with pineapple, and soy ginger bao tacos. These were incredible. The miso ribs topped with pineapples had a nice compliment of opposing flavors that worked well in combination. The soy ginger tofu bacos had a nice crunch, and the unique flavor combination paired well together. I would recommend any and all of the above. We will definitely be eating here again. And as a side note, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We came 15m before closing, and they were more than happy to allow us to sit down and eat while they closed shop. One of the employees, Jackie (Jacky, Jacki?) was full of delight and made the experience better as well."
"Saucy Porka is indeed saucy. It's also a very unique style. You have: asian with latin themes, and latin items with asian themes. As someone who enjoys all food, this fusion gets bonus points for being so unique!I had eggrolls filled with chorizo, a paella filled with what would normally be in a pho, and curried sweet potato fries which I would have certainly preferred to be a little spicier.People will mention in tips constantly ""avoid the main lunch hour rush"". They are not kidding at all. This place is moving and very busy, and very, very not a place to go at noon. Meanwhile, the food is pretty awesome and there are far more vegetarian options than I could have hoped for - even if that isn't the route I went. Staff are friendly and prices are pretty good. Definitely worth a try for all!"
"Lunch Review: Looking for a different yet tasty lunch experience. Definitely check out Saucy Porka.The good: Amazing food, especially for lunch options. The rib was cooked very tenderly and sauced just right. Lots of different and fun options to choose from. The prices are average for lunch in downtown. Service was fast and friendly.The bad: Not a whole lot of seating to choose from. If you blink, you might walk right past the restaurant, it's sort of hidden. No bigger tables. Atmosphere: 8/10Service: 9/10Food: 9/10"
"Great hidden, small, downtown lunch spot with expected limited seating and a crowd. Most tables seat up to 4 guests. Chorizo egg roll, Braised Beef short rib bao, Asian style Paella, and for the Bahn Mi: Saucy Porka, Domo Arigato Bahn, Cubano are all solid choices. Being a ramen fanatic, of course I had to try the Pork ramen and found it more like Vietnamese Pho style than ramen, but very tasty with an excellent broth. Wished they reversed their hours and were open past 4:00 for dinner (i.e. 11:00a - 7:00p)."
"I heard this was a pretty popular lunch spot from coworkers for a while so a few weeks into my new job one of them took me here to grab lunch during a weekday. There was no line which apparently was very out of the ordinary. I got the asian style paella to go, which came out within 5 minutes. It was pretty good! It was really filling - they definitely didn't skimp on the meats. I really liked the spicy sausage and carnitas, the chinese sausage tasted really authentic, and the edamame + bean sprouts added another dimension to it all. It was basically fried rice but I'm not complaining! It was really flavorful in many different ways, depending on what was in each bite. I also added the spicy sauce that they gave me on the side which made it just the perfect amount of spicy. I was very satisfied and would definitely come back here for a quick, delicious, filling lunch."
"Saucy Porka continues to be one of the best spots in the loop for a great lunch, although I try not to get it too often given most of the options can be a bit heavy (or, because I have a deadly affinity for their sweet potatoes fries...  you choose).As many have said, pretty much everything here is great.  The steam buns, the egg rolls, the fries, the bowls, etc.  I've yet to have something I thought was bad.It can be a bit hectic if you arrive in the heat of lunch rush hour (an organized line never really does form and, when you're waiting for your food to come out, there really is no refuge from the flux of people coming in and going out).  Try to hit it around 1130 or 1 and you're golden."
"Great place to spot for lunch. They have different savory Asian fusion options that range from Western inspired bahn mi sandwiches, kimchi fries, and savory meats served in white soft Asian baos. The Cubano was very well put together with a juicy, well marinated pork filling. My favorite part was picked onions that came with it: sweet and tangy without any of the normal spicy punch you get from eating raw onion. Instead you'll be crying tears of joy from this delicious combinations of flavors in your mouth. The Spicy Porka was also delicious with kimchi and juicy pork. It's not very spicy at all so make sure to add lots of siracha if you like it hot! The kimchi was also very done, all leafy tender parts and none of the super thick base of the cabbage that it hard to eat. Last thing to note, the staff here is super friendly and nice! I was exploring the city and doing the normal touristy walking things. Due to poor foresight, I was wearing new sandals and was starting to get blisters on my feet. The staff was kind"
"Simply. Awesome.I've visited Chicago a number of times, and the beauty of such a large city is that there is always something new popping up.Located in the southwest corner of the Loop, Saucy Porka serves up a fantastic fusion of Asian and Latin cuisine. The bao tacos, or bacos as they are called, have a fluffy outer bun and a delicious filling, such as curry chicken or pork carnitas. The sweet potato fries, which are normally pretty awesome, are taken to another level thanks to the curry aioli. The banh mi offerings are no slouch either. I'm not sure I would call carnitas served with kimchi a banh mi in the traditional sense, but it's still a nice and unique combination of flavors. Service was superfast, and the gentleman behind the counter was quick to offer advice on what to eat. A definite must-eat place in Chicago!"
"Smack in the middle of a busy area, this place was packed when we walked in for lunch. We had the Short Rib Baco, Chorizo Egg Roll and Saucy Porka. The baos are freaking AMAZING! Even if you're not hungry and stumble upon this place, get a baco! Saucy Porka is super flavorful and a pretty decent size sandwich. The chorizo egg rolls was such a yummy good choice and chalked full of chorizo! It's even better smothered in the avocado aioli that comes with it. Finding a seat may be super hard, so you can just grab it to go and sit somewhere outside, like the park."
"YUM! The only thing I would change about this place is that they would be open for dinner and weekends and all the time. :) Saucy Porka is the perfect blend of fusion food - highlighting the best parts of each type of cuisine. Definitely recommend the Asian Paella, that was definitely my favorite part of the meal. The bacos were fun and the prices were your typical lunch fare prices in downtown.The space was clean, the service was great, and it is great for a speedy lunch. Usual customers are businesspeople from the nearby offices. I've had my fair share of bad fusion food so I am glad to know Saucy Porka continues to make some of the best."
"Ok, this place rocks for lunch.  Great menu, cool quirky combinations.  And really delicious food.I'm not exactly sure how I'd describe the place - its a fusion sandwich place (with ramen, bao,and a few other options) with Korean, Chinese,Japanese, and Puerto Rican anchors.  The Saucy Porka sandwich is really fantastic - pork carnitas with kimchi!.  I wasn't able to try other dishes, but I guarantee I'll be back soon to"
"Went in during lunch time. I'm always up for Fusion foods. It was around 12 pm, so all the tables were packed and more people were coming in to order To go. Even so, I was able to get out of there in less than ten minutes. (Quick service) The guy making the food addressed everyone by their names and was all smiles despite the crazy rush inside the store. I was impressed! I tried a Miso Braised Rib Baco and a Thai Curry Chicken Baco To go. The guy at the counter offered Sriracha on the side. Bacos are full of meat! Thai Curry was a little spicy. Definitely not unbearable, but it had a kick. Personally I thought was OK, but I can see people liking it depending on your taste preferences. The Miso Braised Rib was really nice! I would've liked it better with rice I think because it was so dense. It reminded me of Korean pulled Ribs. On the sweeter side. I liked this one better. There is a rice bowl for this one. Might be something to try next time.One note though, I tried the bun seperately without the meat, and I couldn't taste anything. Maybe it was because the meat had so much flavor, but I wished there would've been some sweet/saltiness on it.  Worth trying."
"Although I have lived in Chicago all my life, I have never ventured into the Financial District side until my new job. I quickly learned that not only was maneuvering around the large commuter crowds overwhelming, the lines for lunch around this area is total chaos. Long lines and hungry people...Bad combo.During lunch one day, I decided to find a place along a road that seemed less taken. At first I thought it was an alley, but to my surprise it was actually a street! Tucked in the corner away from the hustle and bustle is a barely noticeable sign of a joint called Saucy Porka. Unsure of what I was getting myself into,  I entered the place, and was immediately welcomed by the cashiers along with the fairly large group of people. Some of whom looked like regulars, who eagerly pushed through to the front, while others like me, stood in the back, trying to take in the large menu as we try to look around to see what everyone else was ordering.Oh boy this menu! Listed on a chalkboard was a list of item I would have never fathom existed. On this one of a kind menu, all my eyes were drawn to BACOS. What in the world are bacos?! Just my luck, instead of tortillas, it is substituted with baos, which is like a steam bun. The line moved fairly quick, and next thing I knew I was next in line. With eyes bigger than my stomach, I wanted to say one of each please, but I knew I wouldn't be able to finished, so I settled for 3 tacos - Thai Chicken Curry, Miso Braised Beef Short Rib, and Soy Ginger Tofu, and a half order of their Curry Sweet Potato Fries. To my surprise, the order came out fairly quick. Of the 3 bacos, my favorite was the short rib. So much flavor! That pineapple salsa! People, you need to get on that! As for the fries, probably one of the best fries I have ever had. The curry aioli sauce got to me. They were crispy on the outside which seems like is hard to get that texture with sweet potato fries without burning it.Anyways, for a small little asian girl like me 3 bacos and a half order of fries was plenty! Stuffed and satisfied, this $15 lunch was a bit steep, but the experience was worth while."
"The pork taco was better than the chicken, if one twisted my arm to choose. Both were delicious.  The hint of cinnamon in the bun balanced all the savory and complimented the sweet of the mango. Curry fries were tasty and ultimately a delicious sauce delivery method.  The banana Nutella binges delightfully capped off the meal."
"Was in Chicago for work and staying at the JW Marriott around the corner. I had less than an hour for lunch and so I needed something fast and casual, but also delicious.Yelped within 0.3 miles and highest rated... Saucy Porka was at (or near) the top. I don't recall, but I saw Asian Fusion and that they had Banh Mi's and within seconds I knew I must partake.I entered pretty set on a Banh Mi, and I'm not a big fan of Bao buns. I live in Texas. I want my tacos in a tortilla.I asked the (very friendly) gentleman behind the counter and he recommended the Domo Arigato (miso braised beef short ribs served on French baguette topped with a pickled Asian slaw). My colleague ordered the The Saucy Porka (pork carnitas served on French baguette topped with kimchi) and an order of Curry Sweet Potato Fries (topped with queso fresco cheese served with curry aioli) to share.There was only one table available (it was very crowded and a constant flow of people) so we sat and received our food within minutes. Awesome, but also key given the lunch rush.I hastily bit into my sandwich and oh what a delight...Yes, it's a bit expensive given the size, but it is short rib after all.  I completely agree with reviewer Cat G. who said, ""the meat was perfectly braised, tender, and flavorful, and the acidity of the slaw was a good complement to the richness of short rib. Finally - and this is crucial - THE AMOUNT OF BREAD WAS IN PROPORTION TO THE FILLING."" I will say that, in my opinion, it could've used some heat. I'm used to the ever welcome presence of jalapenos on my Banh Mi's. I guess, as others here have indicated, I could've thrown a dab Sriracha on there to make the taste buds tingle.I also tried my colleague's Saucy Porka (the restaurants namesake) and was equally impressed. I might've even preferred it. The curry sweet potato fries were delicious as well.[SUMMARY]: Quick, friendly service and delicious food. No complaints on any of the items I tried. Have I had better Banh Mi's? Sure, but it was fast, hot, different and did I mention delicious? Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a quick and delicious Asian Fusion lunch experience."
"The egg rolls were recommended to me, and I will say they lived up. I also had the Asian Paella. The Asian Paella was a bit salty so be prepared to hit the coke machine a few times.  I went during lunch and ordered take out, but the food was prepared quickly and everyone was friendly.  I think this place is worth another visit."
"5 coworkers decided to venture out this sunny day and all 5 got something different and all 5 were delightfully satisfied. I love the unique creativeness of the menu - makes it hard to pick something. I totally forgot about this place for 2 yrs (shame on me!). I remember liking the bao tacos. I have tired the saucy porka sandwich but I recall it being a bit messy since it is loaded with pork and kimchi goodness.This time I tired the Asian paella. OMG - for me it was rice ""crack"". that flavor in the rice had some childhood familiarity from visits to southern india. I wish I knew what makes that flavor. all the meats in the rice were delicious! mmm....sausage :P Other people had the chorizo eggroll, a variety of bacos, the arroz con pork, the pork pho noodle, the short rib sandwich. everyone liked their food The service was uber friendly and accommodating. can't wait to go back. Hope they open a spot in Old Town!!"
"My favorite lunch spot in the loop. Very cheap, tasty, filling. I love their sweet potato fries with scallions and cheese, their ginger soy tofu, and their nutella/banana beignets. This gem has mastered the art of keeping asian fusion affordable and delicious. I can't stand places that have such high markups on asian fusion food. Their paella is also solid and their baos are pillowy soft. Their space is kind of cramped but the food is well worth the slight discomfort."
"not really sure why it has this many positive reviews. the place itself is cute and the wait staff is quick and efficeint. I tried the toru baco and i didnt like it as much, I will get the pork if I go back. And the vietnamese coffee. I tried the beef and that was a lot better, with good flavors and pineapple on the top. I got the curly fries as well but didnt like the curry that it came with, the fries were good, the scallions add a nice touch to them. Not really out of this world, but nice addition to the meal. I think i might come back for breakfast some day, those options sound better than the ones I had for lunch"
"Oh my goodness this place was amazing. I meant to write a review as soon as I got back from Chicago, but it's highly likely I've been in a food coma ever since. So... the bacos. Such a novel concept and so incredibly yummy. The Miso Short Rib Baco was what dreams are made of. DREAMS, I'm telling you!!! I believe I had a pork carnita baco as well which was yummy, but see above, miso short rib, dream, etc.I also had a side of the chorizo egg rolls which were heavy but delicious, and delivered quite a kick that I wasn't really expecting! My spice tolerance is incredibly high so nothing fazes me anymore and I wasn't expecting much out of chorizo, but damn this was good.In case you haven't figured this out already, just a PSA--you WILL be in a food coma immediately after you scarf down your meal."
"I saw the menu and I had to stop by on my visit to Chicago! I was not very hungry when I came (already had lunch) but decided to have a second lunch since the items seemed small anyways.I started with the Chorizo Egg Roll. This was good and unique. I liked the avocado aioli, but I wouldn't say this is as mind blowing as other reviews make it out to be.Then, I ordered the Miso Braised Beef Short Rib baco. This was really good! The short rib was very soft and just falls apart in your mouth like it should. The marinade is yummy too and I really liked the pineapple salsa to complement it.I wasn't hesitant about getting dessert but I really wanted to try the Azuki Beignet. This was definitely a miss for me. The beignets weren't soft and fluffy as I had imagined - but I guess I am spoiled after visiting Cafe du Monde in New Orleans. The dough seemed a bit dry.Service was very friendly though and the place was busy!"
"Short rib. SHORT RIB. short riiiiib. My god, that beef is so tender and juicy and fatty and all the things that beef should be but never is. I got the Miso Braised Short Rib rice bowl (with a fried egg as per the owner's suggestion). That first bite of the beef just melts in your mouth and the sauce goes great with the coconut rice and the veggies. They musta slow-cooked the crap out of those short ribs because I haven't had beef that tender in awhile. Also, got the pork carnitas ""baco"". Deserves an honorable mention but to be honest, I love anything with hum baos. You could probably put in a shoe in a humbao and I would still eat it. Everyone's really friendly and I talked with Michael, the owner, and asked him how he came up with this Asian-Latin Fusion concept and he talked about how global food really is. Super friendly and even gave me some suggestions on other places to try while I'm in town. I'm a Seattleite so I probably won't have a chance to develop an addiction here but solid food, friendly staff - you really can't go wrong here!"
Had Pork Ramen Soup and Chorizo Egg Roll for lunch. The crispy Egg Roll reminded me Chinese Spring Roll and the fresh Ramen Soup a little bit similar to Pho. It is a typical Asian American restaurant. Next time I wanna try their the other signature dish -- Saucy Porka! Good service.
"Great, interesting Asian-Latin fusion. I had the tacos which were awesome. I'd recommend the pork and chicken. The service was great and the staff was friendly and helpful."
"Omg i feel I'm addicted to this place bc I crave it, it's soo good. I love all the sauce/dip options along with good short ribs and the best egg rolls ever--- seriously the best! I love this concept, all the food is fresh, cheap and the staff is so sweet. I wish they had more locations."
"Domo Arigato. 2 stars.Short rib texture was on point for sure but it was way too salty. It just destroyed everything. It was like chewing soy sauce. Even if it was less salty, the sandwich as a whole did not wow me. The flavor was just okay.Why I bumped it too 3 stars was because the workers there are amazing! They were all super friendly and helpful. They knew the names of the regulars too. I had a nice little conversation with the older man who I believe is the owner.I need to come back and try their other items but I'm going to stay away from the short rib."
"While staying at the top of One Financial Place this has become a go to.  The people that work here regularly already know it.  And good luck trying to kick the habit.As with most food trucks that became famous and the founder reached her or his dream of a restaurant this is a pleasant happy place where there will quickly remember the regulars and greet you by name.  I do happen to be mildly educated on tacos (understatement) and this take on Latin / Asian Fusion works so well that it's hilarious.  Who would have thunk of wrapping succulent carnitas, Thai chicken, ribs, etc. in a fluffy lovely fresh hot bun ""tortilla""?  Apparently her name is Amy and she's famous in the media and local food culture.  Met her twice and only said hi as I don't want to bother her and don't know what to say other than I love this place and the food will create a lifetime memory, fast and cheap.Wish they were open at night as I would be over there right now."
"Took me way too long to write a review for Saucy Porka, been coming here for lunch for several years.  Not working for CHI comp anymore I didn't realize how much I missed until today.  Literally everything here is amazing including the service!   Some of my favs, the Asian Paella is perfect and will leave you both wanting more and in a wonderful food coma.  The Pork Ramen is fantastic, esp on a cold CHI day.  Of the Bacos, my favs are the Carnitas, Thai Curry and Short Rib.Again, service is awesome, food is perfect and it is top 5 of all spots for me in CHI."
"Bacos, bacos, bacos!Came here on an insanely cold Chiberia lunch break. Things to do when you're here:-Immediately claim a table. They're scarce during lunch. -Eat bacos. Order an extra one. You will want more later and they'll still taste good.(I LOVE the tofu, hubby loves short rib one)-Share sweet potato fries with someone. They will pay this good deed forward.-Repeat every time you're in the loop. I wish I worked in the loop for a number of reasons, Saucy Porka being one of them. Day-dreaming of escaping  work one of these days just for one (or 6) tofu bacos. *drool*"
"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now, and I'm so glad I chose today! The menu had so many options that sounded great, it was hard to choose! We went with sweet potato fries and chorizo egg rolls to start--both of which were fabulous. The sauces both came with were irresistible. Next we had the miso short rib rice bowl and curry chicken baos which we also couldn't get enough of. The staff was very friendly and educated on their menu which I always enjoy. We will definitely be back here soon."
"It was okay, somewhat too strong of flavor."
"This place has a great/fantastic sample of new flavorful food.  I love the combination of asian and mexican style.  The only minor disappointment was that the portion of food was tiny - something I should have expected considering the low price of each item, but still, not advertised well. Tip: arrive 30 minutes before the lunch hour, or else you will be in line forever!"
"Really great place for a fast lunch in the loop! If you want to sit down, there is space to do so; otherwise, you can order take out quickly and efficiently. As a vegetarian, their edamame and tofu rice bowl seemed like the safest option -- but it was an incredibly delicious option. Super filling, really delicious, and reasonable prices. The staff is also laid back and handles the lunch rush really well."
"Tried their signature Saucy Porka Banh Mi and was not impressed. I've had much better Banh Mi, even nearby. I'll be back to Saucy Porka, as the service and friendliness is impeccable- and other menu items are more to my liking!"
"I had their carnitas and beef short rib baco's, and was not impressed. To salty and similar. Definitely not worth my $2.75 & $3.50. Unfortunately since these items were the only things I got during lunch, my experience was not the best so try the other items, but the baco's are off the list of things to get imo.As for the spot, it's pretty small & seating can be troublesome unless you come at the right time and with a small group."
Great lunch spot! I highly recommend the spare rib bacos and the sweet potato fries. Try to get there a little before noon as it gets really crowded. There is limited seating as well.
"Great spot in the southern portion of the Loop.  A nice way to mix up the lunch routine. Great options, friendly staff and the prices are reasonable for the portion size."
This place is pretty damn good. Excuse my French. I was skeptical when the owner recommend I get the most expensive thing on the menu... The rice bowl w/ a fried egg on top for extra $. Boy was I in awe of how good the food was. Is savored every bite. Boy do I want to go back right now and eat another bowl.
Great lunch option. Its a lot more filling than it seems. Came with coworkers a little ahead of the lunch crowd and had no problems getting a table and enjoying it right at the place. Short ribs bao - delicious. Tender. Flavorful and loaded with meat topped with pineapple pieces. Will get again.Shrimp bao - extremely fresh shrimp with a bounce! A lot lighter than the ribs but still very enjoyable. My tip would be to eat this one first because the other one is bolder.Curry fries - perfection. Just get it. The manager came over and made sure we liked everything and actually suggested the tofu one for next time. We are coming back for sure.
Stopped by for a quick lunch while I was in the area. Cute shop and fun fusion menu. The kimchi nachos were awesome! Service was also friendly and helpful.
"I came here with a friend for lunch this past Friday and we made sure to beat the lunch rush by leaving the office at 11am. I normally eat early but I had read that this place had limited seating so it was even more important to get here early. When we walked in, no one was in line to order or seated at the tables yet...score!The man at the cashier greeted us politely and even commented on which items to order from their extensive chalkboard menu. The lady next to him also recommended getting 2-3 bacos along with an appetizer so we happily obliged and ordered on the high-end cuz YOLO (is that still a thing?)!And in case you're wondering, a baco is a mix between a taco and those bao buns you can get from Chinese restaurants or places like Wow Bao. Basically, they use a bao bun and fill it up like a taco. Yum!I ordered the miso braised beef short rib, pork carnitas and Thai chicken curry bacos supplemented by a chorizo egg roll appetizer. All for about $14 with tax...not too bad.We picked a two-person table - the type you normally see at bars with the high stools - and sat by the window to take in the sun on this nice Fridayyyyy. They brought out food to us - identical orders cuz who doesn't like to copy someone else when you can't decide on your own. Though, of course, I was the trailblazer in this rodeo.Whoever invented this taco with bao bun combination is a genius, cuz these were delicious! The carnitas and short rib were my personal favorite and the chorizo egg rolls which come with an avocado dip were equally delicious! If you're looking for a taco fix but also craving some baos, look no further cuz you found your paradise! Just come early like we did cuz when we left around noon, the place was packed with no seats available and a bit of a line to order food that was nearing the door. I'll definitely be back for more!"
"Went during the lunch rush. Saucy Porka was filled with loyal fans and guys in suits. The line moved quickly and the food cam out fast. The guy putting the food together ( young, Asian male) was super energetic, charismatic, and friendly! :) I had the Miso Braised Short Rib Baco, Sofrito Shrimp Baco,and Chorizo Egg Rolls. All I could say is yum yum yum. If you are in the area, stop by :) You'll love it."
Easily my favorite lunch in the loop. I'd eat the Asian paella with a fried egg and double meat everyday if I could. Give it a shot !
"My friend and I went HAM on this place yesterday.I LOVE that this concept opened in Chicago. I had yet to find a place that focused on a modern spin on baos. We got an assortment of items:- BACOS: Shrimp, Miso Short Rib, Pork Carnita, Soy Ginger Tofu, Thai Chicken Curry- Chorizo Egg Roll- Sweet Potato Fries (Large)- Azuki Cinnamon Beignets- Banana Nutella BeignetsThe bacos were great. A good size. I got over zealous and ordered 4. I think 3 will suffice for any normal appetite. I suggest the shrimp and Miso Short Rib. The shrimp was light and fresh and the miso short rib had tender pieces of meat. That slaw on top is amazing! A great balance to the short rib.Chorizo egg rolls were okay, nothing spectacular, however, the advocado dipping sauce that comes with it was SO GOOD. The sweet potato fries were perfect, thick and crispy. The curry aoili was a great compliment, not too curry tasting.I wouldn't suggest getting the beignets. They weren't the light fluffy kinds, more so hard and doughy. I suggest getting the azuki (red bean) beignet over the banana nutella. I coudln't taste the banana and it was overall too sweet. The azuki was just the right amount of sweetness.Overall B+! Great concept, good execution, however I would skip out on the chorizo egg rolls and beignets.I want to come back to try the bahn mis.Also, its small inside, we went around 1pm and it was pretty clear. I don't suggest going around noon. It also closes at 4pm and is only open during the weekdays. :( The staff there was knowledgeable and SUPER friendly! An awesome vibe :)"
"1. WARNING- If you're considering this place for mid-week lunch (come extra early or late, the place is VERY popular and gets super packed quickly)2. DELICIOUS ""Bacos"" (bao tacos)3. Loved the crispy egg rolls4. Very small venue, but clean and friendlyBeing new to working downtown, I had to rely on Yelp (of course!) to decide on a lunch venue.  Came across this gem and so glad I did.  I ordered 3 ""bacos""; their version of tacos made of bao bun (think bbq pork bun plushness in the shape of a tortilla in tacos) with deliciousness in the middle.  Loved my selection: pork carnitas topped with pineapple salsa, thai chicken curry topped with pickled Asian slaw, and miso braised beef short rib.  These three were more than enough for a filling and super tasty lunch.  I could order these every day for the remainder of the week and not be tired of them.  My friend ordered bacos also, but added an order of vegetarian egg rolls and those were cooked to a perfect crispyness and filled with a blend of sweet potato, carrots, onions, mushrooms and with a side of a mojo dipping sauce.  Plenty more delicious options on the menu, so I'll be returning to try more.  Looking forward to the chorizo egg roll, tostones (twice fried plantains topped with pineapple salsa & red curry coconut aioli), Banh Mi sandwiches, and the one I will probably order first is the Asian style paella.  HIGHLY recommend it, you have to try this place at least once."
"This place is nice. The staffs are friendly. The food is good. I ordered the sweet potatoes fries, it was really good. I like the Ginger tofu bacos, the Thai Chicken curry wasn't my taste. I'm going to try other bacos next time."
"This place is amazing!  The food is delicious and the service is so friendly!  I am definitely a fan of this restaurant obviously.  Working in the loop in downtown Chicago, there are the typical chain restaurants to try, but this place is a gem in the area.  I bring all of my co-workers and friends to eat here for lunch.  The menu is asian/latin fusion with very strong flavors.  I usually order the bacos or the bahn mi sandwiches.  The short ribs are marinated with such flavor.  Their Chorizo Egg Rolls are addicting and add the avocado aioli sauce to it, yes I said avocado aioli.  Yum!  Their ramen is so savory.  Their Service is very friendly, the people there know me by name now and gives me a hug each time I go in.  Beware, at around lunch hour it does get packed so anticipate longer lines.  But service goes by fairly quick.  They try to get your food to you as fast as they can.  You have to try it for yourself but it is a must stop shop in Chicago in my books.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"
"WHY DIDN'T ANYONE TELL ME TO GO HERE UNTIL NOW.Seriously, holy crap, I'm blown away. I'm usually a food truck girl for my lunch break, but today none of my favorites were parked anywhere near my office. Since this almost never happens and I'd had Saucy Porka on my to-try list for a while, I decided to take advantage of the lull to pay them a visit. I walked in at around 11:30 and there was barely any line, which was nice - I'm sure they get very busy around peak lunch hours, and it's a pretty small place, so I'd recommend going around 11:30 or maybe 1:30. Service was friendly and efficient.I ordered the Domo Arigato banh mi, which is a sub-like sandwich on a French baguette containing miso-braised beef short ribs and an Asian slaw. Read: amazingness. The meat was perfectly braised, tender, and flavorful, and the acidity of the slaw was a good complement to the richness of short rib. Finally - and this is crucial - THE AMOUNT OF BREAD WAS IN PROPORTION TO THE FILLING. Unheard of, I know. Most banh mis I've eaten have had too much bread in comparison to the amount of meat inside, but this one was packed with filling and the bread was still crispy and held its own. My one complaint is that the sauce was leaking out of the banh mi and its paper wrapper by the time I got back to my office with it, but a few napkins and some careful handling of the sandwich fixed that.I know they specialize in pork dishes, but I'm in the midst of what appears to be a perpetual love affair with beef short ribs. That being said, I don't at all mind an extra excuse to come back for lunch soon, because I'm certain that Saucy Porka just knocked a food truck out of my top 5 places to eat lunch in the Loop."
"Delicious! I love Saucy Porka's food and the flavor they manage to create. Their ramen is always hit and we get it every time we stop by. It's a must try! The mean is so tender and mixes so well with the broth, jalapenos and cilantro. I also tried their rice bowls, and they are also very good. Last time I had the Cubana sandwich, and I have nothing bad to say about their flavor meat and perfectly toasted bread. Chorizo eggrolls and bacos are very good as well. Service is prompt and they are so attentive! Overall, I believe you can't go wrong with any of their dishes and that is making me a religious fan of their food!"
"As a recent Cuban transplant from Miami, I was super pleased with my meal at Sausy Porka. I had the tostones with mango/pineapple topping and mojo sauce to share, and the arroz con edamame and curry chicken. The Asian elements add a nice kick to the normally tame Cuban food. Overall, great lunch."
"My friend raves about this place all the time. Finally made it there a few months back after I took my GRE since I typically don't eat out for lunch on work days and it is a 15-20 minute walk from my office. I ordered the Domo Arigato on my friend's recommendation and really enjoyed it even after hearing about how great it was. Definitely want to make it back sometime to try out their menu (seriously, there's so many options and I basically want to try everything)."
"We became fans of this place not only because of the food, but because of the amazing customer service. We met Amy, the owner, and she was very nice and got to know us and about our stay in the city. I'd say my favorite food there would have to be the Miso Braised Beef Short Rib baco. The flavor was great and the bun was very soft.   I tried the Pork Ramen Soup and even the half size was huge. The broth was so good, hot and perfect a cold day. I also liked the Asian Style Paella because of the two types of sausages they put in there. I wish we had the stomach to try more bacos; looks like that will be saved for our next trip!"
"This place is really good, and a great spot to grab lunch during the work week. I recommend the Sofrito Marinated Shrimp baco, and the Miso Braised Beef short rib baco.  The chorizo egg rolls were ok, not great."
"I am glad that have added Saucy Porka to my lunch rotation.  I am not a religious man, but if God has a taste, it is probably Saucy Porka's Bao tacos.  Which one you ask?  All of them.  I usually order two Thai Chicken Curry, one short rib, and one carnitas.  My only complaint is they are not located closer to my home!"
"The ramen is fantastic and perfect for the winter, and you really get a lot.  The tacos, while tasty, are not overly filling.Stick with the ramen and you won't go wrong.305/365"
"The place was really popular! We Waited 5mins to get seated. Service was good and food was fast and cheap. We tried the chorizos sausage egg roll, sweet potato fries,three bacos  and one saucy porka. The egg roll, bacos, porka were good but not impressive. But we both loved the fries, crunchy and sweet. It tasted even better with the free avocado dip and curry dip! Those dipping sauces were awesome! There was also one big cup of ice tea coming with our meal. Recommended for quick lunch both dine in or take out."
"Re: the menu -- I've tried almost everything now and out of all that I've tried, I highly recommend the Miso Short Rib Baco, the Saucy Porka Banh Mi, and the Pork Ramen Soup. Hands down, the bacos are unique and you need to try them. If you get any of these three dishes, you will be in food-heaven - guaranteed. If it's a Monday and you're feeling guilty about indulging over the weekend, try the Beet Salad-- it's delicious and guilt-less.Saucy Porka is located in Financial Place, conveniently right next to my office. I probably come here at least once a week now. It's a a small place, but there are a few tables and people come and go quickly. At the strike of noon, the place has a huge line so I recommend coming at 11:45am. Regardless, the staff and servers are so friendly and very efficient at taking orders."
"5 for what it is - good fast, tasty, and fun.  I just love the name - who would not want to eat at a place called Saucy Porka - Asian - Latin fusion.  Quick service, friendly, serving lunch only.Carnitas Bao Taco is steamed rice cake flat with carnitas and corn. Very tasty - light and substantial - all at the same time.  The Miso shortrib style was also very good - though I think the Carnitas was my preference.The egg rolls are crispy and substantial -they resist falling apart. The dipping sauces are a tasty addition and make them complete. The veggie was good, but the chorizo is the clear winner.Run for lunch to Saucy Porka - quick, tasty, and some new flavors."
"good food, everything cooked fresh ; had the curry sweet potato fries were excellent.  Enjoyed the sticky bun tacos, three different types that were unusual and goodalso tried the ramen soup, hit the spot on a cold day"
"Service was great, very helpful.Curry sweet potato fries were pretty good.Carnitas and shrimp baco weren't bad.The red bean ""beignet"" was not worth the money though.I don't know if I'd go again, and it might just be me, but in my opinion Saucy Porka's food isn't as great as it's hyped up to be."
"Great lunch spot! The short rib bacos, sweet potato frys and chorizo egg rolls are a must! Not much room for seating so go after 1pm or take it to go. Great customer service."
"This place exceeded all my expectations. We came around noon, the line was out the door which is a great sign. I had Basil Chicken Salad ($7). The chicken was shredded and very flavorful. Really good dressing. The staff is friendly. Will definitely be back for more!"
Decent food. Very few vegetarian option but I liked the tofu rice bowl. Unfortunately they got my order wrong the 3 times I visited. I like to support small business and it is very disappointing that they do not even provide a printed receipt and provide incorrect orders. Each time there was lot of confusion and I never got the promised partial refund for the hassle. Employees are friendly but they need to hire couple of workers. The person who takes order is also responsible for cleaning the table and another person who fulfills to go orders also act as server. The food is not cheap and a meal would cost $13 with taxes. I expect good service and good food for that price at a fast food restaurant.
"My husband loved this place! His favorite was the chorizo egg rolls, they were amazing with the green sauce!! The kimchi and pork sandwich was excellent, it even came with some really good chips which were very favorable! Definitely recommend coming here for those that love meat!"
"While it was a bit of a trip/walk (causing the other half to be hangry at me), the food was everything we expected and more. We tried a sampling of everything - chorizo egg rolls, curry sweet potato fries, thai chicken curry bao taco (or baco as they call it), miso short rib baco and Ho Chi Minh Banh Mi (curry chicken and Asian slaw). It was all delicious!We usually come to town a couple times a year and stay just outside the loop so this will be a place we come to grab lunch on that annual trip. Worth the walk (but only open for lunch)"
"Just went in for the first time for lunch today. I loved it! I got a chicken taco, tofu taco, and a Ho chi ming  Tofu sandwich. I spent about $14. I like the soft white bun they use for the taco. And I definitely prefer tofu over chicken in this place. The chicken was pretty normal but the tofu is very good! So if you ever debate between chicken or tofu I would say tofu (unless you really want your meat). My friend got a short rib rice bowl. It was a decent size and it's definitely filling. The place has about 9 tables, it's pretty busy during lunch hour so I recommend going after lunch rush if you hate to wait in line. People there are very nice and helpful. I would totally go back."
"The Latin Asian fusion fare is translated very literally here...tacos wrapped in Chinese baos, eggrolls filled with chorizo, paella with Chinese sausage.  Food was overall quite nice. The curried sweet potato fries were crispy and you certainly can't have just one. But I found the dusting of granulated sugar to be slightly offputting with the other flavors. The chorizo eggrolls were interesting. I had the braised short rib rice bowl, which is a hearty and large lunch option. The braised short rib is like a Chinese pot roast meat, sweet savory and caramelized by soy and sugar. The coconut rice, napa, and radish pickles were also a great companion to the rice and short rib. Delicious for sure, but I found it to be a little too heavy halfway through. Next time, I'll try the bao tacos or the ramen. For lunch this is a solid choice. Choose whether to pick up an order, take it to-go, or try your hand at snatching up one of the dozen tables. It definitely gets pretty busy in here, but the service is fast and very friendly."
"I'm giving 4 stars for the service.  It's top notch for a pseudo-fast food place.  My friend and I came in during the lunch rush and ordered to-go.While waiting, we managed to score a table.  The guy behind the counter found us and brought us our meals w/ a side of sriracha and came by to check on us mid-way through.  The meal itself was a little too saucy, not enough porka for my taste.  I got the miso short rib, and I think it would've been better w/ half the sauce.  Or more rice.Despite that, I'd come back and try the other selections.  Especially since the service was so legit."
Great food!  Great customer service!  Quick lunch!  Inexpensive!  The Soy Ginger Tofu Baco was my favorite!
"Great first experience at Saucy Porka. Went there based on great yelp reviews and they didn't disappoint.Tried a Ho Chi Minh Banh Mi sandwich with tofu, which was great. The bread is awesome - melts in your mouth. The sauce that comes with the tofu is really good. It's this dark sweet and sour sauce with tons of flavor.We also had a rice bowl called Arroz con Edamame also with Tofu. So the tofu preparation and sauce is exactly the same as the sandwich. That's the one thing I'd say about the options here is I wish there was some more variety for vegetarian options. I mean, they have the sandwich, the rice bowl, and a baco too, but the tofu is the same across the board. Well, at least they do have one great option.Next time I do want to try the baco. Also, the egg rolls and curry fries look good too. Look forward to my next trip to Saucy Porka."
"My friends and I went to visit Chicago back in August and this was our first destination. We had the pho ramen, which I definitely recommend, and the pork buns, and egg rolls. Everything here sounded and looked really appetizing! The staff here is also super friendly and were willing to explain all the menu items to us.Since we were visitors we asked them about what to do and see in the city, and they recommended some great places. Please go check this place out! It was our favorite restaurant during our few days in Chicago!"
"Every time I come here I am never disappointed. I think I have tried almost everything on their menu and I can't pick a favorite (because they're all my favorite!) but i must recommend their curry sweet potato fries. It's so flavorful, crisp, and soft at the same time. On a cold day, their pork ramen soup is an instant winner. And as always, their bacos are on point."
"If they were to ever take their Arroz con Edamame dish from off the meal, then i would literally start crying now. Thats how much i love this place, especially this dish. Its puerta rican rice with edamame and you can choose curry chicken, braised pork or tofu. I usually get with the curry chicken and i walk out of there spending $9 each time. Absolutely amazing dish that i eat atleast twice a week. Their Bao tacos are extremely good as well. Full of flavor, but also very small and pretty pricey. I am usually not full after 3, and at that point ive spent $10, which is why i avoid getting them as frequently, but they are really good though. Their vegetarian egg roles are a true HIT as well. The outside of the egg role is extremely cripsy and tastes like they make it from scratch instead of the normal frozen ones that people just heat up. Tastes really good. Overall a very good choice to eat, but i always get my food to go. If you want to dine in for lunch, you have to go between 1130-11:45, otherwise any later then you will be waiting a while for someone to leave. There are only about 15 tables, and the restaurant is pretty small, so that is why i advise calling your food in like me so you can quickly pick up and be out of there."
The employees (and maybe owner?) were super friendly and fun to talk to. It's a tiny spot and only open on the weekdays. We had the tostones and chorizo egg rolls to start. I LOVED the chorizo egg rolls! The tostones were good as well. The pork carnitas and short rib bacos were both good. I enjoyed the pork carnitas better however. We tried both beignets...they're not your traditional beignets but still delicious. I want to try the ramen next time!
"We came for Saucy Porka's very first dinner event, and it was amazing. We were greeted by the owner, Amy and chose our table. It was BYOB, so they chilled our beers and brought water to the table. A waiter came along and explained the menu to us, and then we got started on the best dinner ever.Appetizers: we got chorizo egg rolls served with jalapeno Aioli and vegetarian egg rolls served with mojo. They were cooked perfectly- crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Delicious! The sauces were an added bonus. Main course: tabletop hot pots (1 per couple) that were divided down the middle with two different broths- miso and spicy thai, both of which are amazing. Then we had a plate of things to cook, including beef carpaccio (thinly sliced beef that cooks very quickly), soy ginger pork meatballs (the best meatballs I have ever had), tofu, fish balls, calamari (already fully cooked), chinese spinach, bean sprouts, water cress, and chumichurri sauce. The sauce was so good I could help but to just eat some of it on its own! Everything was fresh, and they were very generous with portions. By the time we were done, we were stuffed!!Dessert- the best beignets! We had azuki red bean and banana nutella, both of which were so good. The mexican hot chocolate was so delicious, and I couldn't stop drinking it even though I was already stuffed!The head chef, Rafael, is an amazing cook with such great ideas. He is also super friendly. He came out to chat, and it was so nice to have a conversation with him.If Saucy Porka has more dinner events, you should definitely go- it's worth it!"
"I don't understand the hype.It's a small place so if you want to eat there, you have to fight for a table.  Here's what I had: Saucy Porka - think pulled pork but with kimchi on top on a mildly crunchy baguette - okay.Shrimp tacos - coleslaw, shrimp, on an Asian flat folded bun (bao) - kind of blandMiso short rib tacos - I think it's mango on top of cubed short ribs - best of the three.There's also noodle soups that I'll have to try next time.In all, a solid lunch place, but not worthy of the 5 start treatments."
"I found myself at Union Station hungry and needing to find some lunch. Fortunately, Yelp suggested Saucy Porka, and I'm always down for buying tacos individually, so I went down to give it a try.Saucy Porka is where I worked downtown for a few years, so it was a little bit like a homecoming. Their big twist on tacos (bacos?) is to fuse Latin and Asian flavors, and spread them onto a warm, spongy bao tortilla. The ""tortilla"" takes a little getting used to, but that means you can get away with strong flavors. Speaking of which...Pork Carnitas. These were topped with marinated pineapples. The pork was shredded and tender, although I don't remember much about the sauce. Still worth getting.Thai Chicken Curry - This, and the shrimp taco, were topped with crunchy cole slaw. Not too hot, ample amounts of curry sauce. I'm not sure if there was coconut in it. I guess I'll have to try it again to see!Sofrito Shrimp - Saved the best for last. I love well-cooked shrimp, and the baby shrimp served here tasted good and relatively tender. The sauce wasn't totally assertive, and went really well with the shrimp.I didn't get anything to drink, but they do sell Foco drinks, which is a nod to my favorite childhood floating-coconut-bit drink.I'm not sure how often I'll be drifting around the South Loop, but if I find myself there over the lunch hour, Saucy Porka's where I'll be."
"Went here for a quick lunch today and was very pleased with the meal. My only regret is that I didn't get the chorizo egg rolls.  I got the domo origato and it was very good. The short rib had excellent flavor and was cooked well. It could have maybe used just a touch more sauce on it but overall was very good. I guess the one complaint is that it could have also been a little bigger for $11, but short rib aint cheap.  My friend orderd two steamed bun tacos (short rib and I think carnitas) and liked both of those. Definitely a solid place and glad I stopped!"
"Thanks to my coworkers Ron and Erik, I found this awesome place.  Had the short rib bowl and tried chorizo egg rolls.  The short ribs are flavorful and tender.  One of the top two short rib preparations I have ever had.The chorizo egg rolls were well fried and a novel twist on the chinese classic.  The owner stopped by our table.  Seemed like a very nice guy.  Saucy Porka is my new favorite loop lunch spot!"
I LOVE this place! It's like a sexy Asian dude made love to a beautiful Latina woman and produced this delicious baby called Saucy Porka.
"Definitely worth trying out. This is a great lunch spot with very flavorful options. It's nice that they don't overwhelm you with the menu options. Try a couple tacos, bowl, or sandwich plus the sweet potato fries! The staff is great, the stomach was happy, and I'll definitely swing back around to this place in the future. The noon time is quite busy, but the line moved rather fast. We took our food to go, but there is a fair amount of room to dine inside. Enjoy!"
"I was Craving Kimchi and my coworker was craving sweet potato fries, So We found this place.We shared  pork Nacho Kim & Curry Sweet potato fries. It was super delicious.The place is really small, so get it to go. The service is quick and they are super friendly"
"I've had bacos here and they are tasty. Some of the varieties, however, are a little too salty.  The staff are friendly and fast.  They have an efficient system of handing out the completed orders and the guys putting the orders together are super high energy and very nice - It's fun to see them work.  I do think the prices are a bit high, and I wish they had some combo deals, such as any four bacos for $10, instead of all the items being a la carte."
"Everybody at my office has been raving about this place, so I decided to give it a try. Stopped by during lunch (especially since there doesn't seem to be that many decent lunch options in the Loop). I was looking at the menu on the wall and the guy at the register was really sweet and said, ""First time here?"" and when I answered yes, he asked me how hungry I was, and then came to recommend the ramen or Asian paella. I'm extremely picky about my ramen since I spent 4 months in Japan, so I opted for the Asian paella. Definitely not a bad choice! Oh and it took them less than 5 minutes to get it boxed up in a to go box for me so that my coworker and I could sit outside across the street and enjoy the sunshine! Service was great, from the guy running the iPad register to the guy who boxed up my food with a smile and an attempt at saying my name-- plus he was cute!!! I'm half tempted to give them 5 stars. I think I'll have to try more menu items to see if I want to up the rating though. Oh, the Asian paella is very flavorful, has Chinese sausage and very delicious pork carnitas (reminded me of the way my mom would prepare beef for us when I was younger--- it basically flakes apart because it's so tender) and edamame. The total was $10 and was enough to last me for lunch the next day too-- not a bad deal!I like this so much, I'll definitely be catering from here next week."
"Awesome breakfast ""Bacos""made on request. Super friendly staff and perfectly flavorful food. I highly recommend!"
"One of the best food places in Chicago!  Great emergence of culture, taste, and ambiance.   I would definitely get everything and avoid nothing."
"The food here is off the hook, hands down the best Mexican-Asian fusion lunch spot in the southern financial district. The miso short rib bao tacos (""bacos"") will leave you slumped over, drooling and mumbling incoherently. THEY'RE THAT GOOD. I also recommend the pozole, but then again, I'm simply a pozole addict. It's thick and saucy with satisfying pork chunks and just enough grease to really bring out the pork flavor, all while bombing your taste buds with chile pepper spice. YES."
"I've made it my personal mission to introduce friends to Saucy Porka for lunch.  The food is outstanding, and the owners/staff are as pleasant as could be.  I've been here at least 5 times and everything has been consistently great.The chorizo egg rolls are delicious (so are the veg egg rolls, but if you're a meat eater don't miss out!).  It's such a nice combination of flavor and the egg rolls always come out piping hot and just the right texture.  I've also had curry chicken, steak, and pork carnita bacos.  The chicken is the best, though the others are very good as well.At some point, I will try other things but I'm still stuck on the egg rolls and bacos. ;)"
"Went with the signature plate, a banh mi called the Saucy Porka, which was basically a pork carnitas sammie with some tasty sauce and toppings.  The egg rolls that my friend got looked like the winner here, but the food was good even if it was a little small.  Service was fast and friendly; this is a tough place to eat when it's cold outside, since the Saucy Porka space is small and I think it's a single-door operation, so sitting in the middle of the restaurant on a day like today is a no-fly zone!  Otherwise, tasty food."
"I first heard of this place at a Chicago Food Truck Festival... and had Saucy Porka's amazing nachos.  It was a chilly night for an outdoor food truck event, all I remember is that my mouth was on fire because the Umami Nachos ($7) had this spicy, garlicky jalapeno aioli sauce(?).  I don't know if that's how they make it usually (at the restaurant) but the nachos were great, and I managed to snag the last helping of it before the food truck staff had to cross off that option on their little chalkboard menu.I went here for lunch at the actual establishment.  The lowdown: this place embodies Asian-Latin fusion.  It's different than other fusion places because Saucy Porka is not strictly say, Korean-Mexican or Vietnamese-Cuban.  They have a mix of all flavors which gives their menu more diversity.  Like their menu includes chorizo tacos, banh mi's, Asian style Paella, Pork Ramen soup and Banana Nutella Beignets...  my coworker and I stood googley-eyed for a while, staring at the menu because there were too many things we wanted to try.I ordered their Curry Sweet Potato Fries (Large $5) and a Thai Curry Chicken Bao Taco ""Baco"" ($2.75) to-go.  The crinkle fries were just okay.  I guess keep in mind if you order to-go, things might be soggier at their destination than before... of course at no fault of the restaurant.  I just walked a LONG way to get here and thought it was worth it, hah.I haven't come enough to really pick out a favorite thing yet, but I would do one thing differently.  Order more than ONE Baco.  One doesn't do your appetite justice and since I got my lunch to-go, I was left with a cliffhanger.  Bacos are dangerously delicious.  Just saying: order bacos like you would order sushi... or tamales... or tapas.... ie NOT just one at a time.  The owner was there at lunchtime and he was very nice.  It was after the lunch rush so the place wasn't too crowded, but he told me and my coworker that although they've only been only open for a few months, they've been doing well.  They're being featured on the Hungry Hound, and it was sweet that he was proud of his restau's progress.  I think they'll become a go-to lunch place to people in the Loop.  They offer a kaleidoscope of flavors, their menu is fun and I will be back!"
This place is an awesome spot to grab a quick bite in the loop. Chorizo egg rolls are a must.
"Very very good and interesting concept, blending Wow Bao and tacos! Really great taste in an off the beaten path spot in the South Loop. Check it out. Pork carnitas are fabulous and the Miso Short Rib tacos are unreal good."
"This food is amazing. The first time a co-worker asked me if we could go to lunch here I thought Asian Fusion no thanks, went and was pleasantly surprised on how good it was. So delicious and every I bring here loves it. My only complaint it it's not open for dinner, doesn't have any other locations and not open on weekends. Hopefully this place will expand and will open more locations. This is a must try!"
"Really, really disappointed.1. Miso Braised Beef Short Rib - Didn't taste much of the rib. Pineapple wasn't strong and flavors combined were weak. Beef was honestly not very good.2. Pork carnitas - Pineapple salsa didn't add much to the pork. Could really be a lot better.3. Ramen - Yes--it's really pho. Not ramen. And the pork is decent but not great. Could be gotten in Chinatown for 5-6$ not the $8.75 here.I'd come again to try bahn mi like the Saucy Porka (namesake). First time: really disappointed."
"Minus one star for service, outstanding on taste.I had a Giftie for this place (awesome app, btw) and the man ringing up my order insisted I had already used it because he couldn't redeem it (this was my first time at the restaurant). No comps no discounts just attitude. The saucy porka is indeed yummy but my favorites are the bacos: shrimp is fantastic, Thai chicken and miso braised short rib ones are great as well.You get a free bag of cassava chips with the saucy porka or a fountain drink, but the cashier didn't offer the chips, just gave me the drink cup (I double checked and he said I can get the chips) - intentional or accidental, I don't know, but not a fan of the attitude."
"I have frequented this restaurants a few times before deciding to write my review.  Honestly the first time I tried it I would have given it 3 stars because the tofu on my Soy Ginger Tofu Baco was tasty but a bit too tough to bite through.  However, I gave them another chance and am so glad that I did!As a vegetarian I didn't think I could eat at a place named and decorated with pigs.  However, I have had their Soy Ginger Tofu Bacos and Chipolte Fries on several occasions now and have really grown to love this little place.  The menu is small but has something for everybody.  I enjoy the bacos and notice a lot of people getting 2-3 different kinds of bacos on their visit.  It's nice that they are ala carte so you can do that easily.  They also have several tasty sauces that come with various dishes or can be added for $0.50 to any dish.  (I love the Mojo sauce!)I will say that it would be great if they could find an easier way to have people wait for to-go orders.  It's a small space so it gets cramped during the lunch rush.  However, they are really quick (usually about 5 minutes from order to bag in hand even during the rush!) and friendly!  I would love some bar seating along the window or more seating in general.  I definitely recommend checking this place out, delicious!"
"What a cute little spot!  LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the short rib rice bowl.  The folks behind the counter were so sweet and patient with me as I studied the menu board.  You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table when it's ready.  I asked a few questions and they went into detail describing how things were made.  They really care about food!Will be back 'pho sho' for the pho that I spied on another customer's table as we left. :-)"
"Very good.  Had the thai curry bacos and they were delicious.  quick, casual.  There are places to sit, however, very busy during lunch.  I will be back!"
Ok i work right next to this place and walked past it a hundred times but never went inside until recently. I have been missing out on some amazing food.  This is a Latin and Asian fusion restaurant and they got me hook line and sinker now.  I will have to make this a regular stop and I'm excited to try everything on the menu.  The first thing I ordered was a Pork Carnitas Baco.  What is a Baco you say???? Well its a Taco on a Bao bun.  See what they did there?  They fused latin and asian food together and invented something very special.  The Baco was amazing.I then ordered some vegetarian egg rolls and some sweet potato fries.  Sweet potato fries are difficult to get crispy and they accomplished this feat.  The sauce that comes with the fries and egg rolls are very tasty.I will definitely go back very soon.  Keep up the good work.
"Saucy Porka is a hidden gem in the south corner of the loop. I feel like food in the loop can be pretty one dimensional and not terribly creative, so it was a breath of fresh air to step into Saucy Porka. Their menu is filled with dishes that combine elements of Mexican and South American cuisine with Eastern Asian dishes. The Bacos were delicious, particularly the Miso Short Rib Baco. Our group also tried the tostones (which  were perfectly crisp and paired well with the spiced mayo sauce) and the sweet potato fries (also served with a sauce that did the fries justice). In addition to the creative and unique dishes, the service here was unexpectedly great. The staff who brought the food out were informative and engaging, which was a surprise for a place where you wouldn't necessarily be going to for the service.Prices were also on par with a Roti or a Chipotle. Definitely recommended for those looking for something more exciting to eat in the loop than the typical mediterranean and sandwich shops."
I love this place! It's busy during lunch but so worth it! I have dreams about the short rib baco. Today I tried the pork ramen and loved it too. The curry sauce that comes with their sweet potato fries is awesome. The service is pretty fast for lunch hour rush. The employees are so nice. I highly recommend Saucy Porka!
"Unique place! I got a sandwich while my friend got the tacos. Both of ours were incredible! We both got chicken curry but I lived the bread they served my sandwich on and the tacos used a unique tortilla that I have never seen before. They are small so I would recommend 3. The workers were nice and after realizing they forgot my friends order for a few minutes they provided us free beignets! We never complained as we were in no rush, and they too were incredible!"
"Believe the hype!Made my first visit at noon during a work hour rush with 4 other colleagues. Could have been a recipe for a cramped and inconvenient lunch, but that certainly wasn't the case. The restaurant was busy, but we were able find seats. The staff went well beyond the norm for a counter service restaurant. They eased us into our seats and brought over our food with great enthusiasm. Extremely friendly and helpful. Plus, the food was amazing. Will definitely go back."
"Amazing service, amazing food, you can't go wrong trying to eat a meal here for a decent price in the loop.  Miso short rib bowl is money.  Fries are a must add on."
"The complete embodiment of joyful eating. Inventive. Bold. Delicious. Sensuous. Simple, elegant, masterful creation of flavor. The owner proudly engaged each and every customer, taking delight in their enjoyment of his food and creating an inviting atmosphere where all that mattered was good quality food. Pork RamenChorizo Egg RollsCarnitas BacoThai Chicken Curry BacoSoy Ginger Tofu BacoMiso Braised Short Rib Baco"
"Best fusion place I've had in Chicago. The pork ramen is my favorite. The bacos are also a must-get. End the meal with the nutella, banana beignets, and you can't go wrong. It gets pretty packed during lunch time. Come a little before or after lunch time. The staff is very friendly!"
"It honestly doesn't get better than this!Great restaurant tucked away in the Loop.  The decor is clean and inviting, with lots of rich dark woods.  But let's get to the food.  This place is an Asian/Latin fusion with fantastic Bao Tacos.  We tried the Thai chicken curry, miso braised beef short rib, and sofrito marinated shrimp.  All are delicious.  We also got the Pork Ramen Soup... so good.  Lots of meat and a great pho soup base.The service is very good here as well.  The owner comes around and asks you himself how the meal is going.  For example, I wanted a little more kick and asked for more chopped jalapenos and cilantro for the soup and the owner himself got them for me.  Also the food comes out relatively quickly.  Prices are a little higher for the food, but I still kept the review at 5 stars for all the other excellent qualities.Give it a try!"
"The soy ginger ""bacos"" are so tasty!! I also recommend the beet salad. All of the sauces and dressings are clearly homemade, and the flavors are wonderful. Come for a delicious meal with cheery owners."
Tried this place out while looking for places to eat on Yelp. Fast service. The people were really nice and food was delicious. Definitely a great find.
"This place is delicious! The food is one-of-a-kind, and the staff was super friendly and willing to explain the menu to us first-timers. I had the Miso Short Rib Bacos and the sweet potato fries, both of which were great. It's a small place and it was pretty busy when we were there, but it's worth the short wait!"
"I popped in around 9am, so the lunch meats weren't quire ready yet. The manager(?) was very friendly though and accommodated as much as he could. Because I was the only one in at the time, we got to talking about how the business started and he let me try the na-cho kim. It was delish, the flavors mixed really well between the jalapeno aioli, pork, and kimchi, without one overpowering the other. Had the queso fresco & egg and chorizo & egg banh mi off the breakfast menu. Both had good flavor for seemingly simple items. The only lunch item available was the paella with Chinese sausage and pork(?). The rice was well-seasoned and I've never had traditional paella so I can't compare it to anything. Vietnamese coffee was much bigger than expected but the flavor was just as expected, a deep espresso flavor with sweetened condensed milk. Yumm.Although I didn't try the bacos which I was hoping to, the menu was creative and fresh. Overall it's a trendy casual place for lunch with some unique flavors. Will go back again!"
"The sweet potato fries and (light and fluffy) Bacos were very tasty. Go early to avoid a line! I went at 11:30 and had no problem getting a table. But there aren't many so once they fill up, you probably have to wait or take it to go."
"The pork ramen is the best ramen I've ever had. The combination of flavors is so intriguing on your tongue! Tender, rich, braised pork with fresh, crisp cilantro - just enough heat from the fresh jalapeños and the broth...wow... You've got to get there and try it! I've also tried several bacos. You can't go wrong here!"
"Every time I go to Saucy Porka, I order the Saucy Porka.  Say what?  It seems to make sense to order the food item that is featured in the name of a restaurant just to see how good it is.  The Saucy Porka served at Saucy Porka is a sandwich of pork carnitas and tangy (and not too spicy) kimchi stuffed in a long crusty French baguette.  It's a fusion-style banh mi sandwich that delivers the goods, full of tender and flavorful meat.  The sandwiches come with either a fountain pop or a bag of cassava chips (did ya think you would get a generic bag of chips here?).   Indeed it seems like the whole menu is a list of delicious sounding items that may seem quite exotic if you eat only at generic chain restaurants.  Some items lean on the Asian side, some feature Latin ingredients, and some feature both.  You can get sides like curry sweet potato fries or chorizo egg rolls, both good and each served with a mild aioli dip (curry aioli for the fries and avocado aioli for the chorizo egg rolls).  My friend had the Yammy Yammy, and I know he's not a vegetarian but a baguette with sweet potatoes and grilled green peppers and onions sounds pretty good.  The pozole is a spicy hit with my boss, and he is neither Asian nor Latin (though the pozole is both).  I need to keep coming back to try other items on their menu, but I will probably always order the self-titled Saucy Porka.  The sitting area fills up during lunchtime, but I am fortunate that this place is only a few blocks from my office."
"Insert sad Saucy face here. How in the world this place gets a 4.5 star rating is beyond me. It's not terrible, but nothing is mind blowing or even done all that well. Perhaps their  ""fusion"" of Vietnamese, Mexican, Chinese, and French has them stretched too thin. Everything I have tried has lacked full flavor. For instance, the tostones were flavorless and mealy and came with a curry sauce? Say what Porky? Curry on tostones? I don't know, it was off to me. The flavor combo was not ideal. And I love bao buns, but again they tasted like flavorless cotton balls. The contents inside were ok and I ended up just eating that. I threw everything else away. No joke. The place gets packed at a weekday lunch in a neighborhood with few good foodie options. You can do the math. But hey, to each their own. Give it your own test run; we all have different taste preferences. This is just my humble yelp. The staff was super friendly, the place is cute, it's convenient to the L. Maybe if I worked in the neighborhood I would give it another shot, but as it stands, I won't be going back."
"My experience at Saucy Porka was overwhelmingly mediocre. Everything on the menu sounds delicious, but leaves something to be desired. Also, this is not the place to go if you hate nice people. The staff was constantly asking if they could help and offering suggestions on what on the menu is best suited for my tastes."
"With such incredible reviews I had incredibly high expectations of this place! It is a little hole in the wall, good for picking up lunch (not too much seating though). I ordered the carnitas baco and short rib baco. Both were quite tasty, although the short rib was better! I easily could have had a third one. Yummy quick lunch and incredibly nice staff! I'd love to come back and explore the menu more!"
"I absolutely adore this restaurant. I work near--just down the street--and was originally referred to this place as an ""Excellent alternative to sandwiches and chicken joints."" Without a doubt, my coworker was 100% correct. A fusion of Asian and Latin influences, these folks know how to sling good dish. My personal favorite is the Arroz con Edamame: saffron rice with chives, carrots, steamed edamame, and your choice of meat or tofu--personally, I always go with the curried chicken and I am never, ever disappointed. The rice is fluffy and soft, the meat tender and perfectly seasoned. All served in a welcoming, charmingly small downtown location. What is worth noting, however--above the incredibly flavorful and inventive menu--is the exceptional customer service. Not only does this small crew of cooks, cashiers, and servers know how to keep an intense around-the-corner line moving mid day in the financial district, but they do with with unwavering smiles. Every. Single. Time I go into this business, the staff welcomes me with a smile that feels neither overwhelming or false. These folks seem to really enjoy working for this unique, wonderful joint. 10/10 recommended."
"This place is a great addition to the Loop ie Boringsandwichland.For our appetizers we tried the nachos, sweet potato fries, and veggie eggrolls. I have to say the appetizers were kind of a miss because they lacked wow-flavor and sounded much better than they tasted. The sweet potato fries did not have any curry in it and the sauces were kinda bland. Please amp up your appetizers Saucy Porka!For the entrees, I had the Asian Paella which was loaded with flavorful pork and it tasted pretty home-y, which is a great thing. I sampled the shrimp and chicken baos and those were tasty as well. They were handing out free beignets when we arrived and that was a nice touch in addition to the friendly owners. Great menu for lunch, this place has potential! I would come back to try other items!"
"I had high expectations of this place.  There was some winners, some ties, and some losers.WIN-Pork Banh Mi was delicious.  $8.75 for a sandwich and chips.  Kimchi was crispy and slighty acidic with a tang of spice.  Pork was moist and flavorful.WIN-Shrimp Baco.  Delicious flavor of spicy shrimp balanced by the sweetness of pineapple and I just love bao buns so that was decent as well.TIE-Curry Sweet Potato Fries.  Honestly, they were OK.  I thought they just tasted like sweet potato fries.  I couldnt taste any curry on them.  There was only a small amount of cheese sprinkled on a few of the fries and a small container of a cheesy sauce for the large order.  I thought they kind of lacked flavor.  I did like that they were crinkle cut...TIE-Chicken Curry Baco.  Decent.  I think it could have used slightly more flavor??  The bao bun is bland so to make it go really well, I think there has to be a decent amount of flavor on whatever is on the bun.  It just wasnt there.  The chicken was cooked perfectly though and very moist.Loser-Ginger Tofu Baco.  Bland, boring, bao bun taco was breaking (see pic).  Bummer. Loser-Price.  It was a little expensive for what you get.  $26 for a lunch for two that left me barely full.Loser-No public bathroom.  Dont sit down restaurants have to have a bathroom for patrons???Loser-Condiments.  There was a sole bottle of sriacha sauce that was empty by the napkins during the start of lunch...Loser-no silverware available that I could tell.  We wanted to split our sandwich and bacos and ended up doing it with our teeth.  They should have an area with lots of condiments and silverware so you dont have to get back in line to get them.Overall, I was really expecting much better flavor of almost everything.  Maybe I ordered wrong...I dont know.  I wasnt impressed.They are just starting up so I would really give them a 3.5 but no halves on Yelp."
"This was a my first stop for food while vacationing in Chi-town this summer. All I have to say is ""meh"". The place is small, which gives it a nice hole-in-the-wall feel. But it was rather dirty and super cramped. The food was greasy and didn't leave much of an impression... aside from ""ah! grease!!!"". My friend and I ordered the Ho Chi Minh Banh Mi (curry chicken), pork ramen soup, and pork carnitas and miso braised beef short ribs bacos. The sandwich was definitely the most flavorful and it was a good twist to have curry chicken in banh mi form. But it was drippy and kind of soggy. The ramen was below mediocre: noddle was decent (probably from a pack readily available at japanese market), the meat was super dry and tough, and the broth was heavier than normal jpn or chinese noodle soups... not necessarily more flavorful, but saltier. The two bacos were interesting. I just thought the quality of the meats were mediocre and they relied too much on the sauces to make the dish. If I visit Chicago again, I probably wouldn't be too hurt about not coming back here."
"I'm quite happy about this new addition to the neighborhood. Off Financial Street, it's not on a main thoroughfare so keep a close eye when you're looking for it. When you walk in, you're immediately drawn to a blackboard menu of items. We were greeted with a friendly staff who also directed us to a paper menu with more items available. It is ""fusion"" mixing mostly Vietnamese-inspired food with traditional Latin flavors. We ordered the pork banh mi ($8.50), chorizo eggrolls ($2.75), and shrimp and short rib bao tacos ($3.50 each). The banh mi was wonderful. The pork was very tender and seemed slow-cooked. The roll was actually wonderful because compared to other banh mi, the sandwich bread is thinner with a firmer crust similar to flatbread. The kim chi on it was also tasty. The chorizo eggrolls were fantastic -- the eggroll wrapping was perfectly fried and just thick enough. It was a little on the heavy side and densely-packed with meat (!!) so therefore it's actually worth the $2.75! The bao tacos were both delicious and their respective fruit salsas upped the ante in flavor! We thought, however, that it should be reduced in price a bit -- perhaps $3.00 instead of $3.50. We met the owner who was very attentive to the customers' needs. Though it's not a sit-down restaurant, she came around making sure everyone was happy and the food was tasting good. I asked what the restaurant icon is and as suspected, it's actually a pig nostril and a spoon. Cute design! Overall, I'm a fan!"
"MMMMM... I don't know that I would eat here daily, but it is an awesome monthly stop.  Very unique offering, absolutely delicious!"
"Interesting Asian-Latin fusion dishes here.  Quaint little place, but people were hustling and bustling through.  Staff was really friendly and welcoming.  Service was fast.  We tried the ""bacos"" (bao tacos)...one pulled pork and two miso braised short ribs.  They were yummy.  My favorite was the Asian style paella though.  It was fancy fried rice with a flair.  :)"
"If I started this out saying, ""you haven't lived until you've eaten at Saucy Porka."" You wouldn't believe me. Believe me.So many restaurants make attempts at fusing multiple cultures into one meal, yet so few have succeeded. When I thought Del Seoul had their Latin Asian fusion on lock down, I was clearly not thinking right.Thank the universe for bestowing the loop with Saucy Porka. Everything is an actual, and equal blend of Asian flavors mixed with those south of the border.I ate a few bacos, along with the egg roll and...OH MY GOD. As long as people don't go during my lunch hour, I highly recommend this as a Friday lunch out with the coworkers. But grab it to go and eat at the park next store. It's cramped in there."
"This place has an interesting concept. Usually when it comes to fusion food, I am hesitant because I am a huge junkie for authenticity. However, this place does quite a good job in making sure that the flavors do not get lost when immersing dishes from two cultures together.Tostones, plantines with some shrimp and sauces and such on top, not very good. Don't like the taste and texture of the whole concept. The vegetarian eggrolls are pretty good, kind of reminds me of the avocado eggrolls at cheesecake factory, except these don't have avocado in it. It has vermicelli, mushroom and some cabbage. It does come with a creamy avocado sauce.The  ginger tofu bacos, good concept, love that it is tofu on the inside, different than the usual pulled pork, however, the tofu is way to salty. Also need to figure out a good way to keep the slaw on top so that the bite is crunchy. Fried rice with pull pork(rice bowl), also comes with a vegetarian option, kind of bland. A lot of rice not much flavor. I'd say the pork one has more flavor, because it is obviously cooked with meat.They have these fried dough dessert(they call it beignet, however does not taste like beignet) with either nutella or red bean inside. It's ok, not that different than a donut, I think I liked the dessert the least. Overall, this place is not cheap, especially for a lunch joint. They close by 4pm. No public bathroom, limited tables for seating. The plus, good customer service."
"Love this food. Don't miss: chorizo egg rolls (something crack-like about that aioli sauce), nutella beignets and fresh squeezed lemonade infusions. So happy SP offers office catering, it spices up the corporate lunch rotation - and now it's a staple. Our Porkas love the variety (meat and veggie friendly) and boxed portions - so they can quickly sneak off with their packed lunch. I make them come back and socialize for the beignets. A happy team, is a productive team. Call Amy to order ahead - she'll hook it up."
"I think this place has so much potential! However, after my first experience here, it is tough to convince myself to go back.It's difficult to rate this place. If it were a restaurant by where I live, in Lakeview, I would probably be rating it 4 stars, but for a Loop lunch, it fits in better at 3 for me. Unfortunately, what makes this a somewhat un-ideal lunch spot during the work week is that a) the prices are pretty high b) the portions are comparatively low for the prices c) it takes a little while to get my food after I've ordered for takeout.The one time I visited, my coworker got the three bacos and I got the Saucy Porka. We had to wait a little while to get our food, and the place was packed, so it was an awkward queuing situation. When we did get our food, I thought the flavors were a slam dunk. Come to think of it, I would come back here solely for the sweet potato fries. I've tried sweet potato fires with a spicy aioli, I've tried sweet potato fries with a marshmallow dip, but for whatever reason I wouldn't think sweet potato fries, especially ones that aren't as crispy, would work with cheese. These totally do and I loves them.I also loved the flavors in the Saucy Porka sandwich, but I wouldn't get it again. It was made on crusty bread and the pork in the sandwich is topped with kimchi. I love both pork and kimchi, but was sandwich was half tough, crusty bread, and the other half was really soggy from the kimchi. It made it a rather unenjoyable experience. My coworker really liked her bacos, but they were tiny and three of them cost more than 10 dollars.While we liked the idea and thought the flavors were great. For the price, it's just not enough food or mind blowing to put into the regular lunch circulation at all. I think in a different place, this would be awesome. I hope to have a splurge day and visit again, however, and try something a little different next time."
"I like the concept - Asian + Latin makes food interesting. However, I left feeling uninterested.The curry sweet potato fries was served with queso fresco cheese. I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but the dish felt dull.The pork canitas and Thai chicken curry Baco was tasty, but again, nothing stood out from it.Domo Arigato banh mi would've been good but I kept getting pieces of bone, which made my sandwich hard to eat. I'm not sure if it's because banh mi is so popular here in Houston, but the bread that Saucy Porka had did not stand up to Houston's banh mi bread. It was flimsy and fell apart rather easily. You had a choice of cassava chips or a foundation drink to go along with its meal. I thought cassava chips would be a nice touch since I had yucca fries at Baohaus in New York. However, these cassava chips were processed, not homemade. Had they made their own cassava chips, I might've appreciated my sandwich more... maybe.Saucy Porka's saving grace is surprisingly the ramen. My hubby made a face when he saw that it was served in a pho broth. However, their pho broth was quite flavorful. Even though it's not like Japanese ramen, it was still tasty and quite refreshing with the cool weather. The ramen would probably be the only reason we would come back. However, I am curious to try their specials such as the red bean beignets."
"I got to try Saucy Porka on my last trip to Chicago to see a friend and I must say, I am glad I did.! I love the concept of fusing Asian and Latin flavors. Located in The Loop, it appears to be fan of many local workers. I saw a handful of people stop in during their lunch breaks. My friend and I ordered the Vietnamese iced coffee, chorizo egg roll, miso braised beef short rib baco, pork carnitas baco and the sofrito marinated shrimp baco. The Vietnamese iced coffee didn't quite taste as strong as the ones that I'm used to-- it tasted like regular coffee. The chorizo egg roll was nicely fried and had a good amount of seasoning. All the bacos looked deliciousssss! My favorite has to be the short rib baco- however both the beef and the shrimp was tender and I enjoyed every minute of devouring them :) My only regret was that I could not try more of their menu. The staff is extremely friendly as well! I want to say it was the owner who came by each table to make sure that everything was to everyone's satisfaction, so extra props to Saucy Porka for taking their customer service up a notch!"
"Asian latin fusion? YES PLEASE! The concept plus the great variety in the menu already caught my attention! We went in with only 30 minutes until closing but they were more than happy to serve the  three of us. Since it was our first time there and only had a slight idea of what to get from a few yelp reviews, I asked for some recommendations. The girl at the counter was more than happy to tell us all her favorites. We had the pork ramen soup, miso braised short rib rice bowl, and curry sweet potato fries. Later on, I was intrigued to try the fresh mojito flavored lemonade. Everything was delicious! However, the pork ramen soup was more like pho  with ramen noodles but the broth was rich and very tasty!One thing that completed my overall experience was how nice the staff was! Since there were three of us, they split the ramen into three small bowls. It might be because it was almost closing time but the portions were pretty big and we were super full. I'm glad to have given this place a try and hope to return soon for some bacos and more!"
"Coming into Chicago on a rainy afternoon and having to wait several hours to meet up with a friend in The Loop, I was really looking forward to a good meal to fill me up and keep me in good spirits.  After narrowing down my options to locations close to the Blue line as I rode in from O'Hare, Saucy Porka appealed to me, both in terms of its menu and its Yelp praise.  Perhaps I let the expectations get the best of me...I'll start with the good - the service is wonderful!  All three of the front-facing employees were helpful with the menu, very friendly, and courteous.  Over the course of maybe 30 minutes, if that, they came around checking to see how the food was and removing finished trays no fewer than four times, even though it is not a sit-down service restaurant.Unfortunately, the food, in my opinion, was not on par with the service.  Because the prices are so reasonable, I was able to sample a few dishes: the curry sweet potato fries, the chorizo egg rolls, and two tacos (Carnitas and Thai Chicken Curry).  The flavor of both appetizers was overwhelmed by the ""fried"" taste and heavily dependent on the accompanying sauces.  The fries lacked the creamy, flavorful middle of a good sweet potato fry, which really would have went well with the curry seasoning.  The egg rolls were good every three or four bites when I was able to experience the inside components without too much of the fried outer wall.  As for the tacos, I'll start with the buns, which are used as substitutes for the standard tortilla.  Perhaps my expectations for the buns were too high after having some truly delicious experiences (i.e.; magical, delicious, cloud-like buns) at several Japanese restaurants in NYC over the years; these were certainly not that, but rather, a bit too dough-y.  The Thai Chicken Curry taco didn't leave much to write about - the chicken was a bit dry, with bland seasoning and an uninspired slaw.  The pork taco was probably my favorite of the four dishes.  Although the pineapple wasn't as flavorful or key to this dish as it is in many other variations, the pork itself was plentiful and flavorful; definitely my recommendation of the four.I'm clearly in the minority with my review, and perhaps it's due to the circumstances under which I visited.  For people looking for a quick lunch in the area, its location next to Subway and nearby to at least two Potbelly's I noticed, it's certainly a breath of fresh air.  For someone like myself, looking for a well-above-average lunch, it unfortunately did not click."
YESYESYES. This place is awesome. Love their food! Such creative dishes and everything has such great flavor! Who would've thought to mix latin and asian cuisines to make new creations?! Pure genius. Delicious food and great prices. Only downside is that there's nowhere to park. Make sure you're walking when you go! But the food is great. Definitely worth a bit of a walk :)
"I paid a visit here on my lunch break because A) I love supporting local restaurants, and B) Umm...with rave reviews like these, I knew I had to try it! And boy, was I impressed.I got here at about 1:15 or so on a Tuesday afternoon. There was only one person ahead of me in line, and a few tables were seated with customers. I had read on Yelp prior to coming in to try the Bacos, the Chorizo Egg Rolls, and the Sweet Potato Fries. I was ready to do just that when my eyes fell upon a board on the counter which featured their Cubana Sandwich (which wasn't on the main menu). Roasted pork, japapeno aioli, ham, and pickled onion on crusty bread. You had me at hello! So I opted for this sandwich and got one Miso Braised Short Rib Baco. The man working at the register (probably the owner) was very very friendly and was happy to hear I found out about them on Yelp. After ordering, I took a seat and waited maybe 5 or 6 minutes. Not bad.Once the food got to the table. I was all....""Ohhhh man...."" It looked BOMB. It smelled even better. But then when I took a bite (after snapping a picture, because Instagram), I was taken to food nirvana! The baco was awesome. Bits of pineapple  were the perfect complementary taste to the braised pork. I loooved the consistency of the bun.But the Cubana Sandwich? Oh. My. God. The flavors, the juiciness, the texture, just...EVERYTHING. I don't have to say anything else. Just get it if you can. It's literally heaven all wrapped up in crusty, warm, awesome bread.I can't wait to visit again and try other things, but please support this local business! They are worth every penny you spend. And for only around $8 or $9, a great place to eat if you're near the CBOT/the Loop."
"All around great experience for my first time here. I got the pork baco, shrimp baco, and sweet potato fries. It was a good size meal and a good price for the quality. The fries were excellent and the bacos were fresh, hot, and full of flavor. Their employees were also extremely friendly and helpful."
"Saucy Porka consistently hits it out of the park when it comes to their menu.  I have yet to meet a baco here I wasn't crazy about.  The sweet potato fries are perfectly crispy and as great as the cheese sauce used to be, the new curry aioli is a million times better.  The real charm of this place goes above and beyond the food.  Every single employee I've crossed paths with here is amazing.  They are all so kind and attentive.  Genuinely apologetic when the wait times get a little long but, in all seriousness, this food is worth the wait!  Is a warm, welcoming lunch spot.  Fantastic flavors and well prepared, beautifully presented dishes that will make you want to try the entire menu."
"It's too bad that they aren't open later as I would have stopped by there more often. Got the miso braised short rib bowl and it was quite good. Luckily, even though this place is quite busy the food came out pretty fast and there are places to sit right outside Lasalle street station right there.Sadly, this is one of the places I probably will never go to again as I don't work around the area or take that train home anymore. Quite delicious though."
"Service here is incredible. The owner came over and also gave me a complimentary mojito lemonade. The carnitas and miso short rib bacos were slightly too salty for my taste. The meat could be more tender and bao less soggy on one of them but they were still tasty. The sweet potato fries though, were perfection, perfectly crispy and salty with a delicious sweet curry aioli. I thought the cheese on top was unnecessary at first but they actually add good salt flavor. The green onions on top were fresh. Wish they added that in my bacos"
I'd eat here every day if I could get in!
This place is amazing! Asian and latin fusion is a wonderful thing! Their tostones with curry sauce are out of this world! Definitely a go to of mine when I'm in the neighborhood.
"This is the real deal. Unique fusion -- like nothing I've had before. All things we tried were amazing. Short rib rice bowl, bao tacos, chorizo egg rolls. Yum. Perfect lunch stop in the Willis tower area to eat local and not overpriced chain food."
"Love the food and service! I tried a little bit of everything. Believe the hype, the curry sweet potato fries and chorizo egg rolls are delicious! Also, the short rib rice bowl with kimchee was flavorful. Justin was one of the cooks, and he brought the food out to us. He was extremely friendly and told us about other gems on the menu. He recommended the tostadas. We will definitely be coming back."
Very very good! I'm sold! I had previous has a bao bun at another location across the street & I was completely turned off. Today's chicken curry bao taco & tostones with salsa were great. Also discovered this place is in the backyard of my employer. Who knew. Friendly & accommodating staff. Keep up the great work:)
Great food. The chorizo rolls are ok. But the bacos are fantastic.Wish it was open longer in the evenings.
"These are lovely, light, pillowy puffs of stark-white dough, surrounding some amazingly-seasoned meats and toppings.The wonderfully-stuffed ""bacos"" are their signature dish - think Wow Boa dumplings shaped like tacos- and they are filled with flavors like pork carnitas ($2.75/baco), Thai Chicken Curry ($2.75), Miso Braised Beef Short Ribs with pineapple salsa ($3.50) and, my favorite, Soy Ginger Tofu ($2.75).But don't stop there! The Miso Braised Short Ribs also come in a huge bowl of rice ($11) and as a sandwich known as ""Domo Arigato"", featuring a mound of perfectly-braised meat on a large French baguette.Other options include a Pork Ramen Soup ($4.70 half bowl, $8.75 full bowl) that is wickedly-spicy, but not in a heat-ful, hurt-ful way. There are several salads as well, including Basil Chicken on romaine ($7) and a gorgeous Beet Salad ($5) that makes an awesome side to any meal.Finally, their Curry Sweet Potato Fries rival the famous D4 Irish Pub's offering as a side dish - they are like nothing you've ever tried, with almost a dessert-like quality. A $3 half/$5 full basket comes  topped with queso fresco and a curry aioli. The place is a tad small and a line forms out the door shortly after 12:15pm - plan on dropping in between 11:30 and noon. If there are no seats available, simply walk across the street to one of the local plazas."
"I love this place.  The people that run this place are super nice.  The food here is really yummy and better yet its not your typical loop spot.  My favorites - their pork ramen, the tofu baos and their nachos.  So good!!!"
"Came to Saucy Porka for a late lunch. It is a fairly small restaurant, but we came after lunch rush and had no problem finding a table. The server/workers were very friendly and open to give their recommendations. We ordered n order of the sweet potato fries, the asian paella and three bacos: pork, tofu, and curry chicken. The hype behind the sweet potato fries are real. For someone like me who likes big and bold flavor, the sweet potato fries were a great combination of tangy from the sauce and sweetness with a good crisp from the fry. The bacos were fairly good, with the protein being the dominating flavor in all of them. I do think that the pinneaple salsa was a little underpowered in the pork bun. I prefer my buns a little softer than what was experienced, but overall,  the buns came together pretty well. The asian paella seemed like a small portion when I first got it, but by the end of the meal, both me and my friend were both full. The paella was pretty good as well, with a great meat to rice ratio. Saucy porka is a tasty lunch option with reasonable prices depending on how much you order. I can definitely see how one might overspend on the variety of tasty appetizers and bacos available though. I wish there was some sort of lunch box option that would combine an entree with a baco/appetizer or something. Note that the food is-in my opinion- more asian than latin in its flavor profile."
Short Rib sandwich and anything  Bao Bun is delicious! Customer service has always been great no matter how busy they get.  I'll definitely be back and highly recommend.
"Saucy Porka used to be my go-to when I worked in the area. For over a year, I ate their incredible sandwiches (the Saucy Porka is definitely their best) and a whole lot of  beet salad, too. The bao tacos are novel, but not nearly the star of their small menu. The short rib sandwich, the ""Domo Arigato"" is great, but a bit more expensive for a lunch sandwich. Good luck getting a table at lunch time, though. The service is relatively fast and they'll do their best to clear one for you, but there's usually a line out of the place for a reason, and the restaurant isn't nearly as big as the lunch demand. Best to take your sandwich and go eat by the CBOT fountain on a sunny day."
"I had the grilled shrimp sandwich. Three stars for the innovative spin on the traditional Banh Mi that you might otherwise find in Saigon or in San Francisco's Tenderloin District.  I appreciate the creativity. Four stars are precluded due to lack of consistency in flavor and composition from bite to bite, one undercooked shrimp, and some wicked-strong garlicky flavor toward the end of the sandwich, giving me some serious -- and unusual -- dragon breath.  There is a great opportunity for them to tighten up their execution. The ideas and ingredients are there for the making. I probably should have tried their spin on tacos, which *looked* good. But, I won't return."
"I was on a work trip and we were visiting Chicago.  After visiting the Willis Tower we were looking for a place to eat.  I of course went on yelp and found the Saucy Porka.  The restaurant is very small with only a few tabels.  Lots of people were taking orders to go, very wise.  We ordered and waited for a table.  The cashier was awesome in recommending dishes and matching your flavor palate and mood to what you should eat.  I loved the food it was great!  You can tell they care about their food and customers.  I would have given them 5 stars but because it was so small and we ended up sitting by the door it was uncomfortable."
This is a cute little place hidden away in the heart of Chicago. The food is great and quick for a short lunch break. The portion sizes are large enough that you could have left overs for a lazy dinner. The pork taco-in-a-bun is delectable! It's wonderfully seasoned. The rice bowls are a tad salty so if you're conscious of your sodium in take maybe not for you... But still definitely tasty! And the service is wonderful and friendly.
"Mexican and Asian fushion what!!!! Thus place was awesome. Their baco was perfect,  their fries were one if the best and their lemonade was amazing. It"
"Amazing! The food is a delightful fusion of Latin & Asian comfort foods. One of those meals that is so delicious that the conversation is centered around the flavors and texture of the food....because you can't help it! The owner, who was the one taking orders at the register, walked around and spoke with every customer. He offered suggestions, he asked how the food was, he asked how people were doing. He proclaimed, ""I LOVE BOSTON"" when I told him that he should open a shop or food truck out here. As if the food wasn't amazing enough, this made it an even better experience. The pork ramen broth was silky and sensuous. The bacos were all creative and fun and tasty. The avocado aioli served with the chorizo egg rolls balanced the flavors wonderfully. If I find myself in Chicago again, I will absolutely return."
"I absolutely love Saucy Porka! I was a little scared when I came here with my coworkers as I had no idea what anything was on the menu, and I didn't really even know what I ordered.The owner recommended that I try the tofu baco, and I hesitantly agreed. CHANGED MY LIFE, people. If you haven't tried the tofu baco, you need to! I liked it so much that the owner gave me another one for free. The sweet potato fries are delicious as well!Overall, I love this place for lunch. The staff is really friendly, the food is good, and the price is reasonable.Now...go get some tofu bacos!"
"So good!Its a nice option when you are looking for something other than a salad or sandwich for lunch. I always want to take a nap afterwards though.I'm still waiting to hear about their second restaurant that was supposed to open in the loop!Favorites: Tofu baos, shrimp & their dessert doughnuts. Nutella & banana and the red bean are great!Caters also, chicken curry is gluten free."
"Excellent selection of Asian-Latin fusion food! I've tried the Ramen, the Sandwiches, the Chorizo egg rolls, and the Baocos. The Ramen is one of my go-to dishes on a cold day, and the Chorizo egg rolls are unlike anything I've tried anywhere else. Great find for a change of pace from the usual loop options for lunch."
Good quick lunch. Pork and chicken backs really good. Chorizo egg roll is great. Regular egg roll was not that great.
"The definition of Mexican Asian fusion. It really says something about how good this place is that I do not use the word 'fusion' sarcastically or not at all. Imagine Wao Bao but instead of the buns being filled like they are rationing meat during the second world war, they injected so much that the whole thing exploded. Definitely get the Pork Carnitas and the Miso Braised Beef Short Rib and skip the Thai Chicken Curry. My coworker also had the Chorizo Egg Roll and gave it mixed reviews.  3 Bacos will be a lunch that I am sure I will have many times in the future, in addition to trying more of the delicious sounding menu."
"Cool little lunch spot in the loop near Quincy & Wells... I opted for three bacos (small tacos, but with a steamed bao bun in lieu of a tortilla) - carnitas, short rib & curry chicken. Actually thought the curry chicken had the best flavor of the three selected... Watched as the rice bowls & sandwiches were delivered, and those looked pretty good as well. Will be back to try other choices, as well as the chorizo egg rolls!"
"Found this place based on the good reviews.  Well,  I love sweet potato fries and one of my pet peeves is when people sugar them up (they're sweet enough as it is!) I LOVED the sweet potato fries here!  There's served with a seasoning and then topped with cheese and chopped scallions and come with a spicy dipping sauce - SO SO GOOD! Got a chicken and pork baco too,  which were also good but the sweet potato fries really stole the show for me.  The lady working was nice and friendly too,  so props for good customer service!"
"I came in just before noon on a Friday and my buddy and I were super lucky to have nabbed a table, though it was literally facing a corner but it's a lot better than eating out of a sack on the street corner so no complaints.I tried the pork carnitas baco and chorizo egg rolls. The chorizo egg rolls were pretty underwhelming; it just didn't have the same kick as the chorizo burritos from my favorite Mexican joints. The onion avocade aioli was a great addition though. I really enjoyed my pork baco. The bun was fluffy and warm, just like with Taiwanese gua bao, if you're familiar with that. They're very generous with their meat so while the baco looks small, it's a lot more filling than a taco which would knock you back $3 as well. It's unfortunate that they're only open 8am-4pm on weekdays, but being in the financial district, there's really no point being open beyond work hours, I guess. Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend grabbing two or three bacos to go on your next lunch break :)"
Great little place for lunch... Just wish it was open on weekends for those of us that live in the neighborhood!
"This place is super yummie. I got the Saucy Pork sandwich and the pork carnitas meat was falling apart tender. Excellent flavors. The sandwich came with either a drink or cassava chips. I opted for the cassava chips but they never gave it to me. So make sure to check your order before leaving here! Also, as  a suggestion, they should cut the sandwich in half so its easier to eat. My sandwich filings were falling out because it was difficult to eat and hold it all in place.I also got a half order of the Curry sweet potato fries with a side of queso cheese (I originally thought it was mayo). Super good! Make sure to use the cheese while its hot, otherwise it chunks up and gets hard which makes it difficult for dipping.The prices here are more on the expensive side, but thats because its located downtown. The sandwich was $8.95 and the fries might have been $3-$5.There is VERY LIMITED seating inside so make sure to go early if you want a seat."
"The owners were kind enough to address my previous review. They were very apologetic and also grateful that I brought to their attention the poor soup serving size. The serving size on my following visit was what I would expect for the price, and the soup of course tasted fantastic, which is why I keep returning. Hopefully both the quantity and quality will remain consistent."
Amazing bahn mi sandwiches. I had the saucy porka and the sweet potato fries. Awesome. Would go again and again and again......
Can I give a 6th star?   I could eat this every day.  Oh wait....I do.  *gobble gobble gobble*Get yourself a Ho-Chi Mihn sandwich and the curry sweet potato fries and thank me later.
"I have been meaning to write this for a while.Overall, fantastic and unique food with great service! Do it now!Price- not bad at all. Bacos are around $3 each and the sandwiches are huge portions.Quality- Phenomenal. Great and unique tastes. I love the ginger and tofu baco, shirt rib baco and the domo arigato sandwich. My friends also love the sweet potato fries and the lemonade. If you can, buy some beignets and ask them to cut it in half- your coworkers will love you and promote you to CEO.Quantity- sandwiches and rice bowls are good portions.Atmosphere- quaint with very decorative flare.Staff- just as good as the food. Ann and Jackie are so welcoming and they work very hard to make sure you're enjoying yourself.Hidden lunch gem. Every time I go, I bring someone new in order to promote the businesses. Be an ambassador of saucy porka."
"Excellent change of pace, did not disappoint. Ordered the short rib rice bowl and sweet potato curry fries. Would get again. Coworker ordered pork rib and curry chicken baco. She would order again as well. Short rib was tender and delicious. As were the sweet potato fries crunchy and the spicy sauce a welcomed addition. Customer service is 5/5, the gentlemen cashier made sure our first visit there was a welcomed one, will go back when in the area."
"Friendly, intimate restaurant tucked on Financial...our family of 3 completely over ordered because we wanted to try everything! Amy helped us narrow down our selections and explained food choices patiently while we made our child claim a coveted table.  Ultimately decided on a small curry sweet potato fries, Ramen, a bao, a Cubano sandwich, Asian paella & the miso braised rib rice bowl. Dishes were flavor packed and hearty. We will definitely return and next time I am ordering a variety of bao sandwiches!"
"As good as they say - sort of a stationary food truck.  Everything I tried was delicious. Try the ginger tofu bao (they call t a baco) it's more like good pork than the white mush you eat when you're broke or on a diet. Also try the daily lemonade.  Owner Michael says they have 8 cooks and can get your order done within 4 minutes even during the lunch rush.  Groups waiting for their friends to get their takeout orders at lunch can make it look more crowded than it is so give it a try. Hard to find- it's behind the Dunkin Donuts west of CBOT, on the street not inside one of the big office buildings."
"This place is a gem. I saw a picture that looked like a bao and I had to drop by. Their miso short rib baco and chorizo egg rolls are absolutely delicious. This is the first place I went to when I moved here and it's still my favorite. The staff is extremely friendly and chill. I can't think of anything negative about this place. I would leave a picture of my food, but I devoured it to fast"
"NOM NOM, oink oink says this lil' piggy.  On occasion I have been known to enjoy a bao from one if the well know bao chicka Wow Bao places in Chicago.  I also like tacos.  Lucky for me Saucy Porka doesn't make me have to choose, they give me ""Bacos"".  Bao Tacos, the cross between a bao stuffed bun and a taco.  I love new food creations.I had a Thai Chicken Curry and a Soy Ginger Tofu baco.  The curry chicken was good, I liked the Asian slaw and the sriracha flavor, it wasn't too overpowering.  The chicken was very moist.  I was a little concerned about the tofu baco, I wasn't thinking it would be a super winner in my book.  Boy was I wrong.  The tofu was seasoned with a soy ginger sauce and avocado aioli and topped with the Asian slaw.  The sauce was thick and densely flavored and the tofu had the most amazing crunchy crust.  I was blown away by the texture and the flavor in this baco.  Tofu never tasted so good."
"Great service! Fast, not greasy food. Thanks to the yelpers who referred us. Sure, there is no bathroom....maybe they can offer those fresh nap wipes (hint hint?) The owner was very humble and helpful. We came in on a Friday about 1pm, so we didn't have to encounter the rush. The only item that was eh was the tofu baco. Highly recommend!"
"Delicious lunch place.The service is way faster than you would expect and they are incredibly friendly.I wish this place was a lot larger but it's downtown so I understand.I tried the ramen, chorizo egg roll, and the miso short ribs.All three were amazing.Their food infusion is genius and I want/need to try out the rest of the menu.Will most certainly be back to try their bao tacos."
"This little gem is hidden in Chicago's financial district and is one few places I've been to that offers steamed buns which are in my opinion, Asian Tacos.One notable about this place is the absolute friendly staff.  The two times I've been there the people that work there have helped me decide what to get and were extremely patient and kind which is sadly a rarity in the F&B business these days. The menu has plenty to choose from in both the form of spicy and mild dishes and if the food isn't spicy enough for your taste, Siracha can be found easily.  The portions are great especially for the cost.  If you're into unique Asian food, this is a must try."
"What fantastic food here. Given the amazing tastes here, I had to wonder why people went next door to Subway to get ho hum sub sandwiches.I got 7 items, and I'll rank them in order of (new word alert) must-getness:1) sofrito shrimp baco, 2) curry sweet potato fries, 3) pork ramen soup, 4) kimchi pork carnita banh mi sandwich, 5) miso short rib baco, 6) chorizo egg roll, 7) pork carnitas baco.The shrimp in the shrimp baco is so good you'll forget your name. The fries were crispy and not limp, and the sauce it comes with is so good it'll make you wanna hit your mama. The pho-style soup is the perfect heat...strong enough kick without being drown-out-all-flavors hot.The baco itself is a neat innovation (taco using a bao instead of a tortilla) but once you've had it, the novelty wears off. Too bad getting a baco is the only way to get my grubby hands on that sofrito shrimp. Wait, what's my name again?Service was outstanding. Attentive and helpful without being arrogant.So why not five stars? Not enough value. Prices are pretty high. Banh mi sandwiches are between $8.25 and $10, most I've ever seen for banh mi (even frou-frou banh mi). Each baco is either $2.75 or $3.50...but the bacos are quite small (about the width of your palm). And soups are $8.75, which is the most I've ever seen for a pho-style soup.So I think that is the reason why people go next door to Subway: it's a cheaper lunch."
The food is unique and delicious. The curry fries are truly where it's at -- I'd recommend getting an extra curry aioli. Everything I've tried here is delicious.The staff are kind and attentive. The staff also takes extra care to make the experience more personalized. I've never had a problem and have always felt welcome.
"Chorizo egg rolls, pork carnitas baco, and miso short rib baco. So good!"
"Good fusion lunch spot.  I like their pork ramen soup, chorizo egg rolls, and when in season, their cuban sandwich.  They have a little bit of space so you can eat there but do get there a little earlier for lunch.  Waits can be about 10 minutes when they get slammed but the food is worth the wait."
One of my favorite lunch time spots!! Have tried just about everything on the menu and love it all ;) my favs: miso short rib rice bowl and the shrimp sandwich (had a much cooler name but I am drawing a blank). Super friendly staff!
"SUCH good food. SUCH friendly, informative and accommodating staff/servers. If I lived in Chicago I would constantly be making excuses to come down to the Financial District just so I could eat here.Got a Vietnamese Coffee, Miso Braised Beef Short Rib Baco (OMG... JUST OMG), Pork Carnitas Baco, half an order of the Pork Ramen Soup (the perfect thing to warm you up in bitter winter weather!), and finished up by sharing an order of the Banana Nutella Beignets with a friend. My friend got The Saucy Porka Banh Mi Sandwich and was also blown away. Amazing flavors, cheap prices, and I will never forget the unique and wonderful texture of the Baco shells... like a giant, savory, puffy marshmallow. I am now on a hunt to find even a mediocre substitute of this place in Miami."
"AZAMING (that's better than ""amazing""). Apparently these folks had a food truck, but I think I missed the boat on that. Glad this place just opened by my office.My coworker and I went for lunch - - she got the chorizo eggrolls and tostones, I got the Asian paella and banana Nutella beignets. We each tried each other's and spent the meal ooh-ing and aah-ing over how great it was, how it was a good value and how we were going to start coming here more often. The paella was delicious and the pork was falling apart and perfect. It was a pretty big portion and I've saved some for dinner tonight. Great flavors, really inventive concept. We loved it and are excited to go back to try something else!"
"Excellent food and even better service! I have been here twice this month and the food has been consistently great. I ordered the arroz con edamame both times and really loved the spice (not heat) in this dish. My co workers ordered the pork ramen and the bao tacos and seemed happy with their food.The service here is much better than other downtown establishments. Let me elaborate - from the cashiers to the person bringing your meal to your table to the person clearing your table, everyone is so sweet and upbeat. Really makes the dining experience so much better!Speaking of tables, there isn't much space at this place so plan ahead and go there before 12 or after 12.30."
"So maybe this is an inflated 4 stars given it's funky name and the uninspired lunch options nearby. But who cares :). Saucy has some good eats, super friendly staff, and a fun menu. I got the miso ribs rice bowl and enjoyed it. Ribs are slightly sweet and comes with some napa cabbage. I also got a side of kimchi which had good flavor but not spicy. The beignets were ok and dense and certainly not a beignet. Maybe I had to eat them right when they came out.Overall, the food is tasty and though won't blow your socks off, it's a place I'll visit again for lunch in the loop."
"SO yum!! Lots of options and all of them are delicious!  Their homemade lemonade is amazing and their service is always delightful, especially justin who always goes above and beyond!!"
"This place is amazing. The staff is very knowledgeable, helpful, and if it's not too crowded the guy comes around and asks you how everything is. Pretty rare for casual dining. They really care about customers. And the food is AMAZING!! I tried it last Friday and I'm hooked. Thank god I work around here because this is definitely my new place to go for lunch. I haven't tried everything (yet) but the Porka sandwich and chorizo eggrolls are great!"
"You really can't go wrong with anything here - the cuisine here is Asian fusion, so it's a mix of Vietnamese, Mexican, Chinese, and French - the latter being mostly the beignets (banana and Nutella are the best!). I usually default to the very filling and very satisfying chorizo egg rolls, but the banh mi sandwiches and bowls are also very flavorful. This place is best for carry-out; it is small and fills up fast with the Loop lunch crowd. If you do manage to grab a seat, they will bring you your dish, and a gentleman who I believe is the owner will circulate throughout the tables and ask if you're enjoying the food. He also will get behind the register and ring up orders at times. It's almost easy to miss, but if you're on Van Buren, it is right past Dunkin Donuts across from the Metra Rock Island train station near a little pizza joint."
"This place is OK. It's new and I do like it-- but I want to go back to try their other dishes. The staff is suuuper nice and accomodating, but they are only open until 4 PM, so that's kind of lame. (Granted, I understand. They are located in the financial district of the loop, so they have no need to be open for dinner.)It's sort of a ""fast casual"" type of restaurant, where you order and pay at the cashier, but they will bring everything to your table. On this visit, I ordered two of the ""bacos"" (If you've ever been to BaoHaus in New York, the bacos are basically Taiwanese style gua bao)-- I think the miso braised short rib and the pork carnitas. I enjoyed the pork more (get anything with pork. It's so good) The miso braised short rib with the pineapple was a little toooo sweet for me, and I didn't taste enough miso. They were also very small portions. You could eat two of these and STILL eat more.I also ordered the pork ramen.The ramen is more pho broth with ramen noodles. It has a bit of a kick to it, but it was great for a rainy day. Let me just reiterate that pork anything here would be a MUST EAT. They are called Saucy Porka for a reason. Get anything with pork. They cook it so well here. The ramen noodles taste packaged, but the pho broth is great. This would be better if it was just straight up pho. I liked the flavor of the broth, but not the noodles. The saving grace of the Saucy Porka are the AZUKI BEIGNETS. I don't think they should call them beignets, as they are not heavy like regular beignets. These are like mini stuffed malasadas, stuffed with azuki beans, condensed milk (I think?) and sex. They are delicious and tasty and get them if they have them!!!!!Other than that, I am EH about Saucy Porka, but will def be back to try more. (I had my eyes on dat paella!)"
"Must try chorizo egg rolls.  Very filling, so share with at least one other.  My Banh Mi, the signautre Saucy Porka, was average.  For me, too much bread on the sandwich.  I will definitely go back and try some others.  It gets fairly crowded over lunch but the tables turn very quickly and the service is excellent."
"I can not believe that this week was my first time ever visiting this place. It rashly didn't get any better for a stop in lunch shoot. I took my husband here for his surprise bday lunch since it was pretty close to him office. Not only was the staff/owner? incredibly helpful in giving us some suggestions, so nice about it as well! The food was incredible most importantly, I guess. We had the cubana, shrimp and steak tacos, sweet potato fries, miso braised beef and the must try egg rolls and wow! It was all so yum yum yum! All the meet was so tender and flavorful and there was nothing there that I wouldn't try again. Doesn't get any better than this people!"
"Saucy Porka embodies everything that I love about Yelp.  It's a hole in the wall restaurant on S. Financial Place that I normally wouldn't give a second thought to, especially since it has the obligatory ""No Public Restrooms Here"" sign that tends to pop up on slightly sketchy side streets.The service is spectacular.  Our server was cute and quirky and had excellent recommendations.  She went on her lunch break shortly after we arrived and sat by us to chat.Food.  I dream of bacos and curry sweet potato fries.  Get the Sofrito Marinated Shrimp baco with Asian slaw (screw it, get five of them).  Deliciousness galore!Saucy Porka - love ya!"
My and my girl fist visited the unique and wonderful establishment on Valentine's Day for lunch. Everything on the menu looked so good that we got many things and shared.  All the food was a new taste experience and was fantastic.  My personal favorite was the signature saucy porka sandwich which is pulled pork with kimchi and the beef short rib baco which is similar to a taco only with a super soft fluffy bread as the shell. I will be going back soon and regularly. If you're ever in the south loop and looking for a new and flavorful food place they are well worth it.
"Good pho but very greasy. The pork belly baco was delicious but also a little on the greasy side. Place fills up during lunch, not really a good place around lunch time for groups larger than 4."
Surprisingly good food! Went during lunch hour on a Wednesday and the wait was not bad at all... 10 minutes or so... The menu is very unique and oozes Latin-Asian fusion. I got the Asian Paella which was basically a yellow fried rice with 2 kinds of sausage mixed in and topped with carnitas. The flavors were excellent! Unfortunately everything on the menu is a little overpriced...  And you should expect to spend around $12-15 for a filling lunch and a drink ...
"Chorizo egg roll?! Yes, please. They are fried bits of heaven. Saucy porka is one of my favorite lunchtime venues in the Loop. Everything I've had here is incredible, but the standouts are definitely the aforementioned egg roll, and the arroz con edemame. I always intend to save half the rice bowls for a snack or light meal later on in the day, but they are too good to save. Also great are the Bahn Mi sandwiches, and the braised short rib Baco is superb.Service is polite, fast. I love going there."
"I went with a friend to the soft launch and absolutely loved it. Everything we ate (3 apps, 2 mains, and 2 cupcakes) was delicious. The prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food you get. I did miss a little heat or saltiness in the nachos, but that's if I'm being super picky.In this area, it's hard to find fresh and interesting dishes. I'll be walking here for lunch often. There are several other items on the menu that I am excited to try, so I'll be back soon for sure."
"One of my favorite lunch spots in the Loop. The pork and short rib bacos are my favorite, and the chorizo eggrolls are amazing. Greasy, but amazing. My boyfriend does not usually like chorizo, but I forced him to try them and he is a huge fan. He ordered them for lunch today in fact. He also tried the shrimp baco, which I tried for the first time. I can see how it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but we both thought it was nice and light. Nothing super special, but nice flavors that complimented the shrimp.I have had the ramen now a few times and I love it. Reminds me of a combo ramen and pho. Large portions too! A half portion probably 3-4 cups of soup!I ate in the restaurant for the first time today, and I have to say the service is amazing. The people taking your order are always nice, and I was pleasantly surprised to find out they are also amazing servers for being such a small fast food place in the Loop. The same guy took our order as who brought it to our table and he was very genuinely enthusiastic and loving life. He even asked if I was left or right handed and placed my silverwear on the corresponding side of my food! Talk about service. They made sure that everything was good and well during our meal and cleaned up after us. I am thoroughly impressed."
"This is by far the best lunch spot I have tried in the Loop. Most of the food downtown is boring and average at best, and I perused through Yelp last week hoping to find a change of pace. I am so happy I found this gem, though disappointed it took me so long, cause I've been to Chicken Planet right around the corner from here several times in the past few months and never noticed it.I ordered two bao tacos - pork carnitas and short rib. Both were marinated and sprinkled with little chunks of pineapple. The meat was unbelievably tasty, juicy, and just fell apart like good short rib should do. I also had the pork ramen soup, which was like a combination of pho and ramen with some fresh jalapenos. That was also insanely delicious, with just a fantastic combination of flavors.I plan to become a regular here, as long as the quality is consistent with my first visit!"
"I have 4 words for this place: BEST. LOOP. LUNCH. EVER. It's not often that during my lunch I'm already planning my next visit to that very spot. While at Saucy Porka, I was really wishing it was open for dinner, so I could get it AGAIN that night. The flavors are divine. Please try the Asian style paella (with a little sriracha), the curry sweet potato fries, and a few different kinds of bacos. If you do, you'll be a believer. Make sure to come a little before or a little after the regular lunch rush time of 12-1 or expect to wait in line for a few minutes. Even so, the service is quick and friendly, and your food will be amazing. Not an exaggeration... AMAZING. Just... hurry up and go here."
Bacos = incredibleChorizo egg roles = what the the what? DeliciousBeef ramen = could eat this every day of my lifeThe people are super sweet. The lady behind the counter remembered my name after only going there twice. They're more than happy to spend the time to find exactly what you're looking for. Love this place!
I really like the sweet potato fries ! Try the different Taco Bun things . They are a lot more filling than you think !
"Wow!  I haven't been blown away by lunch in the loop since, well EVER! This place was simply amazing. I've tried duck n roll before and was not overly impressed with it., but the food at SP was another story.  Pretty sure the difference lies with carrying food back to the office vs. eating it within minutes after it's prepared.  We ordered:Chorizo Egg RollsCurry Sweet Potato FriesSofrito marinated Shrimp BacoMiso Braised Beef Short RibThe Saucy Porka Banh MiEverything was foodgasm.  We were sorta disappointed with the Egg Rolls but that's cause we have very high expectations for them after reading about it in the trib.  Nevertheless, everything had great flavor.  My friend who has never tried kimchi before took my advice on getting the kimchi (that came with the porka sandwich on the side).  At first he was a little hesitant on the flavor, but after trying it with the sandwich, he quickly dumped the entire container of kim chi over his sandwich.  The fries were probably the highlight of the meal.  I've had sweet potato fries before, but never like this.  Usually the concept of using sweet potatos for fries is good, but poorly executed.  They come out too soggy and lack the crunch needed for fries. not these.  The queso fresco cheese was kind of a lost element though.  I definitely will be coming back to try the Umami Nachos and some of the rice bowls."
"Yes! Yes! Yes!Flavorful.  Excellent choices.  Great prices.  Quick service.  Friendly.  Soda fountain, can, or bottle.I really don't expect much from a restaurant with a menu the size of the dining room.  So when I walked in here and saw this small menu w/ maybe 15 things on it, I felt my spirits rise.  When the lady at the register not only called out to those of us against the wall trying to decide what to get before advancing to the wall, but she began to walk around the counter to come out and get us with the plan to educate, my spirits rose even higher.  When I expressed to her that this was my first time, and I really wanted to get a feel for the place, she didn't just come back with a patent line.  Instead, she began to give a quick suggest on how to proceed, what was a good quantity for someone my size, and she did it in a helpful, time-saving manner, I was soaring!Here is the first thought, you want to get the right amount of food at a great price, get one of the meals on the right.  If you want to sample, choose around 3 Bao Tacos from the middle column.  So, I got three Bao Tacos: Pork Carnitas, Thai Chicken Curry, Miso Braised Beef Short Rib.  Total price was about $9 w/ tax.  My buddy got a meal w/ a drink for about the same.The restaurant was packed.  All the tables were filled, people were standing online for their food to be ready, other people were waiting to order.  So of course, our food was ready in about 2 minutes.  Seriously!  We didn't even have enough time to start a conversation and the food was ready.  We walked across the street, sat on a wall, and ate.  Out of the three, my favorite was all three.  If had to start with anyone of them and finish with any other one, I'd be happy with whatever order.  They are just perfect!The bread is just a little sweet.  The meat is just a little spicy.  The extras are just a little messy, but not too much.  Three is just the right amount.  You simply have to try it"
"Too much fat on the ribs sandwich IMO. Owner is nice - asked me if everything was good after I left half the ""meat"" in the sandwich on the plate, and I said it was OK but not more and told him about the fat. He gave me a free appetizer for next time. That's customer service."
"Yum! Good place for lunch (quick), super friendly staff and delish food. I scour the south loop for places with good gluten free options and this one would be on the list."
"I'm a stickler so I don't give out too many 5 stars; especially for lunch. So consider this a 5 star rating. The food is excellent. I've been here twice and I've tried the chorizo egg rolls, the pho, the bacos and the short rib rice bowl, and it's all great, especially as a lunch option. It is on a short list of restaurants most people in the city will never hear about, given its location; I feel sad for those people :)"
"Wowsa!This is like hitting the trifecta...Good food, reasonable price, and nice staff!I ordered the Basil Chicken Salad; nice and light, very fresh and the dressing was just enough. Also ordered Short Rib Bao Taco - oh my; soft and succulent beef w/ light and fluffy bao style ""taco shell"" I finished off with Banana Nutella Beignet - It's more like a Beignet-shape Churro with fillings, you get 2 per order and 1 is more than enough after what I had for lunch!Big fan here - going back again next week for sure!Oh yeah and service is very quick, efficient and super nice staff!"
"Went here for lunch today and I will definitely go back.  I had the arroz con edamame per the suggestion of someone who works there.  I loved it, the soy ginger tofu is super delicious and the rice is vegetarian which is a huge plus! It was also nice that I waited less than 2 min in line, a serious feat during lunch downtown."
"I can't think of a single place in the loop that is this good. Saw this on Chicago's Best or something over the weekend and had to try it. Well worth the 10 minute walk and $10 for the Asian style paella.I'm pretty sure I'm sending them a ton of new business, too, since everyone in my office is asking me where I got my food.Co-workers got the miso short rib rice bowl and three ""bacos""--rave reviews all around.The reviews mentioning the service are spot on, too. We came before the lunch rush, and the owner took our orders. Just friendly, welcoming. Everything you'd want in a quick lunch place.I will be back. Often."
"Oh myyyyyyy. The sweet potato fries (curry, queso fresco) are amazingly tasty and addicting. Even a small portion is gigantic.Their take on the cuban sandwich is excellent. Ham, garlic pork, onions, jalapeno mayo - just excellent. A little hot sauce made it pop.Service here is great. Everyone cares about the customer and is extra friendly. Lots of people packed in the place and they don't miss a beat.I'm really excited to see a good non-chain lunch spot really hitting a home run. Like Frederica B. says, it's the kind of place you really want to succeed."
Decent prices but food wasn't memorable.
Incredible and unique food. Any of the bacos are great but I really enjoyed the curry chicken. The beet salad had a great dressing & large portions. Not to mention the ultra friendly staff. Gotta try this place!
"Five of my coworkers and I visited Saucy Porka for lunch, and we were all immediate fans. Even during the lunch rush, we lucked out getting a table to seat us all, thanks to a staff person who helped us push two tables together. Saucy Porka's menu is unique and well priced for our ""under $10"" rule. The table was split: some got Bacos, others got Banh Mi, another got the Beet Salad which got a good review. For the Bacos, I recommend that you opt for the short rib over the chicken or pork. I haven't tried the shrimp or tofu, so I can't speak to those. Next time, I'll try the Banh Mi for myself!"
"Amazing! Love the chorizo egg rolls and the pork baco. The curry baco was good too, but maybe not style. Two bacos and the egg rolls totaled just under $10, and left me feeling full and satisfied. Definitely will be back again!"
"I was really excited to try this place but I guess I set my standards to high when I went. The food was good but not too amazing. The bacos are small. The miso short ribs were good but had pieces of fat in each bite. Choizo egg roll was the best out of what we tried. Overall good food and great service, just not over the top like yelp reviews mislead me."
"This is the kind of place that is so great you really want it to succeed. The staff is very friendly even in the thick of the lunch rush. The meat on the sandwiches here is extremely tender and juicy, some of the best I've ever had. The beignets are large and don't skimp on the filings. The blueberries in the beignet were fresh and plump. The food is a little more expensive than other places downtown but, I feel like the quality of ingredients excuses that.Tables were kept clean and hand sanitizer is provided for patrons. I was impressed they were able to keep everything so clean even though it was so busy.   Keep in mind, there is no public restroom. However, this is no fault of their own since they are leasing a portion of the building so they have no control over that.This was my second visit and I'll definitely be back for a third."
My first time here and hopefully many more to come. The short rib paella was amazing! An explosion of flavor
"This place is great!  Food was delicious, service was ridiculously good, and concept was creatively fun.  Came with my family for lunch on a Tuesday at 1 pm and had no problem grabbing a table, although we would have happily taken it to go at the park nearby.  Kids tried the bacos - one loved them and one thought the puffy shells were not to their taste - but the owner ran over and offered to put the filling into a ""regular"" taco shell when he noticed my son not eating.  So amazingly thoughtful.  I loved the asian paella - very flavorful.  And my dad thought the chicken bahn mi was very tasty.  Try this place if you want something a little different and want to be doted on by thoughtful owners.  We loved the experience."
"Latin-Asian fusion, sign me up.  Skip the nachos, but everything else on the menu is delicious. If they have the lemonade mojito that day... get it.  The bao tacos were all good, as were the sweet potato fries.  I'll be back to try one  of the manybanh mi sandwiches which my coworker thoroughly enjoyed. Nice addition to the financial district lunch options."
This place is AMAZING!  Go there and eat everything and then stay post-lunch rush to chat it up with all the nice people working there.  BYOB too!  Not your typical Loop lunch eatery.
Plenty of exciting good choices. I had the 'Bacos' and they were all delicious. I especially like the Thai chicken curry baco
"The Saucy Porka is my new hidden gem for lunch in the loop. I had the saucy porka sandwich and it is a really flavorful sandwich. I was unsure of the kimchi at first, but the more I indulged, the more and more I liked it. For a side, I had the sweet potato fries with queso fresco. This was my first time, but I anticipate trying many many other things here. The whole menu looks really good and service is really friendly here."
"delicious, and so creative! i'm vegetarian and loved the tofu tacos, in a steamed bun and beautifully seasoned."
"Went here for lunch. Tried 3 bacos. Shrimp, Carnitas, and short rib. All were great, shrimp was my favorite. Only issue was price. It was about 13.50 for 3 bacos and a coke, which if you are pretty hungry you could easily get four since they were a little smaller than expected."
"Saucy Porka, with a name like that how could it not be good?!?  The concept behind the restaurant is a fusion of Latin and Asian traditional dishes with a modern twist.  The chefs have pulled together bold flavors rooted from Puerto Rico, South East Asia, China, Japan and Korea looking to serve comfort foods they grew up with, adding modern twist to fuse the cultures.When you walk into the place you are immediately hit by an array of mouthwatering aromas; followed by the realization that you will have to wait for a table as this place gets busy, and for good reason.  As a general rule of thumb when eating out, any place that locals (in this case Chicagoans) are willing to wait for a meal is usually worth the wait.  Everyone working there is hustling about to make sure food orders are taken and prepared quickly, while making sure to serve quality in every bite.So now to the fun part, eating!  The menu is very diverse, ranging from Asian paella and curried sweet potato fries to my favorite, ""Bacos.""  What are Bacos you ask? Like  I said, this place is Asian/Latin fusion so a Baco is simply a twist on a taco.  There are five options offered; Pork Carnitas topped with pineapple salsa, Thai Chicken Curry topped with pickled Asian slaw served, Miso Braised Beef Short Rib topped with pineapple salsa, Soy Ginger Tofu topped with pickled Asian slaw (vegetarian) and Sofrito Marinated Shrimp topped with Asian slaw served.  Mouth watering. Each variation is served on a steamed Bao bun.  If you aren't craving at least one....Read more at 2views1life.blogspot.com…"
"I really loved the Chorizo Egg Roll.  mmmm MMMMM!  The Saucy Porka  was also really tasty, but I might go without kimchi next time -- not that I don't like kimchi, but I just don't need it on this sandwich.  The carnitas were good and tender, bread was crisp on the outside and did a good job of absorbing all the pork sauce.  BUT THE CHORIZO EGG ROLL with that avocado aioli. . . my word!  Amazing!"
"Good food, reasonable prices for the Loop, friendly staff. A mix of Latin and Asian cuisines, pretty much everything has been tasty the times we've been here; a nice mix of handhelds and bowls keep the menu interesting on return visits. The most difficult thing here is snagging a table, especially if you go  during prime lunch hours."
The shrimp baco and short rib one taste really good. But never enough for having a FULL meal.
"This place is definitely unique! Went there for lunch on NYE. I got a vegetarian egg roll which was a bit sweet but still good. I loved the avocado aioli. I had the sofrito shrimp baco which I loved! The bao bun was something I never had before and it was delicious. My boyfriend got a Ho Chi Minh with soy ginger tofu sandwich! It was good but very sweet. If you are in the area, make sure to get the bacos! They were the best. The owners were friendly and provided great service!"
"A friend took me here yesterday, saying it was ""Asian meets Mexican"".  Admittedly, I was skeptical. Delish.  Will be added to my regulars.Some of the places in this area can be sketch.  Not this place.  You walk in the door and you're surrounded by amazing smells and even better food.Get the bacos.  You probably need 3.  Or two plus an egg roll.  Or get it all because it's delish. ***minimal seating here, so you may want to get this to go."
"Saucy Porka is right up my alley.  Excellent food, healthy options, no one really knows about it and it has a weird name.  One thing to note is that the Saucy Porka is not a cheap lunch spot.I ordered the ramen to go which was ok.  The noodles weren't Japanese noodles, they were the noodles that come in the packs.  But the flavors were good and the broth had some kick.  Next time if I want soup I'll probably just go to Bahn Mi around the corner.I also ordered a pork belly baco and woooaaaahhh baby that little sucker was delicious!  It was $3.75 which was steep for just one but it is filled with tons of meat.  I could maybe order three of those for lunch.  That would put my lunch + tax somewhere around $13 which was what I paid for the soup and baco.  I will be back when I am rich!"
"Another new asian joint by my office - Awesome.Let's get straight to the one negative - Saucy Porka is a bit pricey. But it's definitely worth it for a good lunch every so often, and a lot of items are worth the price of admission.  The namesake Saucy Porka sandwich has delicious, tender pork carnitas that really is the star of the show. I do wish they would throw some more kimchi on top...but that's probably because I grew up on the stuff and can't get enough. The asian paella is tasty, but I think it's missing something with a little kick - an element of heat/spice would really elevate this dish. The short ribs - so tender, it melts in your mouth. I'm not as impressed with the Bacos as a full meal, but getting one as a complement to your dish (say, the asian paella with a Miso Braised Beef Short Rib baco...then it definitely makes for a filling, satisfying meal.I'm happy that this is around the office, and it's a good option, and definitely passes the test for a place if you want to go to a nicer lunch in the loop (technically just outside of the loop) that isn't a fast food or similar type of chain."
"This is quite a hike from where I work, but its awesome.  A little pricey for lunch, but the food is tasty."
Big fan. I had the basil chicken salad and the chorizo egg rolls with avocado aioli. I will be dreaming of these egg rolls. There were absolutely ameowzing. Plus everyone who helped me was positive and upbeat. I left with a smile on my face and a happy tummy! I will definitely be recommending this place to my friends and coworkers.
"Fantastic! I heard about this place through a co-worker, but it's only open during the day and hard for me to reach during work. So on a day off, I met a friend there for lunch. Terrific, with friendly, helpful staff. I had a bahn mi sandwich and the beet salad. My friend had a rice bowl and the chorizo egg rolls. We shared the beignets. The food is so fresh, and flavorful. And staff are really attentive to ensuring a good experience. You must go!  Note, we got there at about 1:20 and it was still packed. So I suspect the noon lunch rush is insane."
"I've had food that I would describe as excellent and food I would describe as good at Saucy Porka. One thing they do have going for them is what they are doing is so unique (Vietnamese/Latin mix?), there's really no comparison. Really, my only disappointment with this place is the shrimp bahn mi sandwich, which is $11 and very, very light on shrimp. I know shrimp is expensive, but they should probably add so more asian slaw so you don't feel like you're just eating bread. Great service, great and unique food. There's not a lot of seating, so if you going during the lunch hour, say around noon, be prepared to take it to go."
"My co-workers know that even if I brought a lunch and say I don't want to spend the money on going out, there are only two words they need to use to change my mind: Saucy. Porka.I found out about this place when we decided to cater in from here for a working lunch. The whole idea of latin and asian fusion made it sound like food poisoning waiting to happen. Regardless, it gave me the chance to try all the bacos, but of all I love the veggie egg rolls. Veggie Eggrolls? What's so special about those?EVERYTHING. Mushrooms and sweet potato and yumminess wrapped up in an epically perfect wonton wrapper, served with this green sauce. The flavors come together in such a magical way. Perfecto!Bacos are great (curry chicken is my favorite) and the chorizo egg rolls are great too. Also, very Vegetarian friendly."
"I ador-a Saucy Porka.First thing with any restaurant is the location. By being off the beaten path (and I'm sure a 20 degree day didn't help) the place had a good capacity but not overly so. Given that it's pretty small with about 10 tables, was a plus. I tried the three most popular tacos (curry chicken, short rib and pork) as well as the sweet potato fries. Everything was very flavorful and relatively simple, which I like. When I go there again, I'm going to stick to the pork Bacos (bao tacos) and sweet potato fries."
"Holy Pork Ramen!  The best I have ever had in Chicago or anywhere else.  The flavors are so delish that I crave the Ramen for days after I stop in.  They are PACKED for lunch, if you are not there by 11:45 you will probably be waiting in the line that goes out the door and around the corner.  The wait is worth it.  Seating is minimal and patrons are far from considerate (camping at tables long after they are done eating).  The staff is amazing!  I am pretty sure the gentleman taking orders is the owner and I am pretty sure it is his daughter next to him.  The guys that walk the floor coordinating tables, and keeping everyone happy are AWESOME.  Just writing this review makes me want the ramen...that's it, I am going there for lunch today!"
"This is the easiest 5 stars I've ever given. Highly recommended.If it's before 4pm M-F, STOP wasting your time reading what will no doubt be a gushing review and just go eat there.I tried Saucy Porka for the first time a month ago. LOVE. The At-First-Sight kind. In the weeks since, I've eaten there at least twice a week (I work down the street) and have sampled all the sandwiches, all of the bacos (bao+taco=baco!), and most of the sides. None of them were anything less then mouthwateringly, I-have-to-tweet-about-this-right-now delicious. Are you still reading? Again, just stop and go actually eat instead of fantasy eating. The menu is not large, but it is very well curated (a much harder skill than a ""everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach). The miso braised short ribs are a central component in of many of the main dishes, including a baco, a sandwich, and the Asian paella, all of which are excellent. The meat is high quality and just melts in the umami zone of your tongue. The sofrito shrimp is exceptional in this way too. All of the bacos and sandwiches are topped with kimchi or their house blend of cabbage, both of which provide a crisp counterpoint to the tenderness of the meat and the light airiness of the french bread and baco. It all comes together into one of the best, most wonderful mouth feels you'll ever have. The sweet potato fries are my go-to side. I've never been a huge believer in sweet potato fries, but these are perfectly flavored and baked to pair with the main dishes. For dessert, try the azuki beignets.They call them ""donut holes"" but they're actually pretty substantial in size. After the mains, one is more than enough for me (though, I've never been good at self restraint).The interior has bar table seating for about two dozen and is beautifully decorated and very homey. Family pictures adorn the walls and Etta James plays over the radio. The staff is always wonderful (and considering how much I've seen these people over the last month, it is doubly impressive).I can't say enough good things about this place. Honestly, I partly held off Yelping about it because I don't want you coming and making me wait longer in line. But, alas, I owe it to Saucy Porka and to you to spread the good word."
Delicious!  The Arroz con Edamane/pork was amazing!  My daughter had  the pork Ramen soup and thought it was savory with perfect meat.  My husband was turned on to kim chi with the carnita pork.  It was a popular item being ordered by many diners.
I think this place is really good.  The food fusion they have going is great.  Limited space to sit and dine but nevertheless it taste amazing.  There are a thousand place to get a burger or taco around here but this place is unique and definitely attracts a lot of people.  I believe the food is a fusion of Asian and Latin food.  The food taste good and the portions are generous.  They have some Vietnamese sandwiches which also is particularly good.  If its quantity and taste then go for the rice bowl.
Excellent food. We never try spicy food but this place is a such extraordinary exception. The only thing against them is they don't have bathroom for customers
Eponymous sandwich. Little spicy. Good bread. Tender porka. Very nice.
Pretty good food. Had the saucy porka which was a bit more simple than I thought it would have been. Just carnitas and kimchi (I didn't get mayo which is the only other thing it comes with). The bacos are good. Also had the basil chicken salad which was also pretty good too.
"Came here for lunch today and ordered the saucy porka sandwich (banhmi with carnitas and kimchi). I found it pretty tasty, but I wish it had cilantro and pickled daikon...or even cucumber would be good. I felt it was missing something fresh and crispy. The pork was tasty and very well seasoned but I felt the sandwich was a bit heavy with the bread, kimchi and pork. Something a bit more tart and sweet would be a great accompaniment. I love pork and kimchi on their own, perhaps the bread just made the whole thing more heavy. The nachos and the bao tacos all looked great. I will have to stop in to try more items. BTW, this place is small and seating is a bit limited so it might not be a good place for a large group if you're planning on sitting."
"Really great mix of Asian and Puerto Rican cuisine. So far I have had the Asian Paella, which has a bunch of Chinese sausage, short rib, in a yellow rice mix with edamame beans. It's a really tasty dish, and a good amount of food for lunch. I also had the breakfast banh mi with chorizo and a sunny side egg on top. It's delicious. The bacos (bao tacos) and other banh mis are also great.Outside of the entrees, the beignets are awesome. I recommend the Azuki bean cinnamon flavor. Overall, it's a fantastic lunch spot with unique flavors."
"Swung by the new Saucy Porka for lunch - as a big fan of Amy Le of Duck N' Roll food truck - was eagerly awaiting this opening and was not disappointed. The braised short rib bao/baco was a great combination of savory flavor with a bit of spice. The bun itself was a great compliment to short rib, soft and sweet. The chicken salad was a light (as in healthy) but filling way to finish the lunch. Overall, the space has a warm feel - great to tuck away and escape the busy day with a delicious lunch."
"I am fortunate enough to work a few blocks away from this restaurant and buy a sandwich or baco almost everyday... And I never cease to be impressed. I had their Cuban sandwich this afternoon and it was probably the best I have had. Most of the other sandwiches are delicious and light, made with healthy and fresh ingredients. Considering the quality everything is reasonably priced. Great spot!"
"Sweet jesus - this place just blew my mind! That was the best quick lunch ive had in the Loop in years.  Everything was better than the last thing I tried.  I almost don't want to post to keep the line at a minimum, but it was too tasty to not post!"
"5 stars for a great lunch spot. The ramen was good, but my friend had the miso-braised pork over rice that he liked. I'll be here once a week!"
"This place is a wonderful lunch option that's a bit different than the usual sandwich/soup/salad place. My co-workers and I came here for lunch around 11:30 on a Monday and there was no wait and enough room for the 4 of us to fit at a table (one worker even pulled us together some tables so we'd fit comfortably). I got the sweet potato fries, chicken curry baco, and short rib baco for about $12, all of which were good. My co-workers loved the sweet potato fries and their sandwich. I thought the bacos both had good flavor, but could use slightly more flavor to counteract how thick the bao buns are. All the food is super filling for a really good price.Overall I think it's worth a visit for the really awesome customer service and to try out the bacos, which are a bit different. My co-worker already said he wants to come back to try out the rice bowls. They also offer catering, which I could see being a great option as they have many vegetarian options.A word of warning- it's can be a bit hard to find. It's 3 doors down on S. Financial Place south of Van Buren."
"Wow. Rare for me to give 5 stars but this food is just off the charts for its kind.Visited late afternoon and got to chat with the owners...great folks that really care about what they serve. Paella and an order of chorizo egg rolls put me into a zesty bliss.Just an hour since arrival and I already have enough reason to have come to Chicago.Particular shout out to Rafael, a wonderful host.Go here. Eat. Talk. Enjoy."
"This place is Great! Went there for the first time today and tried the following;Miso Braised Shortrib Baco - Good flavors, but needs siracha to tone down the sweet pineappleCarnitas Baco - Absolutely great flavors!!!Sofrito Shrip Baco - Another really really good item to try.Chorizo Egg Roll - I love chorizo, so I had to give it a shot. Highly recommended.Last but probably now my office's favorite is the Bannan Nutela Donut Holes - Totaly outstanding!I'll be coming here regularly."
"I got the Saucy Porka sandwich. It was interesting! It was like the bahn mi vietnamese meat in a sandwich style, with some korean kimchi on it! Definitely Asian Fusion. It was actually pretty good! The staff was very nice as well."
I work very close by and wanted to try an alternative to the standard places in the area. The place looked interesting and unique from the outside so I thought I would give it a shot.All I can say is wow! I was blown away by the Saucy Porka sandwich (Pork Carnitas and Kimchi with some sauce on a baguette). The sandwich was made to perfection with tender slow cooked pork which was complemented perfectly by the tanginess of the fresh kimchi. A very filling portion for lunch but leaves you craving for more given how tasty it was.Update: I went back and had the cuban sandwich - slow roasted pork and tender ham with onions and a special mayonaise. Couldn't have been prepared better - my mouth is still salivating from that experience. I think I have fallen in love again.
I work nearby and grabbed lunch here today. The pork ramen soup was so tasty! Even better than the soup was the service! We had the nicest server (Jackie) and two other staff members (a cook and the owner I think) came to our table asking how everything was and thanking us for our business...great people! The only downside was the space. The place was packed and there are only a few tables.
This is a great lunch location regardless of the season! I dream of their soy ginger fried baco and sweet potato fries.
"Saucy Porka is a gift from god for this area!I've been here a number of times and it never fails to amaze me!  It's always been super busy the time I go (weekdays 12p-1p), but all the staff are extremely friendly, and the owner, Michael, has even come round and asked if everything has been satisfactory. Whenever I go I always order the Pork Carnitas Bacos or the Ho Chi Minh Banh Mi...Both have been out of this world...The Bacos are genius! The Banh Mi was great, but it has been a little soggy. Either way, the flavours always hit the right spots!Hope this place lives a long life in Chicago!"
Loved the food! The pork carnitas are wonderful in everything!  We ordered the Pork Ramen and then Saucy Porka sandwich.  Could eat this for days and days!
It was delicious.  The owners are fabulous as well.  They really make you feel like family.  The food was fresh and prepared with just enough of everything.  I will go again and recommend to all my friends.  Really nice!!!
"Overall decent Asian fusion flavors at typical Loop prices. 4 stars for the friendly service, tasty braised ribs rice bowl and sufficient number of menu options."
"SO F'ING GOOD! What a great concept! Little Chinese Bao bun tacos, egg rolls, fun sides and...what did you say, beignets?!? I've hit Saucy several times since I first started working in the Loop back in October and it's been deliciously fresh and different on each visit. Each employee seems truly excited to work in this fast-paced little place and it shows in the food. Can't wait to get back once it's warm enough to walk that far for lunch again! Bravo!"
"Owner is awesome.  Comes out asks how you are and how the food was.  Food comes out fast!  The buns are off the chain, i've had chicken, shrimp and short rib, they are all hits.  Pork shoulder/kimchee nachos are slamming and good for a group to split.  The Saucy Porka Sandwich is packed with flavor, is fairly sweet and is so good.  A little high on the price, but you pay for what you get.  I have visited with two colleagues and both loved it.  Also, the music is excellent with a cool vibe and plenty of 90's and under ground hip-hop to keep you mellow (loved the Mos Def tri-fecta when I was there last).  Mmmmmmmmm!  I'll be back!"
"What a welcome add to the downtown lunch scene!  Finally, a place that gets it right:  awesome food; a super nice bunch of folks and a comfortable vibe. Saucy Porka fuses Latin and Korean tastes.  Their chorizo egg rolls with avocado aioli sauce are a super side/starter to any dish.  The Domo Arigato sandwich is the best Banh Mi-take i've had -- with a terrific balance of crunchy/soft bread (not too much!), braised short rib and Asian slaw.  An extra hit of Siracha (readily available) takes it to the moon.  I'd eat it every day (and have been!).Saucy Porka's ramen is another super-savory choice -- with the short ribs again adding flavor and satisfaction.  You can't go wrong with that one.Finally -- while the food is for sure enough of a draw, a special thanks to Michael (co-owner).  From the beginning, he's always there to help with suggestions and a sincere thank you for being there at his place.  That's the way to run a successful business, Michael.  Keep leading the way!I'm off again to try something new.  This time the pozole soup I think."
"Great concept with well thought out and executed menu. Had the chorizo egg rolls which were awesome, came with a great green sauce. Also had a short rib baco, which was amazing. Short ribs cooked perfectly, great with the pineapple and green onion garnish. Can't wait to go back and try some new dishes!"
"One word: ""Yum!"""
"Was Downtown for training and ducked in here during the lunch rush. Even though it was crowded, the service was quick. Great mix of Latino and Asian flavors.I had the Saucy Porka, and I had to try the Curry Sweet Potato Fries. My lunch partner let me steal some of her Chorizo Egg Roll. All of it was excellent. The only bad part was I had to sit through hours of boring training the rest of the day.Great service: When I asked if they had a mint for a breath freshener, they gave me instead some complimentary fresh basil."
Wow! Great new lunch place.  Try the arroz with edamame.  It's like fried rice with a protein topping.  The curry chicken is excellent - really tender/fall apart chicken and a lot of great flavors.  Really hit the spot.  It does take awhile after you order so just be prepared for that.164/365
"Great food!  I will be back for another breakfast sandwich, and lunch.  The aroma inside this place is great.  Yes, the staff is extremely friendly.  The place is not open on weekends yet.  This is worth a visit."
"I also was there for the soft launch party. All I can say is the food is awesome.  This is an Amy Le production. Amy also started Duck N Roll, a Chicago food truck, which shares some of the items on the menu.That evening, I had the vegetarian egg rolls, curry sweet potato fries, and the Ho Chi Minh (curry chicken served on a French baguette with pickled Asian slaw). Everything was super flavorful, but not in an over the top authentic kind of way.I can also confirm that  the rice bowls entrees are solid, with two of my friends giving them 5 stars. We all indulged in dessert - both the beignets and cupcakes are fantastic.The ambiance is trendy, but very casual. I picked up a few songs thanks to Shazam.There is a Ticker LED display so this place is definitely trying to be trader-friendly. They are going to be open as early as 8am, and will be serving  Banh Mi breakfast sandwiches.  Definitely will be back, maybe as I pick up a coffee at DD next door."
"Saucy Porka is amazing. I heard about it from my boss last Friday morning and immediately went there for lunch. I had the miso braised beef tacos, plantains, chorizo egg rolls, and the shrimp taco. It was all fantastic! We also ended up ordering the banana nutella waffles - delicious! I can't wait to go back."
"Definitely as good as it gets.  Great variety of foods, high quality, and the people there are just so nice, going out of their way to make sure you have what you need.  Chorizo Egg Roles? dynamite.  There is definitely something addictive about them.Pork Ramen? Rich & tasty broth and a lot of meat...no skimping here.  Looking forward to heading back...too bad I waited this long."
"Absolutely one of the best lunch spots in the Loop. Everything they make is fresh, on a near daily basis. As an example of how amazingly authentic this place is, they import three different kinds of chillies from around the world, and roast it there themselves. We had the - pozole, which was undeniably the best flavor I've had in a pozole (better than xoco by a large factor), with melt in your mouth pork- sweet potato fries - - a variety of baos - surprisingly, the tofu and shrimp, two proteins I didn't expect to bring out the strong flavors, held up admirably well versus the curry chicken- nutella biegnet - just perfect, not too much nutella, and literally out of the fryer, topped with sugar and on your tableThis is a lunch only place, with limited seating .The lines were out the door, but yet the staff made sure to strike up a conversation with most people sitting down. What a terrific experience! I almost didn't want to write this review, to let the joint keep it's ""hidden gem"" status, but were it not for Yelp,  I wouldn't not found this place myself. Cheers!"
"Everything on the menu is delicious, but I love the Saucy Porka bahn mi sandwich!"
The employees are so friendly and accommodating here and really welcoming. Great service and the food is great. I had the bao tacos - shrimp and short rib and both were great. Would definitely come back here very soon. Want to try all the other menu options. Highly recommend this place!
"Tried this place for the first time today after a coworker recommended it.I was really pleased with the food. Reasonable prices.I tried the Pork Carnitas Bacos, which were absolutely delicious. My only complaint is the paper they wrapped them in is really thin, and the bao stuck to it easily. When I unwrapped it the paper tore and it was a big mess.The pork ramen soup was really nice as well. The half order was huge. It has jalapeno in it so it has some heat, but it's topped with mint leaves so you get a nice cooling sensation as well. Very filling.And how do you not love a place that serves Mexican Coke?I'll definitely be back."
