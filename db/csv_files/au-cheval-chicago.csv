Au Cheval
"The wait was worth it!! I ordered the Cheeseburger and the crispy fries with the garlic aioli, fried egg, and béchamel sauce. About the Cheeseburger: Incredibly juicy, a soft and slightly sweet bun, and to top it off, its completed with a nice spread and the BEST thinly sliced pickles I've ever had! Them Crispy Fries: Ok. I'm no stranger to carbs and have had my fair share of fries and I must say, these were DELICIOUS. The fries were on the salty side, but it made the perfect complement for the cheesy béchamel sauce. If you're planning on ordering fries, you may as well upgrade to these since you've probably already waited over an hour just to sit downAll in all, this place is worth a visit and if you want to beat the crowd, just aim to eat around 9:30 on a weekday otherwise you'll most definitely be waiting around 2 hours +/-"
"Here I am. The famous Au Cheval. All those reviews about the burger and the long waits. They are partially true. As a burger connoisseur I had to go there and try it myself to see if the urban legends were true. Now here comes my hammer, behold!I went there by myself on a Tuesday night and waited 1.5hrs. There is a little trick to shorten your wait time, make your presence felt; meaning step in there every 30min and remind the guy that you are there and waiting. I was told that the wait would 3hrs. I actually saw people waited 3hrs, a group of 3.90% of the bars, grills and pubs serve their burgers with a side. Here, I had to order the fries separately. I kinda felt like it was a rip off; for such price, you should be able to provide burger with fries.Before I get to the burger, I will start with the ambient. The music was banging, literally banging. Even though the tables for 2 are small, people were yelling at each other to be heard. They do not play slow music and it is loud. I did not feel comfortable with that, maybe that's a business strategy to make people leave faster.The fries, the cut of the fries were good, I could feel the taste of the potato. The fries were served with garlic mayo which was another good thing. I myself eat my food salty but these fries were way too salty that dried my lips and burned my throat. Be easy on the salt guys. You may ruin nice fries and the burger experience.The legendary burger is not the best burger in the city; and definitely not the best in the country. For a restaurant/bar/pub burger, it was above average. Nice patty and good beef taste. There are at least couple of other burger places in the city makes it better. I do not understand the reason behind these exaggerated reviews. I guess when people wait 2 hours, it makes it more delicious and they are just conditioned to like it. Congratulations to the management or the PR team that created this hype, repute or marketing strategy for this place that makes people wait for hours for a normal atmosphere and food. If I could walk in and sit down yes, It was an ok experience but Definitely Not Worth the Wait, period."
"Does Au Cheval have a good burger? Yes. Is it the best burger that's worth the wait? No.If you don't want to listen to any reviews and plan on judging the burger for yourself for dinner, get here long before 5pm. Just because the KITCHEN is closed from 3pm-5pm doesn't mean that the RESTAURANT is closed then too. There are a ton of young kids hanging around drinking booze which makes me believe the drunkards give this place a 5 star without realizing what they are doing. Do not drink and review drunk please!Anyways back to the food. The burger is good, not great, nor is it the best burger. Are the patties juicy? Yes. Is there a proper bread to meat ratio? Yes. Is all of the above worth the wait? Hell no. The French fries are also good and the garlic aioli is fantastic. Hell, if a friend wants to go here again I'll probably get 3 orders of fries and skip the burger.If you're looking for a cool hipster bar with good food and don't care about paying too much for what you are getting, Au Cheval is your place."
"Look, if you hate waiting for anything, go elsewhere. But if you're willing and able to stop in at 11:00 for lunch on a weekday, get the burger and proceed to rave to your friends. It's not worth waiting 3 hours for (Kuma's Corner is my only will-wait-for-burger and that's a stretch), but it's delicious and worth a special trip out of the office.PS: you will smell like a diner afterward. They cook the burgers on an open griddle out front, and if you have long hair like me, you're gonna smell like Eau de Au Cheval allll day."
"Finally, a highly anticipated Chicago hot spot that didn't disappoint! (I'm looking at you Publican and Purple Pig) Au Cheval is known for its glorious cheeseburger and the long, looong wait, which is exactly what we got.Au Cheval is a tiny restaurant on the corner of Randolph street so not made for large parties. Our group of 6 was perfect, albeit a tad squeezed, for the booths in the venue. We came at 10pm on a Wednesday night hoping for maybe a 45 minute wait... Oh, boy were we wrong! Even at this quiet hour, the wait would be 2 hours. Disappointed but determined to bite into the legendary burger, we waited out at Haymerchant nearby.TIP: They will text you when your name comes up on the reservation list to which you will have ten minutes to respond. So, put your name on the list and get drinks somewhere nearby (or even go home) to pass the long wait time!When it was finally time, we ordered right away. Cheeseburgers with fried egg and bacon for everyone please! Please, everyone, do not ignore what all the fans say - this burger is out of this world. I will say, THE BEST burger I have ever had! Melt in your mouth, fatty goodness is what makes Au Cheval at the top of everyone's list. You have to get it with bacon and egg or you'd be doing it wrong. One friend also got the foi gras toast and another the duck hash. I am a sucker for foi gras and thought it was eclectic but sensational when paired with jelly. The duck hash was also a hit with my friend who doesn't eat beef. Foodgasms for the whole table!Can't wait to have this burger again and maybe sooner than I thought with the opening of Small Cheval!"
"I was recommended Au Cheval by one of my customers a long time ago and had to give it a try. I'm glad I did but doubt I'll make it a regular spot for a burger.Although the burger is quite good, it isn't amazing. I still prefer Umami Burger. I also had their French fries which were good but only when you dip them in the garlic aioli sauce.A bit weird that they open early but won't serve any food until 5 pm. The place is tiny so make sure you get there early if you want to eat."
"I finally tried Au Cheval's infamous cheeseburger - item #38 on my bucket list is now checked off. My friend took one for the team and put our names down early enough for us to eat at a reasonable time. Three hours later, we were seated at 9:30pm (yes, expect to wait that long). Here's a tip: get there as early as you can and put your name down. Then, either go home and do laundry, visit a friend you haven't seen in awhile, catch up on some Netflix, or grab several drinks somewhere and wait for your text to know that your seat is now available. Like Conor McGregor of the UFC, this is the real deal and not just talk. It's deceiving because the appearance and list of ingredients don't do it justice. You don't see a pile of fried onion rings or foie gras or whatever people are putting on burgers these days. It's literally just two patties with American cheese, pickles, and a mayo mixed with Dijon mustard - that's it but somehow it tastes amazing. The main flavor is fat but it's not greasy. The burger is cooked on a griddle where all of the meat juices go right back into the patty in comparison to an open grill. You bite into it and there's a burst of love juices that flow into your mouth and something magical happens afterwards. Whether it's laced with something or enchanted with David Blaine's evil demon magic, it is definitely an impressive burger that has left me puzzled.  I don't know how they do it but yes, it was a phenomenal burger."
"That is indeed a really good burger. Life-changing? No. But still a really good burger. Plan to arrive a few minutes before 11 and have everyone in your party with you - you can't be seated without everyone and you will lose your table.Burger was tasty, and make sure to get it with the delicious thick cut bacon. Possibly with an extra side of bacon. It's really good bacon. A surprising table favorite was the root beer on tap. With less carbonation than a typical bottle, I heard more cooing over this root beer than the burger itself. Fries came with good sauces, but were a bit limp for me.Dessert list is limited, but the mille feuille (pastry layers with cream) was excellent. Local black dog gelato (which is always tasty) is also available."
"I first visited Au Cheval two years ago with a friend who was obsessed and described this place as ""the most amazing place ever."" Two years, and three trips later, I still agree with him. I was here just last Friday. I arrived around 6:30pm and was told that the wait for a booth was 2.5-3 hours but I could be seated immediately at the counter. I didn't mind the counter at all because it meant I had a perfect view of the busy kitchen. For drinks, I ordered the Shakespeare Stout and loved it! Great stout beer! Every other time I've been here, I've ordered the bologna sandwich - which is delicious. But this time, I wanted to try the burger. For dinner, my friend and I both ordered single cheeseburgers with egg and bacon. It took about 15-20 minutes to get our food but the entire time we were amused by the fast pace of the kitchen.The burger arrived spread out and it looked amazing. We put the top half on the rest of the burger, pressed down, and watched the egg yolk ooze down the burger. Sometimes ooze is a gross thing but this was a delicious looking ooze. By the time the burger made it to my mouth, each bite was eggy, bacony, and meaty. It was perfection. I could've eaten the burger without pausing but I made sure I ate it slowly to savor the flavors. The single burger is actually two meat patties stacked but neither patty is exceptionally thick. It made for a filling but not truly heavy meal. Overall, this was a delicious experience. Burgers are definitely worth. Just be warned, adding the egg and bacon adds about another 5 bucks to the meal so dinner and drinks with tax and tip will cost you almost 30 bucks."
"Unless you've been living under a rock, you've certainly heard about Au Cheval's burger being one of the best in the country. I've been here numerous times, and can say that it lives up to the hype and is worth the wait. Don't think you're going to get in here with a party of eight people. Au Cheval is better suited to a group of four or less.If you don't want to wait 2-4 hours for a booth or table, just wait for the next open seat at the bar. It's first come, first serve. Plus, you get to see the kitchen in action. My wife commented on how it's like seeing harmony in motion. It's certainly captivating while you're waiting for your order. Everyone in the kitchen knows their role, there's no screaming like Hell's Kitchen, and things just get done. It's a beautiful thing.So how about that food? If you're going to order their famous burger, top it off with an egg and thick cut bacon. Trust me on this. Oh, if you're feeling especially gluttonous, just remember that a single is really a double and a double really is three patties. If you're going to top either of these off with bacon and egg, then you may have to be rolled out of the place. Fair warning!Next, try the crispy fries with an egg on top. It comes with sides of garlic aioli and mornay sauces. I love both, and it's a nice compliment to the burger. Plus you can share with your friends!Another item I've had is General Jane's Honey-Fried Chicken, and this is another fantastic dish to share with your table. It's sweet, and will certainly require a wet nap or two! It's a bit pricey, but if you think about the quantity and split it between friends, then you may be able to rationalize that dollar figure.All in all, I feel blessed to have a place like Au Cheval in Chicago that so many people around the country are raving about and flocking to while I just have to travel a relatively short distance. Folks, remember, the wait may be long, but there's the bar, and you can always just chill out at other places in the West Loop until you get that wonderful text saying a table is open for your party."
"Wow, I don't even like burgers and was not too excited to come here and have to wait hours to get one.  My bf and I had a friend come in from out of town and we wanted to take him somewhere good.  This place is like a modern classed up diner, dark, small, and very loud.  We came here on a Wednesday, around 5 pm and put in our names for a table for 3.  Our wait was almost two hours, but we went to a bar across the street while we were waiting for them to text us that they have a table available so it wasn't too bad.To start, I had their punch cocktail and it was really good! We ordered two sides of their fries with the egg on it and each got a single burger.  BE WARNED, the single has 2 patties, and the double has 3.  AND THE BURGER WAS AWESOME.  You absolutely have to get it with bacon and egg on it because it was literally all about the bacon, soooooo delicious.  And I loved the pickle/onion mayo they dress it with.  The burger was super juicy and melt in your mouth. I don't think I'll ever eat a burger again if it's not from here!  Everything ended up costing about $112 without tip, not bad."
"On a Saturday morning, the line wrapped around the corner and was about 90 people deep - 20 minutes before the restaurant even opened.I've had Au Cheval on my list of places to try for quite some time, and once my dad heard that Au Cheval had the ""best burger in Chicago,"" he insisted that we HAD to try it.  My dad thinks that paying more than $20 for a pair of shoes is ludicrous, so I warned him of the rumored long waits and gave caution of the burger with a hefty $11 pricetag - and that's before you add bacon or an egg.  He wavered a bit, but then became dead set on trying the burger that was declared ""best.""The good news is that, despite the long wait, they opened the doors and began seating promptly.  After that, the guy at the door began taking names and phone numbers.  We were quoted a wait for 1 hour, 15 minutes (I'd like to remind you that we arrived before they opened), and we headed across the street to Haymarket for some beers.The service is decent, the music is too loud to have a conversation, but who gives a sh*t?  When you waited in line this long you're starving and don't have time to speak.The burger is delicious; the single is two patties, the double is three.  The house made, brown sugar bacon is thick and practically a patty itself.  I didn't think the egg was necessary.  Worth the wait?  Well, I wouldn't do it again.  I still think that Leadbelly, Kuma's, and Flub a Dub Chub have superior burgers.  Au Cheval's is quite messy too; I dug in with my fork & knife.Get the fries.  The garlic aioli is a good dipping sauce for the burger too.Yes, the food is very good.  I loved that we were able to put in our name for a table instead of sweating bullets in line outside.  But I do think that, overall, Au Cheval is a bit over-hyped.  Their burger didn't break my top 3, but I wouldn't mind coming back to try something else on the menu."
"It's good. Very good. However, the wait is not. There's nothing fun about waiting 30-60 minutes for a cramped space. But, I doubt there's any way around it if you want to try this place. It has been on my list of places to try for quite some time but I could not bring myself to drive over to wait to eat a burger. But, my close friend insisted on having her birthday meal here so I made the exception and will say it was a great meal and I am glad I did. The wait has a lot to do with its size.  It's close quarters and the tables are seriously small. It's like staying in your first hotel in Paris. Uncomfortably tight but you are too excited about the whole experience to notice or care. We were seated in the back table area which is a long bench with several tiny tables spaced throughout with a chair on the opposite side of each table. When others are seated next to you, hold your food or pay attention.  I promise you. Something will shift on your table. Their coat, purse, butt or some other body part will touch something on your table because it's a little cramped. Is it worth trying? Definitely but personally, I would not visit here routinely. Primarily because I am not a fan of waiting thirty plus minutes to eat a burger in a city inundated with good burger joints. If you like sipping on Randolph street, you could be regular here. They will text you when your table is ready so you do not have to stand around waiting. FYI- the kitchen closes from 3p-5p each day."
"Voted one of the best burgers in America, be prepared for a ridiculous wait. // LOCATION // Across the street from Girl & the Goat // AMBIANCE // It is a itty bitty dimly lit bar // WAIT // 2 hours for a party of 2 on a weeknight during dinner. Insanity. Luckily they text you when your table is ready which gives you the opportunity to get drinks at the nearby bars// FOOD //      + Au Cheval burger: Topped with thick cut bacon and a perfectly cooked fried egg with an oozy yolk, this burger is fantastic. I don't know if anything is really worth waiting 2 hours for though."
"LIVED UP TO MY EXPECTATIONS. Best burger ever, hands down. Why you might ask? Well it's not just the meat itself (which is pretty darn juicy) but it's also all the extra stuff that goes with it. My husband and I bellied up to the bar for a couple burgers, fries, and beers. FYI I recommend just sitting at the bar- you get to watch all the action/magic happening. Plus we would get the occasional free samples of leftover things the cooks were making. Real cool people working there. The buns are perfectly toasted, the thick cut bacon covered in pepper, and maybe a bit of maple syrup, and the egg is cooked so perfectly so that when you smash it all together you get a the messiest most delicious burger imaginable. Be sure to include their sauce too! The fries were also perfection, and came with this ridiculous garlic dipping sauce. We had the apricot pale ale which I also recommend.Def a must on any burger lovers list!"
"So I always read the negative reviews when I go to a place as hyped as this to see if there's a legitimate beef (no pun intended, ok maybe a little intended) or if this is the usual brand of whiny yelper.  Here are the illegitimate beefs.Wah, I had to wait a really long time.  Uh duh.  That's what happens at good restaurants.  It's not a reason for a 1 star review.  Wah, the restaurant is small, therefore I had to wait a long time.  See above.Now let's move along.The burger.  Sheer perfection.  They don't ask you how you want it cooked because they know how to cook it so that it tastes better than anything you'll ever pull off your grill.  The combination of perfectly melted and creamy cheese along with one of the more tender burgers you'll ever devour was just heaven.  The bun was toasted just perfectly.  Just the slightest bit of crisp while not feeling heavy or like you were eating a piece of toasted garlic bread.  The bacon.  Allow me to close my eyes and smile for a moment in remembrance. The fries.  So yea $6bucks is a lot for some fries.  However having done my research I knew their were enough to share.  They were crispy, salty and delicious.  The burger is superior, but the fries were definitely worth having if you need fries with your burger.The drinks.  Yum.  I had an old fashioned and it was solid.  My friend had...hmm I don't remember, but it was orange in color and it was fabulous.  So ask for the orange thing on the cocktail menu. The wait, I dunno.  I'm not dumb enough to not read the reviews and just show up at dinner time on a Friday night.  I went on a Tuesday at 5pm sharp.  I waited zero minutes.  Chicago has a plethora of amazing burger joints and this one ranks near the very top."
"Came in on a Tuesday night at 10:45pm and had a 10 minutes wait. This alone speaks volumes about the popularity of the place.When we got seated the service was attentive and quick.Got a burger with egg and Moscow mule.The burger was spot on. Delicious, juicy, flavorful, and just overall a perfect cheat day meal (which I had right after working out. Oops)The atmosphere is old school diner and San Fran bar blended into one. I like it. It's fun yet relaxing. It's a bit dark though so prepare to use your phone to real the menu.I will most definitely come back for brunch with all the foie gras options and if I'm craving a simple yet delicious burger."
"""Au cheval"" means 'with egg' in French, our waiter stated matter of factly when we inquired as to whether the burgers came with an egg.  That explained a lot, to our collective relief, as the strict translation would refer to something about a horse.  And that's why we leave the culinary colloquialisms (and cooking) to the pros.  With that said, we decided to have an egg in everything we ordered, which wasn't hard to do:-au cheval cheese burger with THICK slabs of bacon-frites with garlic aioli and mornay sauce-scrambled eggs with foie grasSo first off, know that this is a HEAVY restaurant, even by Chicago standards.  We came here for brunch after a pretty massive dinner, and we had trouble finishing everything among the 3 of us.  That being said, if you had just come in from running a marathon or biking a century, this is THE meal to have.  The burger....oh the burger.  Best in America? Probably, but I'd love to taste the contenders that try to dethrone this badboy.  The foie gras scrambled eggs? Have a cardiologist handy (funnily, the 3rd person with us was actually a cardiologist).  We also topped it off with healthy helping of their bloody mary, made with sweet pickles (not a bad touch!).Overall, this is a great place.  But I think I could only come once every few months, unless I REALLY enjoyed the company of my cardiologist..."
"OMFG best burger ever. Seriously. You will rarely wait less than 1 to 2 hours to sit, but it's worth it. The burger is the juiciest thing you will ever taste. There's basically just one burger option: a cheeseburger. The patties are super thin so the regular cheeseburger has two patties, but you can also add on a third. I always get the regular cheeseburger with bacon. Mmm thick cut, delicious bacon. You can also get a runny egg on top...messy but delicious. And then there are the fries...fries fried in BUTTER. Butter!! They're the best. Seriously. I'm salivating just thinking about it. Put down your name when you're not hungry, go across the street to the brewery and then eat your heart out!"
"After hearing about this place for years, I finally was able to find a very random time to go and try the famous burger for myself.My mom and I stopped in on a cold, rainy, Thursday and were able to get seated right when it opened. I knew lines tended to get long, but I didn't realize that it was a combination of high demand and very limited seating. Definitely happy we got here right when it opened because by the time we left every seat was filled.As for the food - we ordered the fries to start and they were amazing. It was very hard to stop eating them, but we kept reminding ourselves that our burgers were coming and we'd need the room! I ordered the burger with egg and bacon, while she just ordered the egg. Be warned - these are big burgers and messy to eat. That being said, they were pretty amazing. I like when burgers are cooked thin and that's the way they do them here. It's definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had.However, I could never see myself waiting 3 hours to eat this burger. If you can help it, don't. Find a random time to take an early lunch, or show up late at night and hope the line isn't too bad. I think I was able to enjoy the food so much because I wasn't super angry that I'd been standing around for hours for a burger."
"First off, I wish Yelp had decimals... 4.5!!! The only thing is the wait which is totally understandable because this place is BUMPINNNNN. The decor- awesome, the service- great, the food- TOO GOOD. I got the hamburger with sunny side up egg and bacon... One of the best hamburgers I've had, HANDS DOWN. I kept telling myself that this burger better be the best burger on earth if I had to wait 2 hours in line for it, well it was worth it. They make their own pickles too so that was pretty bomb. Other dishes from the table- omelette with jack mushrooms and cheese and a duck heart skillet. Both were bomb! The duck heart was amazing, haven't had something like this since France! Would definitely go here again when I go back to Chicago and recommend to anyone visiting here!"
"Without a doubt the best burger spot in the country. Their bacon, egg and cheese burger is perfect in every way! I could eat this cheeseburger multiple times a week. No wonder Food Network had deemed Au Cheval's burger the best in the nation. Go a early or wait a long time. Either way, it's absolutely worth it. I wish I could eat here all the time."
"We met friends for Sunday brunch just before 10am and we joined the line of eagerly awaiting, hungry customers. Right at 10, the doors opened and the first seating filed inside.The restaurant has a cool and laid back vibe. With dark brown leather booths, wooden tables, and a large bar, it appeared more fitting for a night out for drinks than for a late morning meal. But, clearly this was a brunch haven for Chicagoans and tourists in the know. The brunch menu is limited with fairly standard entree options without any specific theme - burger, omelette, potato hash, salad, bologna sandwich, chilaquiles, simple egg breakfast, yogurt and granola. Sides included bacon, a blueberry muffin, fries or hash browns. More than half of the menu listed cocktails, breakfast beers, and coffee drinks.Nothing really stood out to me but yelpers seem to love the burger. While my friend cautioned me against buying into the hype, based on her experience with the burger there, I went against her recommendation and ordered it anyway. After all, Bon Appetit named it the ""Best in America"" in 2012.Two patties, cheese, and pickles were sandwiched between a toasted bun ($11.95), along with the add-on of thick-cut peppered bacon ($3.50) - which, by the way, was the star of the burger - and dijonnaise. I cut it in half and took a bite. It tasted like an ordinary burger. A good one, but nothing that couldn't be easily replicated. The order of fries ($5.95) were also just good. $20 for a mediocre bacon cheeseburger and fries, along with poor service, was a little ridiculous but the time spent with good company was priceless!"
"This place was recommended to us as being the best place to get a burger - it did not disappoint. The host told us it was a 2.5 hour wait, we waited. After only an hour, we got our table - we're unsure why the host told us 2.5 hours.  We already knew we wanted their signature cheese burger - we ordered it and waited with intense anticipation. When it came, we were floored. It looked so beautiful - I almost didn't want to cut into it (my fiancé and I split it). It was the most delicious cheeseburger I've ever had. I'd gladly wait 2.5 hours to order one of these bad boys."
"What to expect: Coming to this joint on a weekend means you're going to be on their wait-list. Don't worry, you can leave your name / phone number and you'll be free to leave. They'll text you when your next in line. Just be sure to arrive there 10 mins upon your text or you may lose your spot. I would give this 5/5 but waiting 4 hours that day from 6 p.m. was a disappointment. Usually the wait is 1~2 hours but 4 hours? Z.z~~Au Cheval, ""Home of the greatest burgers."" Many people often look past the fact that it may simply be A Burger. Well, if you haven't taken a bite of this gourmet burger, you really haven't tried a burger at all. This by far, will bring you back time and time again. For beginners, order their single cheeseburger with egg AND bacon. Why? Ordering a single cheeseburgers actually gives you two meat patties (you don't want to scarf down 4 patties if you ordered their double cheeseburger, or do you?) I'm going to say this again, please order the egg and bacon. If you don't, you won't find the excellent balance between the sweet-delicious bacon that is mixed with the egg yolk that neutralizes the salty beef patty. You'll thank me later. They have a wide selection of hard liquor and beer, so you'll be pleased to find both.As for parking, I'll let you in on a little secret. Right across Au Cheval on 740 W Randolph street there's parking available. A HIDDEN GEM. Or if you don't mind walking a mini bridge literally equivalent to 1 block its on 730 -732 W Randolph. There both paid meter parking. If you don't want to go back and forth checking on your meter. You can also download the parking meter app! Hope this helps."
Always busy per usual. Great atmosphere. Sitting at the bar is neat as you watch the crew toss out burgers left and right. Get there at least a half an hour before opening time on the weekends and you're bound to make it in on the first round of walk-ins.
"I have been to Au Cheval (and many other Brendan Sodikoff restaurants) a few times since I work nearby and is a great lunch spot when you want to eat early and beat the lines.  Au Cheval has the same decor and feel to Gilt Bar or Bavette's.  I'm sure you've heard of his famous cheeseburger (two patties) by now since it has been featured on every nationwide food publication/blog by now.  The hype is on another level with this place.  The burger is good and I have had the cheeseburger with bacon and egg on top and I have had it just simply prepared without the toppings, just bun, cheese and beef.  I would for sure recommend having it without the bacon since it is a thicker cut and completely overpowers the burger.  A fried egg normally makes everything better.  The General Jane's wings are good and crispy and completely drenched in sauce, but if you want good Asian fried chicken, head to Crisp in Lakeview.  I will also order the fried bologna sandwich when I'm not craving a burger and to be honest, it might be better than the famous cheeseburger.  It absolutely melts in your mouth.  The fries are very meh here.  I was expecting better.  Like I said, I have been here a few times and normally on the days after long weekday happy hours (that always turns into many happy hours) when I'm looking to eat something greasy at an earlier-than-normal lunch time since it is within walking distance to my office.  Come early and come hungry - you will be full the rest of the day.  I just wouldn't wait more than 30 mins to get a table when there are a lot of other great options nearby."
"This place is worth the hype, only 4 stars because while the food is amazing, I still feel weird getting an 80$ bill for burgers and beers. Here is a game plan for all first timers you should stick to:1. Get there at 4 pm, and save a table and grab some beers to wait to save your spot. They don't take reservations, and they don't start serving dinner until 5, but they will let you chill and hang out before then. By the time 5 pm rolled around, there was already a line out the door, and every table was full of people with the same idea.2. Split the sides like fries or whatever you want. They are huge, and one of the mistakes we made was each ordered a side of fries, when we could have easily split one. This probably added an extra 5 or 6 bucks to our bill.3. Get the fried egg and candied bacon on top. Yes it's more expensive, but you've already invested the time and effort to get to Au Cheval, so why on earth would you wait in line or wait at a table for an hour and NOT try the burger with all the trimmings?!Amazing burgers, great and friendly staff, love the ambiance of the rustic wooden tables and candles. Will go again when I have another Saturday afternoon free."
"Visiting Chicago to try a burger seems silly to most, but if you're prepared to try one of the finest gourmet burgers and mouthwatering bacon that Chicago has to offer then you're in for a real treat.My boyfriend and I visited Au Cheval on a brisk Friday afternoon and there was a swarm of people waiting outside. Our estimated time was roughly an hour, but luckily they took down cell number and called when our table was ready. When we got our call we headed into the intimate space and sat at the bar. I didn't notice at first, but they have hooks underneath to hang your coat and/or purses. The menu was a bit confusing as a single cheeseburger ($10.95) actually has two patties and a double ($12.95) has three, but we managed. We wanted to have a wide spread of items to sample so we decided to split a double cheeseburger, and ordered bacon a la carte (5 slices for $8.95), and fries with a fried egg and Monray sauce. I'd pass on the fancy fries with the egg (I felt that the egg didn't really bring much to the dish), but I highly recommend ordering the fries as is and you DEFINITELY need to order the bacon on the side - that way you can fully appreciate the bacon's amazing-ness. The bacon at Au Cheval is probably the best bacon I've ever had. The crispy exterior and juicy fatty interior was balanced with the sweet maple syrup taste and fresh cracked pepper. My gawd, it was heavenly and lets not forget about the burger which was also extremely flavorful. The bun was lightly toasted and the cheese melted perfected onto the juicy patty. Mmmm...  Overall, a very successful trip and while tourists may not think to come pay Au Cheval a visit, it certainly should be a destination for foodies worldwide."
"The burger here lives up to the hype. I've been many times and will keep coming back despite the crazy wait time. It's worth it. The key is going in with the right expectations. You have to come early, put your name down and then go for drinks or go home and take a nap or something. This is not the type of place were you show up 7pm on a Saturday, already hungry and try and get a table for your group of six. There are plenty of bar options in the area for a couple pre-dinner drinks. I'm also so impressed with the staff here. They are so lovely. They could probably be awful and people would still come, but they aren't.... the service is great. I haven't tried anything else on the menu, but the brunch menu does look great. If I went for brunch, I'd probably just get a burger again. It's one of the best burgers I've ever had, and definitely my favorite in Chicago."
"I've read the owner isn't big on Bon Appetit's declaration of Au Cheval having the ""Best Burger in the World"" (see link for Eater article) but I would like to say its one of the best burgers I've had and its not just because of the burger......it's also for the atmosphere and overall dining experience! Dimmed lights, closer seating arrangements and tunes that range from funk, synthetic pop, lounge and soul-hop make this diner feel like a modern day hub for ""hip"" in West Loop. If you're going to grab a seat, you should expect to wait for at least 30 mins but that's not necessarily a painful experience. Au Cheval has a pretty sound method to tackle the infamous ""waiting for a table"". Once they get your phone number, you're free to leave the restaurant until your table is ready, which is communicated by a series of personal text and not those awkward and at times confusing auto-generated messages - and that's something that's really appreciated!You're free to go an explore the West Loop until your meal is ready and there's quite a bit to see in the near couple block. Even if exploring isn't a thing for you, you can slide into a nearby restaurant or bar for a quick drink!Once you've received that text saying your table is ready, you'll walk into the hip atmosphere and have access to some of the best food and ""down to earth"" staff. If you can manage to sit at the bar - which highly recommend, you'll have a prime view of the chef-staff doing work on all of the orders. The staff can always make great recommendations but you should really go for the Cheeseburger if there's no dietary restrictions stopping you. The waiter / waitress will ask about food allergens and present the options for additional toppings (bacon or egg for the burger). Caution on ordering side items unless you're beyond hungry or splitting meals with someone as the cheeseburger itself will suffice. One note worthy item for the beer drinkers of the world - Last I checked, Au Cheval does serve Allagash Black which seems to be harder to find than Allagash White and with good reason - the flavor is far more of a milder spice that is very soothing and only adds to the hip atmosphere at Au Cheval!Resuming back to your meal - the food is usually served in a more than timely manner. Note that the burgers might get a bit messy but that's what keeps things interesting, right?All in all, Au Cheval offers a fairly simple menu with a delicious twist to almost every item on the menu in a hip environment. Does it have the best burger in the world - maybe, but it for sure offers one of the best dining experiences around a burger and that's a reason you should check it out!chicago.eater.com/2015/4…"
"Everyone is correct that they have REALLY good burgers. However, I don't think any food is worth waiting over 2.5 hours.. In any case.. I really liked how when you reserve your seat, they text you when your table is ready, so you have free reign to walk around the neighborhood, grab an appetizer and drink elsewhere while you wait.I have seen numerous comments on here regardless the rude staff and host? I thought everyone was super friendly, very accommodating and on top of their game. Wishful thinking, but hopefully once small cheval hits bucktown, I'll be able to enjoy another one of these burgers without the huge wait!"
"Really good. Not best burger in the country, good. Still it was a tasty double patty with really good bacon. Didn't go for the egg but we had that on the fries with melted gruyere. Also good drinks. The nice part is to combat the ridiculous wait times they let you give them your number so you can go get cheap great whiskey or beer across the street."
PLZ READ BEFORE COMING HERE: ok this is the most overrated restaurant in chicagoThe place is extremely small like literly like a little room. The wait is crazy 3 hours!???????! I sat at the bar and ate because i aint waiting 3 hours. The service i hatted it they were either to busy talking with their coworkers or drinking not being helpful or nice i would never come here again even if it was for free foods okay best burger in chicago good joke!! Best burgers kumas corners wish i went to girl and the goat right next door!!!!! Bloody marry: it was horrible i was at the bar so i saw how he made it it was already premade so it was extremely old like it had a funky taste to it being that it was very old the fixings were horrible there just vegetables? Some were good though because it was a sweet pickling but just was the worst cocktail ive ever had in my life Bone marrow- this was the best thing here it was soo rich like omg so great then the bread is to die for supper toasty and buttery the marmalade was great! Such a great pairing the only problem was its to rich needs acid to cut the richness or a salad because its way to heavyfries with mornay sauce- the fries were really crispy but they needed salt and seasioning because they were bland the marnay sauce sucked it lacked good cheeze flavor it was jus okay didnt do anything the aioli was good but i had better aioli at tons of places. The egg didnt see a purpose to it really it wasnt seasoned just had chives on itThe burger- the pattys are really thin didnt really have any flavour to them. The bun was falling apart. The condiments didnt add anything to it. The bacon was really good but it was really chewy so hard to eat lardons would be better all in all nothing special about it jus a normal burger u can get a cheaper better bigger burger at kumas cornerAll in all i wish i didnt come here biggiest disappoint saw it on check please so thats why i came this is a hipster spot for sure but not worth it at all to expensive wish i would have went to girl and the goat right next door
"The reviews complaining about the wait time are hilarious.  These are the same people that expect to roll up to Girl & the Goat at 6pm on a Saturday and be seated immediately.  Not going to happen.   They don't take reservations because they don't need to.  Want to plan your evening? Go somewhere else.So if you want to eat at Au Cheval without a three hour wait, you have to be smart about it.  When we go, one of us gets there real early (think 4:15ish) to get our name on the list.  The wait it usually about an hour at that point. Then you can go grab a beer at Lone Wolf (or do what we did, go sit and watch the dogs at the dog park at Adams & Peoria), and before you know it you're getting that text asking for your ETA 'cause your seat is ready!The people committed to standing around inside or outside are just dumb.  Go occupy yourself while you wait.The food here is outstanding, and while I haven't had enough burgers to know if its the best in the US, it's damn good.  Drinks are solid too, and if you aren't wanting to pay $12 for an old fashioned you can always get a $3 tallboy of Hamms (yes, Hamms)."
"I get it now. This place is something else and not just for their other-worldly burgers. I've been frequenting Randolph Street quite a bit this summer. Eating at Au Cheval almost felt like an obligation. I mean, I'm a lifetime Chicagoan, right? I've gotta eat this overly touted burger at least once, right?   Most of the times we would pass by and ask the wait time just for fun. Three hours you say? Hmmm...maybe next time. Well, that next time finally came. We had a plan. Put our name down right as the place reopens for dinner. Well, in true fashion, our plan kinda failed. We didn't know bar stayed open from 3-5pm, and that people would be putting their name down on the list before dinner service started. At 4:30 we stood in line to talk to the host, or as I like to call him, the guardian of the burger gates.    We ended up with a 2.5hr wait. Ok, that's doable. We walked around Randolph Street and actually ate and drank at a few other places because we are true foodies. Even had a doughnut. Good news was that the wait was only a bit over 1.5hrs. Sitting down felt soooo good. The ambience is so understatedly cool. It's like eating in a hallway, but in the hallway of the backstage to a rock concert. We ordered some drinks to start. I had the Hemingway Daiquiri. Best. Drink. Of my life. Of course both of us ordered the double burger (3 patties) with bacon and an egg. We split the fries with aioli sauce.    The burger was of course amazing. Best burger of my life? Not sure. Definitely top 3. I was amazed they cooked those thin patties to medium. The melty gooey Kraft cheese works so well. Best. Bacon. Of my life. The fries were delicious. Service was great.   We did it. We conquered Au Cheval and the famed burger. 3 days later we conquered it again. No joke. That time we stopped in later  around 10:30pm and after 15min was able to grab a seat at the bar and eat. Score. Once I get out of my burger coma, I'll probably come back for the chicken and bone marrow. And dat bacon and daiquiri."
"Looking for the best burger in Chicago...nay America? Then this is the place to go and Food Network agrees! All I can say is OMG. No matter how many times I visit this place, it does not disappoint. Most burger places tout the best burger because of the creative toppings. However, what people fail to realize is that if you get the basics right, the burger will be amazing. The patties here are seasoned perfectly and topped with just the right amount of cheese. If you choose, you can add a delicious and thick slab (yes slab) of pepper bacon. Also addicting are their fries with garlic aioli. If you add a fried egg to the fries, it takes them to a whole other level of deliciousness.The key piece of advice I would offer is don't go when you actually want to eat because they don't take reservations and the wait can range from 1 to 4 hours. I would recommend putting your name in a couple hours before you are actually ready to eat and grab a drink around the area. Also, this place is small so if you have parties more than 5 people,  be prepared to sit separately. Either way,  it is soooooooooo worth it."
"When I Chicago I got a ton of recommendations to try this place out - and the burger definitely did not disappoint. I was quoted a 45 minute wait (they take your number so you can wander and be texted when your table is ready) but got seated in 30. The burger was just as amazing as you've heard, the service unfortunately was not awesome. They forgot the egg on my burger (a must) and instead of taking it back to add it or remake, they had me wait and brought one out separately 5 minutes later. A bit of a bummer but the fact that the burger was out of this world good more than made up for it. Except to leave in a food coma. :)"
"Went in the evening and the wait time was over an hour long for a party of two. FYI: Larger parties are hard to seat here. We roamed around Randolph street exploring as this restaurant has a texting waiting list ensuring that no one gets skipped as they send a notification when your table is ready. With that said, we most certainly were skipped and upon returning and checking in with the frazzled host, I took a peek at the hardcopy paper and noticed other parties of two were seated before us... not cool.Regardless, we were finally seated in a comfy booth and determined the food was worth the wait. We ordered what our friends hyped up: thick bacon-sunnysideupegg-cheeseburger, fries and off the menu mille-feuille Napoleon dessert.Read an article saying that Au Cheval is ranked #2 best gourmet burger in the U.S. Needless to say, we recommend this restaurant as we went back for more delicious food!The second time we decided to go, we went for lunch during a week day. Zero wait time!On a different note, there's one bathroom for girls and one for boys.... small restaurant with no waiting area except outdoors, open kitchen with bar stools, dim lighting for ambiance, Chicago pay-to-park spots unless you're super lucky and get a freebie spot a couple blocks down."
"I came here for lunch, and quite enjoyed the small venue with a very unique blend of classic settings and hipster music. Food is good: I had that burger with eggs (optional), which I was completely satisfied with. I sat on the bar and watched the cooks making food with rhythm, as the music was playing in the background - quite enjoyable to observe while waiting on your food.I can understand why it would be hard to get a seat at other time than late lunch or late night, since it's such a small restaurant. But if you have a chance, definitely try out one of their burgers, it's worth it."
"A MILLION STARS plain and simple. Au Cheval has been around for quite some time and the fact you will still wait up to 3 hours on a weekend night speaks volumes to its amazingness! There's just too many words to be said about this masterpiece. First and foremost...KILLER food. It's unreal. Save yourself any trouble and order the burger. There is nothing else that comes close to this burger in all of Chicago. Secondly, TRENDY. Yes you will wait, and yes it's worth it. It's situated on the most popular street so there is no shortage of places to go have a couple of drinks while you wait. I'm keeping this review short to add to the allure of Au Cheval...basically it's the see and be seen in Chicago. Don't miss it! ;)"
"I have been here on various occasions and each time the wait is dreadful, but once you sink your teeth in that burger, you would be thankful you were patient.My recommendation is go during brunch which is 11am-3pm on Saturday and opens an hour earlier on Sundays. Why brunch you ask? Because they serve their infamous burger and you can get an order of their awesome bacon but without such a crazy wait time. I find it that you get more bang for your buck if you order the bacon as a dish versus on your burger because 1. You get more pieces and 2. Who doesn't want more bacon? Drop a couple of that goodness on your burger and proceed to devour. What I like about the bacon is the pepperiness is subtle and the melt in your mouth texture leaves you with pure bliss with each bite. Besides the bacon, you can take your burger even further by adding an egg. Beware, it can get a little messy, but you don't want to be that person in the restaurant looking over at the other table regretting you didn't get the egg too. Trust me.To pair my burger during brunch, instead of a side of fries, I got a side of hash brown. You get your starch, but breakfast style instead. I figured you can mix it up, but do as your stomach desires. On the side note, if you ever go for lunch/dinner and you like bone marrow, then its a no brainer. Order asap!"
"Hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had. The burger itself was perfectly seasoned while the egg and thick cut bacon pulled it all together perfectly. (Tip: remember to ask to add the bacon and egg, they won't ask you if you want it)Also THE FRIES!! Amazing. I recommend splitting them with one person because a lot of them come in one order and with a size of a delicious garlic aioli sauce. Although they told us it would be a 2.5 hour wait for dinner on a Thursday, we ended up only waiting one hour. They text you when the tables ready so you're able to leave and grab a drink at one of the bars nearby while you wait. Highly recommend!!"
"Au Cheval's burger lived up to the hype! It was simply delicious. Seasoned well and cooked to a medium in temperature this burger is immediately in my top five of all time! The bun was so soft and tasty but firm enough to handle the over easy egg, bacon, cheese & burger. The bacon was a treat on its own. That had to be the best slice of American cheese in the WORLD! Lol"
"Be prepared to wait when you come here. There is an average wait time of 2 1/2 hours. The kitchen closes at 3 PM to 5 PM. The bar remains open during these hours. We stayed and had a couple drinks and just waited for the kitchen to reopen. We started with the bone marrow and beef marmalade. It was really good but needed a tad more salt on the bone marrow. The beef marmalade was the best part of the whole thing. These burgers are very rich. The bacon is not like your average bacon on a burger, it's an actual slab of thick bacon. The single patty was just enough for me because of the bacon. I got the fries with gravy and an egg on top, it was good, I didn't find it special. The bloody Mary was very tasty. One of the best I've had. This place is pretty pricey. I spent about $120 for burgers and drinks. The bone marrow runs about $20. By the end of the meal I couldn't walk anymore. I had to take a bus back down to my hotel. Overall, great but if I didn't wait at the bar while the kitchen was closed I would have never waited the 2 to 3 hour wait. Super heavy food. If you're on a diet, don't bother coming here. They also play awesome music."
"Known for the best burger in America and let me tell you, it was!My boyfriend and I got there on a Saturday night around 10:40. We were told the wait was going to be 45-60 min and will get a text, while wasting time, by around 11:20, we didn't get a text but decided to go back in anyways. We ended up getting seated. I got a single cheeseburger with a fried egg and it was delicious! We also got a side of fries with an egg on top, even better! It was definitely worth the wait and I would go back!"
"I came here having high hopes because everyone hyped this place up so much but like overhyped places, it didn't reach my expectations. I felt like the food was pretty average. I had the burger that everyone said you MUST try and it was just really basic. I thought it would have been tastier. I mean don't get me wrong it was pretty juicy. Who wouldn't like a juicy burger right? But like I said, it was so simple. We also had the bone marrow which was more satisfying in taste so I do recommend people getting that. This place seem to ALWAYS be busy. We came around 1 PM & there was already a line. I personally wouldn't wait over an out for this joint."
"Well, after waiting an hour and a half for a table on a Monday night, I really had high hopes for the food I was about to receive & I was not disappointed!I started with the Hemingway daiquiri which was pretty tasty. Not too sweet, not too sour. It really had the perfect flavor. For our appetizer, we had the chopped chicken liver with salted butter & toast. Uh, what the hell?! This was so delicious, you could have just eaten the butter by itself. Definitely a must try! Seriously, I am craving it just thinking about it. I really had a few ideas in mind for dinner but my husband said the cheeseburger was the way to go... so I had the single cheeseburger (which is actually a double) with peppered bacon and egg. Um.. Yes! Absolutely fantastic! Perfectly cooked and incredible flavor. The hubs had the fried house made bologna sandwich & of course I had to take a bite or two. It was a very good bologna sandwich, but slightly too garlicy (& I love me some garlic) for my taste. My husband loved it though & because it was his meal that's all that matters. I seriously cannot wait to go back!!"
"Au cheval serves one of the best burgers in Chicago, hands down. My friend, who is a foodie based in Chicago suggested that if there's a place to check out for burger, Au Cheval is THE place to be. True enough, the burger here changed my life, literally. I was here on a Saturday night and it was very pack. Lucky me, I was alone and could grab any of those 6 free seating at the bar. That being said, I did wait for almost 2 hours before I could sit down and eat. If you come with a party of 2 onwards and without any reservation, be prepared to wait at least 3 - 4 hours and the hostess would suggest you to go to the bar nearby, grab a drink and they'll call when the table is ready.  It's that crazy. I ordered the open sandwich burger - their signature burger with fried egg and bacon. The beef patty was really good - juicy and flavorful and the bun that hold the patty was not soggy at all. I am very particular when it comes to burger and the bun has to be crispy and not soggy and soaked in butter / oil.  On top of the beef patty sat 3 huge pieces of bacon that were slightly seasoned with black pepper. I mingled around and got to know most of the people are regulars to Au Cheval and some are locals that had heard about the place through word of mouth from their friends or colleagues. One couple was kind enough to buy me a drink while we chat how we got to know about this place and where we come from.Besides burger, I had thick cut fries and root beer to complete the meal. The root beer is another signature drink that you have to try served in an old school mug. If im back in Chicago again, I would definitely come back again even though there could be other burger joint in the city that could rival them. A solid 5 star for this place. p/s: It could be slightly far to walk from the city and it's bloody cold at night, so grab a cab. It's just a short 5-10 mins ride.  In total, I paid $28 for a burger, fries and a root beer. I had another free cider all thanks to the kind couple!"
"I had been meaning to go here for a while with my friends so when we finally went, of course the wait was three hours.  We decided to go for it.  Why not, really?  We sat at Three Floyd's next door and ate a minimal amount of food there and drank beer, saving our stomachs for the burgers.After three and a half hours, having not been texted saying our table was ready, we went in to ask about our table and it turned out they'd written down my friend's number incorrectly!  We almost lost our table!  Thankfully, they seated us right away.  It is SO dark in there in the evenings.  I guess that adds to the aura?  I couldn't see my food very well.We got fries, smashed potatoes, and, of course, BURGERS.-The fries were probably my favorite part, honestly.  Perfectly crispy and greasy and salted, served the fun way (in a paper cone!), and accented with a side of special sauce/ aioli/ the greatest sauce on the planet.  I asked for two extra sides of it.  That was almost enough to satisfy me.  Also, we initially ordered four orders of fries (one for each of us) but our waiter suggested we drop down to two, saying that was a lot.  I honestly just have a lot of respect for any server who doesn't prioritize making the bill as large as possible and actually helps to inform the customers of what would be an ideal serving size/ order amount.  -Smashed potatoes with garlic gravy - why are these called smashed potatoes?  They're mashed potatoes.  Believe it or not, there's a big difference.  Still, they were delicious - buttery, creamy, and the flavor of the gravy was spot on. -Single burger - ...do I really need to say anything about this?  The burger was delicious, the egg and bacon on top were GREAT (the bacon is so thick and perfect!!).  My only complaint was that it fell apart (makes sense for a huge, soggy burger) and the restaurant was so dark, I had trouble finding the fallout on my plate.  Unsure my stomach can ever handle eating here again, but the whole experience, including the wait, was uniquely Chicago and a lot of fun.  I'd recommend going at least once :)."
The single cheeseburger (really a double) is in my top 3 favorite burgers of all time.  Cannot wait to come backSide tip:  wait times for tables are super long... so try for a seat at the bar
"Two words: BURGER PORN. Such ooey, gooey drippy madness. Got there 25 minutes before they opened and had to wait another 45 minutes no big deal. Absolutely stunning burger. Those fries, tho. That garlic aoli! Heaven!"
"Came here at 11pm on a Tuesday; it was a couple minutes wait for a seat at the counter. I had the cheeseburger with bacon, though I wish I had gotten the fried egg on top too (next time!). It was very delicious, greasy, good. I've heard about the lines and glad I didn't go during regular dinner hours--it's a small place. I'll go back."
"Better experience second time around. Came here on Tuesday around 630pm and had an hour to hour 30 wait. We figured this would happen so we walked over to Lone Wolf for beers outside.We got paged within the hour and showed up five minutes later but had to wait another 20 minutes outside the restaurant. It was a nice night out so not too bad.Once seated, we felt the hustle inside. Our server was nice and worked fast. We got the chicken liver app and then I had a single (which is actually a double!!!) and my fiancé got a double (which is actually a TRIPLE). All the food was good. We were stuffed and needed the walk home.I still believe they should take some reservations just to accommodate customers and make it easier for us to plan our evenings. They don't need to given turnover is nonstop but it would be nice for us!"
"A potential three hour wait for a $22 adult version of a Big Mac meal (overdone Sysco patties with Kraft cheese on a highly-processed sponge bun.)Here's how they keep up the hype:1. Downplayed actual wait time. You will get an estimated wait time of roughly 2 hours+. At that time, you will wait more.  After that, they will text you, at which point you have 10 minutes to check-in or forfeit your hard-earned spot.  Upon check-in you will be told that your table is almost ready, so you will wait more time before actually sitting.  This is not including the standard wait time for your server and the actual food. 2. Snooty add-ons that offset the shoddy quality of the actual burger.  $3.50 for sugar-coated thick bacon add-on. $9 foie gras.3. Faux cool-kid environment. Loud music. Small reclaimed interior. Punkish staff."
Crazy good burger!   Can't wait to go back.Went for link and the wait was not a bad as we expected.  We all got burgers and everyone loved them.
"Went back for dinner and again left feeling like I was in food euphoria. My friends and I once again got the crispy fries w/ mornay sauce and bone marrow, and once again we were not let down. New additions to our dining experience included:-Chopped chicken liver, salted butter, and toast: this was pure heaven. The liver was delicious and had nice big chunks (think a rough ground beef). I am definitely ordering this again every time I come back to Au Cheval-Double cheeseburger w/ fried egg and thick cut peppered bacon: I made the fatal mistake of not ordering this my 1st time here (and instead trying bites of my friend's), and I would not make that mistake again. As stated in my previous review, this burger is life-changing. Bread: perfect. Patties: awesome. Bacon: thick. Egg: beautiful. Overall: AH-MAY-ZING. I like to think I have a pretty big appetite and can finish most dishes, but this double cheeseburger was definitely a struggle to eat. I'd say go for the single cheeseburger (if you're getting it w/ bacon and the egg) and that will leave you feeling full; the double cheeseburger (again, w/ bacon and the egg) will leave you feeling STUFFED (but in a good, lemme-unbutton-my-pants-I'm-so-happy way, not a gross way). Either way, MAKE SURE YOU GET THE BURGER (preferably w/ bacon and the fried egg)The servers here know their beer. I had the saisonnière last time per our server's recommendation, and that was great. Tonight, I was in the mood for an IPA and our server recommended the heyoka ipa, which was on point.I told myself that while I'm in Chicago, I'm only going to eat at each food establishment once (so that I can experience as many restaurants as possible), but amazing food places like Au Cheval are making that impossible. I'm not complaining, though - keep up the awesomeness, Au Cheval!"
"Sorry to disappoint, but we were totally underwhelmed by their burgers...Service was so-so. Seems they were mostly pushing alcoholic beverages (maybe if we had ceded to their entreaties, the burgers might have tasted better?).Not much else to say about the place --- sorry for low rating, but description per Yelp is ""Meh. I've experienced better"", which is very much how we felt.Not judging on much else than burgers (I can't even remember much about fries), but that was the hyped food there so didn't feel we had to explore more.For comparison purposes, on the same street we much prefer Grange Hall's burgers (still not in our top list though)."
"Au Cheval was admittedly the most impromptu visit during our trip to Chicago, a serendipitous discovery brought about by a less-than-satisfactory meal at Girl & The Goat. Thankfully, Au Cheval was right across the street and thanks to the late hour, we were quickly greeted and seated at a booth.This diner/bar is already considered a city institution, despite the fact that it opened relatively recently in 2012. Its name, taken literally, translates to ""on horseback"" in French; at least as it relates to food, it indicates that there's an accompanying fried egg to a dish.There's nothing pretentious about Au Cheval, except for, perhaps, the inevitable lengthy waits to get in during prime dinner and drinking hours. There's a row of counter seats where guests can grab a drink and watch the staff cook up an array of dishes, a few two-tops, and a handful of spacious booth seats against the wall. It's not the place to bring someone to in an attempt to impress [1], but it makes it the perfect place to visit when all you need is some good food, a drink, or both. Late at night, it borders on dive bar-esque, with dim lighting and blaring music.Although I'd insisted on ordering just one plate to share, considering that it was our second dinner, we ended up going with two. First to arrive was the Crispy Potato Hash with Duck Heart Gravy, a hearty portion of crisp-crunchy shredded potatoes with a thick onion-based gravy, topped with a perfect fried egg and a sprinkling of chives. It's an impressive starting plate, best when shared amongst a group of people, as the combination of ingredients gets pretty heavy several bites in. The gravy wasn't too overwhelming, with a faint metallic tang that added a notable richness to the gravy.Of course, we had to try one of Au Cheval's signature burgers as well, and the Single Cheeseburger (which is actually served with two patties, despite what its name entails) was yet another success, consisting of a four ounce prime(!) blend cooked to a medium, sandwiched between a soft bun and a layer of pickels, onions, dijonnaise, and a melted slice of cheese. Just like the venue, the burger is simple, no-frills, but expertly done, hitting all the right notes, especially with the addition of a runny fried egg. What more do I need to say? A low-key environment, tasty food that's perfect after a night of drinking, and a more than reasonable price point has to be a win in any book. Come earlier or later in the evening to avoid the lines, if possible, but regardless, Au Cheval is certainly worth the wait.--[1] Unless, of course, your partner's priorities are clearly in line."
My favorite restaurant in Chicago. Hands down. Every bit is amazing. This is the place of my dreams...And they have more on the menu that is phenomenal than just the burger. I promise.
"I'd heard about the 2-hour (or more) waits in the evening, so I showed up a bit after opening -- and still had to wait like 45 minutes. It's a very unpretentious setting, and the menu and servers are similarly, pleasantly, unpretentious.The first food section on the menu had fried chicken, and it sounded delicious -- which I mentioned sort of in passing, as a joke, because obviously we weren't there for fried chicken. But my friend liked the thought, and we decided to split that and a burger -- good move it was. Our fried chicken was the envy of the restaurant (or at least a few people seated near us who saw it). It was also maybe 6 pieces, and honestly would have been enough food. The sauce is excellent, and the frying alone would have been enough -- it was expertly done, and of a nice consistency. We also got a double cheese burger, which apparently means double cheese and actually 3 burger patties. The burger patties are thin, which was interesting in the day of the thick, meaty burger. They let us get an egg on the side. The bacon is of the thick, really hammy, not crispy variety. The smashed potatoes weren't what I've come to think of as smashed potatoes, and were actually mashed potatoes -- and were delicious, with gravy and a clove of garlic floating in the middle of the gravy.The beer selection wasn't huge, at least on tap, but they had some nice choices in a variety of styles.The food came quickly, but we didn't feel rushed at all, despite the fact that I'm sure there was a wait. They were very attentive about clearing dishes and refilling water.There's bike parking outside, but you may have to look around a bit because it all seems to be full when I've been in the area."
"We took advantage of our Chicago Staycation and went to Au Cheval on a summer Monday, at around 1:30pm. Worth mentioning, it was 2 days after they were named Best Burger in the country. Figured that would be about the shortest wait time we could get! The host told us it would be around an hour and a half for a table (not bar stools) for 2. Luckily one of us lives just across the highway from the restaurant so we went back there to relax. They told us they would text us when our table was almost ready. About an hour later, we got a text saying our table was ready and we let them know we would be there in 5-10 minutes. Hint: They really like you responding with a Yes/No you are coming and ETA.  As soon as we walked in, we were seated. We ordered iced tea and coke, and perused the menu. We ordered the double cheeseburger (added bacon) and the bratwurst with plans to split both. The food was truly phenomenal. The burger was about as good as it gets. Perfect combination of flavors and complexity while being an all around solid burger. The bratwurst melted in your mouth and was perfect with the garlic mashed potatoes and gravy. I've been having dreams about this meal. Total was around $50 (no alcohol). If you go, plan to wait, but it's worth it. Try off peak times like mid-week late lunch."
"I really like this place.  Yeah, the wait can be long, but if you go at the right time, it's not too bad.  I've been a few times.  The first time, we just sat at the bar, asked for cocktail recommendations based on what we usually like, and the bartender blew us away with some fantastic bourbon cocktails.  Then, I even refined what I liked, asking for something even less sweet.  I was then served the best cocktail I've had in my life.  I hate the word ""mixologist,"" but dang, these folks were professional mixologists and likely some of the best out there.Another time I went for dinner with my parents.  We were seated quickly.  We ordered some things to share and the food was fantastic.  We were even more impressed when the house red wine was so affordable, which kept the price of our entire dinner down.I now live in San Diego, and every time a friend from here goes to Chicago for a visit, I recommend Au Cheval for a bit of that fantastic Chicago food done really well without all the fuss of one of the bigger names."
"We have been both before and after all of the hype. The burger is solid, but nothing Im consistently craving. Definitely a great quality burger option, but there are many, many burgers I would preference over this one. And not a chance I will ever wait for three hours again for this; it's just not worth all of that. I'm excited for Small Cheval to open in Wicker Park to see what that's all about!"
"I came to Au Cheval because I heard about their awesome burger. So that is exactly what I ordered. The burger came quickly. I added egg and bacon to my burger which made it more expensive. The burger meat was very quality and you could tell that it was not frozen. Very fresh! The egg complemented the burger well. I did not enjoy the bacon as much. It was thick cut bacon. I thought that it added unnecessary grease to the burger and I will not add bacon next time. The servers were really helpful and kind. This is a popular place so make sure you get their early! If I am ever in the area again, I will definitely pay Au Cheval a visit!"
"Best burger of my life.They don't take reservations and you should expect to wait hours, especially during peak times. Protip: go before you're actually hungry, put your name in and explore the area before dinner. They'll text you when your table is ready. The burger is actually a double, the double is actually a triple - try it with the egg, bacon, and truffle fries. The matzah ball soup is also yum!"
"You know a place will be good if they have a separate ""with eggs"" section on their menu. Expect a wait anytime after 4pm. If you're wanting to get a taste of what has been deemed Chicago's best burger, then it's probably worth the wait. Unfortunately, the burgers (oddly put under ""sandwiches"" on their menu) here do not come with fries. Which means, you must order them as a starter and with a fried farm egg. Crispy, well-seasoned, and pipin' hot! Along with the fries, I suggest wetting the pallet with general jane's (who dat?) crispy honey-fried chicken. Sweet, tangy, and quite tender. In addition to the confusion caused by being under ""sandwiches"" on their menu, the cheeseburgers are double what the name suggests: ""single"" means double patties, and ""double"" means quadruple patties. I suggest the former, for both your arteries sake as well as a balanced meat-to-bread ratio. The cheeseburger meat is cooked quite perfectly to a medium-rare, and not over-mashed, which has a meaty consistency in texture. Well-seasoned and tasty, yet very simple. The simplicity allows the burger to bring out it's basic and main ingredients in a very clear way so that you appreciate all that is has to offer. As if that wasn't eggcellent enough, the fried and runny egg surely finishes the burger quite well. Overall, great burgers, worth the wait only if you're a burger enthusiast and feel like you must try for yourself what the hype is about."
"I never thought I'd use the words ""velvety"" or ""creamy"" to describe a cheeseburger, but here I am trying to write a review and all I can think about is how perfect and almost soft this cheeseburger felt in my mouth. Cheeseburger mouth feel is apparently a thing I care about now.Mad respect for a place that knows their burger is so good and their ground beef is so trustworthy that they don't have to ask you how you want it cooked because they know it's best when they serve it medium well.French fries cooked in pork fat. I'll never go back to non-pork fat fries ever again.Pretty good selection of beers. Weirdly overpriced selection of liquors, including a rye whiskey that's considered well whiskey in Austin but is apparently worth $9 a serving in Chicago.Expect to wait. We went on a Saturday, got there by 11, and were told it was an hour and a half wait for a table. Lucky for us, we'd already purchased admission to Randolph Street Market (15 minute walk down Randolph St. if you're a fast walker) so we had no problem filling the time, but there seem to be only other restaurants in the area so I don't know what we would've done if we hadn't had the market to go to."
"Let's get this out of the way, early, it's the best damn burger I've ever had, anywhere. Yes, anywhere. Get it with the fried egg and bacon. The old fashioned is solid and not insanely priced. Good beer selection. The fries, as many have said, are, awesome. The aioli is really something else. So why 3 stars, only? Because, everything else sucks. The place only seats roughly 50 people. It's a small bar area. The hostesses are downright mean. There's no other way to describe it. You constantly feel like you're just doing the wrong thing. ""sir, you can't stand there. sir, you can't sit there. sir, you can't..."" The people working there are simply jerks. Get over yourself. Your a pseudo diner, catering to a hipster crowd. Tilt your nose down already. If they didn't have that burger, this place would rate 3 stars and below for everyone."
"Don't let anyone tell you this burger isn't worth the wait, WOW! I would eat it every week.I highly recommend being there at EXACTLY 4:40 to ensure you don't have to wait or coming at about 11PM because otherwise you will have at least a 2 hour wait and be drinking across the street at Haymarket. Order the burger with the egg, bacon and cheese as recommended and get some fries. You will never forget it and be back for more soon."
"Get there early. This place will be packed. However, it's hands down worth the wait. I've had burgers all over and by far this is now my favorite. Food Network wasn't kidding when they claimed it as the best burger in America. It's delicious, mouth watering, juicy, flavorful, and extremely filling. You could get the single (ahem, double) or double (er, triple) burger and be set--but you'd be missing out on their delicious fries with garlic aioli. GET THE BURGER WITH BACON AND A FRIED EGG ON TOP. If you don't, well then that's just silly of you. You're missing out on the full experience.Everything was tremendous. I was in Chicago for a 5 day trip and had to convince myself not to go back for a second time as it would be unfair to the rest of the food in Chicago. It was a struggle, and I still wish I went back. I'm going to book a one day flight right now just to go back again."
"Cozy, trendy diner. My bf and I ordered the fries served with mornay sauce, garlic aioli and a fried egg to share. They were delicious! I would highly recommend those fries. I ordered the omelette du jour which was very rich and flavorful. I couldn't finish the entire thing because it was so rich. The oyster mushrooms in my omelette were amazing. My bf ordered a bacon burger and he seemed to enjoy it. I would have given Au Cheval 5 out of 5 but their music was so loud and distracting. I wasn't expecting that. Also, the sound system was rattling and the music didn't even sound clear."
"Headed over to the West Loop on a Saturday night with a strict plan to eat at Au Cheval, no matter the wait. Quite daunting to walk in there on a Saturday and see JUST how small the restaurant is. We were quoted 2 and a half hours and headed next door to Lone Wolf to have a few drinks. Fortunately, I received a text an hour and a half after we had put our name in to say a table would be ready in a few minutes. We were seated right at the edge of the bar, which is not a very desirable location, but we weren't in the mood to wait any longer. Sitting at the bar, as it turns out, is pretty awesome. Watching the process of Au Cheval's cooks churning out dishes at lightning speed is wildly entertaining.If you haven't gotten this impression already, Au Cheval is not the place for a long, romantic dinner where you make friends with your server. Although our waiter was attentive, he wasn't there to chitchat and took our drink order right away. I went with an Old Fashioned that I really enjoyed, the boyfriend also had a tasty whiskey drink. We started with the bread and butter pickles which were a great way to curb our hunger. As Au Cheval virgins, what else do you think we ordered for dinner? Burgers. With bacon. And egg. Deeeelicious. The single is more than enough food for your average hungry human, but the boyfriend devoured his double, so it's certainly possible to conquer. Highly recommend the fries as a side to your burger. Crisp fries plus mornay plus garlic aioli AND an egg rounds out your heart-stoppingly rich meal incredibly well. Prior to eating at Au Cheval, I wondered if the positive reviews stemmed from the fact that you inevitably arrive drunk after consuming cocktails during your wildly long wait. (Who doesn't like a cheeseburger and other greasy items after they've been drinking? However, I can attest that the food is fantastic and artfully made. Overall, Au Cheval is certainly an experience and I highly recommend a visit. Is it diner prices or anything else you expect from a diner? No, but you're in a West Loop restaurant manned by one of the top restaurateurs in the city. So drink your whiskey, eat your burger, and be happy about it."
"We came here because Food Network said it was the best burger in the USA. OK, they were not exaggerating. #bestburgerever.Three parties, cheese, pork belly, fried egg and pickles. You have to get here! Wow."
Came here for a drink and immediately fell in love. Food looks amazing we sat at the bar so we saw everything and if we hadn't just ate I would have crushed some of EVERYTHING.  GREAT atmosphere and Great music (old school rap) and bacon.  Definitely comin back to this cook lil diner
"the Bad:-the 1 hr wait on a Monday night at 7pm. Even after we received the text message, there was another 15 minute wait to get seated.-no reservations taken (cuz they are supposed to be just a diner)- the diner is small and the booth seats aren't too roomy either. Only 4 people can sit close together or maybe 6 anorexic girls! the Good:- the 1 hr wait. I hear it's over 2 hrs on a weekend. I can't rationalize waiting that long for this place.- Our birthday girl gave this place 2 thumbs up- General Jane's Chicken had just the right crisp and spicy-sweet kick and keeps you wanting more. (ask for a spoon to scoop some sauce on the chicken)- single cheese burger - I won't say this was the best burger ever encountered. It's a decent burger and easy to share. We added a bacon and egg. Their bacon is phenomenal (thick slice and sweet and peppery goodness...mmm). I could do without the egg next time ...if there is a next time- we got fries with monray sauce (a white sauce with cheese essentially). the garlic aioli was delish. this is passable.Service was friendly. I don't suggest coming here with a group more than 4 people."
"I feel that the service could have been better tonight. Our main waiter is excellent. It's  another waiter/busboy that was around. He is not happy with us. Grouchy. When we ask him to reheat one of our item, he didn't like it and ask our waiter to do it. In the end, when he clean up our table he spill the plates content on me!!! Wth. If you don't like your job. Quit. When we talk to the manager about what happen he knew who we were talking about right away! Does this bus boy do this kind of thing to customers often???"
"Crazy yummy food.  Four gras and eggs are awesome and the best burger that I have tried in Chicago yet.My only real complaint is that they don't take reservations and the wait times can be relatively insane, particularly on the weekend.  All of the bar seats run long waiting lists too, so you have to get on the list, then head down the street to get a drink while you wait.Very good food, but you are sort of signing up for 3+ hours of waiting and eating if you go."
"We were told we had to eat a burger here by the friends we were staying with. One of them even proclaimed Au Cheval has the best burger he's ever had. Got here and was told it would be a 1.5 hour wait so I already felt that oh this place is soo good that it has a long wait. 1.5 hours later we head in to get our table. Walk in and hear some amazing hip-hop playing over the speakers and this place feels like an old school bar meets diner. Bar seating that gives you a front row seat to the grill and booths with leather seats and wooden tables with chairs. I was sold on that this is a  seasoned establishment in the area.Started off with the bone marrow - 4 large bones, 4 pieces of toast, and a meat jam (think beef stew meat meets sloppy joe sauce). So rich with every single bite of the toast/marrow. Followed that up with the honey fried chicken. Amazing! Sweet with a little heat and sesame seeds to add to the flavor. They provide fresh wet towels to wipe your fingers afterwards. Finally. We get to the burger and fries. The fries were crispy and yolky once we broke the egg of course. The two sauces they provided were garlic aioli and gravy for the fries. FYI the names for the cheeseburger on the single has 2 patties and the double has 3 patties. We ordered doubles until our waiter told us about this. The burgers were amazing. The first bite was sooo rich. Thankfully I also added their thick cut pepper bacon to it which made it so much better. I've become a fan of thick cut cause it adds a lot more flavor to the bacon. This place is definitely worth the wait and make sure to get there early to beat the dinner/weekend rush."
"Even in Texas, I had heard of the famed Au Cheval burger from a variety of sources. It was therefore a mandatory itinerary item on our Chicago foodcation.We were warned of a wait, but 3.5 hours for any food is ridiculous (even for BBQ in my book). Nevertheless, we braved it out with a pre-dinner at Little Goat and a stroll through Whole Foods.We were finally seated around 10pm and ordered the single cheeseburger and the crispy fries, With all the hype, I was expecting a burger better than I could even imagine, and, probably not unexpectedly, it fell quite short of expectations. It was definitely a good burger, but not 3+ hour wait and $11 good. Best classified as a fancied-up version of a greasy spoon burger, the burger had two thin patties that were flavorful and juicy when fresh, but that dried out quickly during the break I took in-between bites to eat some fries. I'd rank the burger somewhere around the enjoyment level of Shake Shack and Smashburger but with slightly better bread.The crispy fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli, and farm fresh egg were delicious--well, they were delicious with the garlic aioli. The mild mornay sauce remained largely untouched.The restaurant itself was cozy and dark and had a great ambiance. The service was courteous but rushed.This was probably one of our more disappointing meals in the city, but I was glad to have experienced the hype for myself."
"Burgers are to die for and the truffle fries are amazing! If you're a burger lover, you MUST try it!"
Not deserving of all the hype.  Pattie was over greasy and had no flavor. Must be the quality of the meat or simply the factory style set up to cook all the food because of the high demand (may cause then to suffer with the integrity of their recipe).  Ambience is awesome.  Service awesome.  Brew selection stellar.  But the burger is of Boutique Fast Food chains style.  I'll go back once the media frenzy fizzles and get me another burger.  But the bacon was perfection + they have real chefs (demonstrated by the super fried egg that came out on the burger) so I know they can make a better burger.
"I came on a Friday night around 6pm thinking the wait maybe 1 to 1 1/2 hr wait at most since their kitchen just opened at 5pm. I was shocked when the host took down my name and said it'll be 3 1/2 to 4 hrs. wait. I was in disbelief. At this point, that means 10pm. Apparently, ppl get there at around 3pm and sit at the bar to wait until they take names. The host said they filled up their tables to 9pm even before it was 5pm. I've dined here for lunch a couple times before, and it was never this cray. So I had no idea it was this insane. My friends came in from the burbs to try this place, and insisted on waiting. So we waited at the nearby bar Lone Wolf. We waited about 2 hrs, and I got a text that a table was available. So, I guess a lot if people gave up. Thank goodness!We quickly sat down and ordered.Food:- bone marrow with toast was on point- chicken liver with toast was good- foie gras terrine was delicious- single burger is the reason to come againI don't think I'll come back for dinner, but I'll definitely come again for lunch. Service nice too."
"What else can I say about this place that hasn't already been said.. This is my 3rd time going but my first time reviewing. It deserves a review!! Burgers are juicy, fresh, flavorful!! This time i tried the hash brown burger. Although it was delish, I think i'll stick to the burger with the bun. The burgers come with a pickle but if you're a pickle fan, make sure you order the bread and butter pickles. They're a MUST!!The ambience is sexy, lights are dim and the play a nice mix of neo-soul/hip hop/edm type music. Great date place!!Be advised that if yu go during prime hours there is a MAYJAH wait so be prepared and they don't take reservations."
"Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Sure they don't take reservations and you can expect to easily wait 1-2 hours during busy times on the weekend, and good luck finding a table if you have more than 4 people in your group...but where else can you eat hearty gourmet diner food in a unique, trendy setting. A group of 4 of us came here on a Saturday night and knew coming in that there would be a pretty decent wait. It's super small inside so after putting your name down I'd suggest to just head across the street to Haymarket and grab some drinks while you wait. They called us once our table was ready. It honestly wasn't that bad. Time flies when you're knocking back a couple beers. Ambiance: The place was packed and the crowd was pretty lively. Booths lined two of the walls, there were seats at the bar, and I think there were one or two bigger tables in the corner of the restaurant. It felt like a diner, the food tasted like an upscale joint, and they were playing old school hip hop jams on a vintage music player. That's a combo I've never seen before. Service: Even though it was super busy, I thought our waitress did a good job. We were in and out fairly quickly. They brought out the food a few dishes at a time, so we were pretty much continuously eating and never really had a period where we were just sitting there waiting. It works well especially if everyone at the table is just sharing all the food. Now let's get to the important part...the delicious FOOD! We tried to order a bunch of things to at least get a little taste of everything.Roasted Marrow bones - This was actually the first time I've tried bone marrow. Although the slimy texture of the marrow took some getting used to, the flavor was outstanding. Rich, fatty marrow slathered all over crispy, buttered texas toast and topped with a sweet marmalade is a combo I didn't expect to enjoy so much. General Jane's chicken - Pretty big pieces of fried chicken tossed in a sweet and sassy sauce. I'm a sucker for Asian flavored wings and these definitely satisfied my crave.Crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy - Now this is the definition of re-invented breakfast diner food. Duck heart gravy sounded a little intimidating, but it tasted fantastic. Crispy hash browns and gourmet country gravy...what's not to love. One of my favorite dishes of the night.Foie gras w/ scrambled eggs - We pretty much ordered this just because it had foie gras in it. The texture was super silky and smooth, but I think the foie gras flavor got a little lost in the scrambled eggs. Still very tasty though.Fries with mornay/aioli/fried egg - Crispy fries with a thick and creamy cheese sauce...then add some garlic aioli to it...AND they toss a fried egg on top just for the hell of it? Yes please! They seriously read my mind for the best side dish ever. Double cheeseburger w/ egg - Some people say this is one of the best burgers in the city, and I'd have to agree with them. It's so simple yet super flavorful. Throw bacon, cheese, and an egg on top of anything and I'll pretty much eat it. Bologna sandwich - This ain't the Oscar Mayer lunchmeat you packed for school. Talk about a mountain of salty, flavorful meat just covered top to bottom with melty cheese. This was the surprise star in my book. It's a must order every time I go here. Thick cut peppered bacon - It's bacon...I don't even need to explain why I thought this was so delicious. This is the type of next level bacon that I'd eat with a fork and knife. Overall: Au Cheval has found my weakness, serving up meat and potato dishes and throwing fried eggs on top of everything they could find. The wait can be a turn off for some, but if you have some time to burn and you don't mind hanging out for a bit until your table is ready, it's definitely worth it to eat here."
"The BEST BURGER of my life. That is pretty much is all you need to know about this place. This burger will change your life. There is a wait, came here Sunday morning  (around ~11am) and there was a 1.5 hour wait. Definitely worth the wait. You can put your name and number on the list and they will let you know when the table is ready. There's coffee shops on the same street so you can just grab a coffee and wait until they contact you. It's got a small diner feel but cleaner. I got the cheeseburger a cheval ($11.95) and added bacon and a fried egg to my burger (couple more dollars extra). The presentation was excellent. Once I bit in this burger...I could NOT stop saying how f**king delicious it was. Every other word out of my mouth was DELICIOUS. I don't know how they cook it but it is so flavorful and juicy. Your mouth will be in heaven. The bacon is out of this world. Thick cut slice with savory flavor. The fried egg with it's yolk adds a perfect touch to the burger. I was SUPER full after this meal, it will last you awhile. I had MASSIVE food coma but I can't stop thinking about how f**king delicious this burger is. It has like two patties so it is pretty filling, you can also add more patties if you'd like. The cheddar along with the bacon and yolk on the burger is PERFECTION. Just writing this review is getting me all worked up over this burger. NOMS!so just when I thought the burger was the best thing ever on the menu, I had a bite of my friend's fried bologna sandwich- MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH!!! I think it depends what you are craving for but if this is your first time, GET THE BURGER. If I come back next time I'd try other things on the menu because I am pretty confident it will be delicious."
"Amazing place. I recommend the burger and the old fashioned. Also definitely get an order of fries to share. The garlic aioli they serve with the fries is awesome. The old fashioned they make is fantastic. It is strong and mixed well and worth the money. On top of that they have a few original recipe drinks that look interesting too. Solid beer selection too. Maybe a little obsessed with fruit beers, but they have something for everyone on the beer menu. The burger was amazing. Great flavor. Definitely get the bacon because the bacon is the star of the burger. Also make sure you get the egg too. All the best burger in town talk is a little overrated however. This place deserves hype and the five star status but I still think the actual burger flavor is better at Kumas (the burger not giving Kumas credit for toppings or creativity because I know Au Cheval is a great burger partly due to simplicity), but this is definitely right up there and deserves to be tried. The fries were basically perfect and the garlic aioli sauce they give with it was perfect to compliment the fries and made them even better. Definitely worth ordering. I have heard great things about the ham and cheese fondue sandwich and there were so many other things on the menu that looked amazing so I look forward to coming back and checking out some other items. One knock was that our original waiter was awesome. Very personable and fun and attentive, but when shift change came around he handed us off to a pretty horrible waitress who I have nothing good to say about. No smile, no pleasant mood, not much of a greeting and pretty rough service. I don't feel like that is par for the course for this place so I didn't want to ding the restaurant for it, but it definitely happened."
"2 hours and 40 min wait. Already coming into this place with sucker stamped on my forehead. Burger was good. Best in the states? It's up there, but that's a heavy title to carry. It was really good. Bacon was thick, delicious, with honey or maple or whatever added to it. Add the egg and all that delicious burger  and pork fat/grease and I'm happy. It's ****ing rich, I'm fine with that, but some will be turned off. Apparently lunchtime wait is 10-45 minutes. This is a place that doesn't need reviews, they have a quality product and the hype will carry."
"I'm going to say it: I didn't love the burger. American cheese as the only option at a place that's supposed to be this classy? Nt my favorite.The fries were pretty delicious though, which made up for the mediocre burger."
Hands down the best burger I've had in Chicago.
"I was visiting from LA and was told by several people and friends that this place is a MUST EAT so of course I went. When we got there the hostess informed us that the wait was 3-4 hours, but waiting for bar seating was also an option (open seating, first come first serve). We were just going to leave because waiting that long just wasn't worth it, but it seemed like no one was really waiting for the bar seating so we decided to wait for it. We waited only about 30-40 minutes and was seated at the bar! We both ordered the cheeseburger with an egg and bacon inside and shared a side of fries. I was really excited when the burger came as it looked delicious, but I was shortly followed by disappointment. The burger was way too thick and did not have any special seasoning/flavoring that stood out or that I can even taste. It was very plain and salty, and just too much for me. I ate the burger with a knife and a fork because it was too big (and messy because of the egg) to bite into. I really wanted to like this place because I love gourmet burgers, but it just didn't satisfy us whatsoever. I prefer Umami Burger or In-N-Out over Au Cheval any day! I would rate the burger like a 2, but giving them 3 stars because our server was super nice!"
"If you are visiting or it's your first time at Au Cheval, get the burger. The single is actually a double and the double is actually a triple. Get it how it comes or add an egg. It is probably one of thee best burgers I have ever had! Perfect bun to patty to cheese ratio! Awesome atmosphere with awesome music. I love sitting up at the bar and watching all the delicious meals being prepared! The cooks are always having so much fun, joking with one another, dancing and singing to the classic rock music playing.I would say don't go hungry, go a couple of hours before you are hungry and get a drink. Prepare to wait a bit, it is definitely worth it! We once went at 7PM on a Friday, just to see if would get lucky, it was a 4-hour wait -- no lie!"
"""They have the best burger EVER!""""The burger is sooooo good!""""You have to get the burger!""Well, I came, I saw, and I conquered the burger. It was aite. I say it was definitely top 10 burgers but I chose top 10 because I am not detail oriented enough to actually pinpoint that many burger experiences. It was definitely good but the hype killed any potential love/lust I might have had that night. I had the thick cut bacon and egg as topping and it still just didn't meet all the heavy claims as stated above. Oh well.BUT wait.. Au Cheval is still the home to the best dish I have ever had in Chicago. And it wasn't a fluke!! I have had it multiple times and each one was mind altering ""please stop talking to me unless you want to talk about this dish"" good. It is the foie gras egg scramble. Aaahhhhh!!  I could write a sonnet about how it is so perfectly decadent and delicate at the same time. Please do yourself a favor and try it at least once. It is perfectly yummy as leftovers too! Another great dish was chilaquiles or, as I say, bougie nachos.  The portions are HUGE so unless you have more than 2 people with a hearty appetite, I'd opt for the smaller size.Please expect at least an hour wait (but realistically, it is going to be two) regardless of dinner or brunch. I arrived at 5:30pm once and it was still 2 hrs!  11am - 1.5 hrs!  My tip: I usually just go across to Girl and the Goat since they are always able to seat me and I might either grab a small bite or drinks there, or just give up entirely and end up eating there instead."
"OK.. let me start by saying that the place was PACKED!! If I was claustrophobic!!??! I wouldn't have survived!! However, I was told that I would be seated in 45 minutes...and I was. I had to sit at the bar but it was cool. I was by myself since the wife was out of town. Anyway, the waiter that served me was named ""Brandon""(..I told 'em I'd remember..). His service was very good. Asked what I wanted...and delivered with kindness. ..can't ask for more. He asked me what I wanted to drink, I had a Coke with Cherry Juice(, or Grenadine..) I turned around and it was in front of me!!! The bartender was listening and prepared the drink for me before I could breathe!!!..AWESOME. Her name is ERIN!!!  AWESOME job!!!... OK, I had a Single Cheeseburger topped with a Fried Egg..with Bacon on the side. I kinda expected what I was getting. Their ""Single"" is more like a ""DOUBLE"" Cheeseburger!!...and I said what God said after he created the earth..."" It was Good.."" ... OMG The BURGER WAS DA BOMB!!!! My waiter(Brandon) stopped and asked me,"" How's your burger""?... I just looked at him. I was trying to find the words...all I could do is raise my eyebrows and nod my head...and all I can say is the burger was SO good!!!...and I plan on going back to have another one. I had the butter& bread pickles for the appetizer. I completely enjoyed my experience...the ONLY thing is that they could use a inch more space!!... I told the people sitting next to me this place is like Kuma's Korner minus the decibels...MAYBE even a step ahead with the flavor of the burger...BUT definitely minus all the volume....If they had a LITTLE more ROOM I'd give 'em Six stars!!!"
"Dang, that burger? The one with the egg and pork belly? One of the best things I've EVER put into my gullet. Seriously, if you value your life, you'll make it here for one of those burgers. Servers were awesome, and funny, and our wait was reasonable. Prices were, too. I need this place to relocate into my condo, STAT."
"This place was recently bestowed the title of best burger in the country.  Is it deserving of that title? In a word, Yes. They have an awesome beverage program.  Excellent selection of beers ranging from light to robust. They can make the best old fashioned cocktails if you so choose, and their burgers are delicious.  Normally I don't need anything on my burgers but when they offer up a bottle of Sriracha hot sauce, I can't say no to that."
"Very disappointed in this place. The food is fantastic, but ever since Thrillist has gone crazy with providing it 5 star reviews you can NEVER get a seat! The wait used to be an hour now you're looking at 3 1/2-4 hours & they don't take reservations!!!!!!!! It's crazy and unfortunately, Chicago has other places that sell just as great burgers. Until they change their seating policy I'm taking my business somewhere else."
"This is just a review of my experience trying to get a seat.  I've now been to Au Cheval twice without being able to eat.  The first time, I went in a group of four on a Friday evening and we were told at 7pm that the wait for a table was 3-4 hours.  I wasn't expecting to get a seat immediately, but a 3-4 hour wait at a restaurant that doesn't take reservations?  Give me a break!The second time I attempted to eat at Au Cheval was this past weekend.  I went with my girlfriend on Saturday at around 1pm.  The hostess said that the wait was about 2 hours, and that the kitchen would be closed then.  What good is a restaurant with no kitchen?  No thanks!  There was no offer of a table at 5pm when the kitchen reopens, but I suspect that if I had shown up again at 5pm, there would once again be a 4 hour wait.Au Cheval doesn't accept reservations.  I get that.  However, how am I supposed to actually eat there?  Once my name is on their list, I could theoretically get a call at any time and have to show up.  I don't want to go to a bar or another restaurant to wait, because I would actually like to be hungry when I eat at Au Cheval.  Do you just put your life on hold for several hours as you stand idly by waiting for Au Cheval to get around to you?  When I'm hungry, I want to eat.  Period.  If I want to go to a nice, busy place, I'll make reservations and then plan to be hungry then.  What I do not do is obligate myself to eat any time between now and 4+ hours from now at a restaurant's discretion."
"The rating was more for the service we received yesterday.The food was amazing as always. However, our order was taken 15 mins after being seated. Our appetizer came after our burger? And the fries came after we had already eaten our burger! Terrible service for the hour and a half wait."
"Okie, here's the deal. This is the BEST burger you'll ever in your life. IN YOUR LIFE! I've dined at Au Cheval three times prior to this review. And I must say that the only let down of this establishment is the time it takes to get a table. Two out of the three times I've been there I have waited two and a half to three hours. With that said, I am happy to wait that amount of time because their burgers are beyond fabulous. Au Cheval is located around a whole slew of restaurants and bars. So when your waiting for a table (they take down your number when you request a table), you can go get silly at another place.  Once you get that magically text about your table being ready, prepare yourself. Don't be silly and think you'll be ordering anything but a burger. Im serious...order the burger. The ""single burger"" is actually a double, and the ""double burger"" is actually a triple. Get the ""double"" burger, it's more bang for your buck and you probably need something in your stomach from the three hours of drinking you did waiting for a table. Get a side of fries with your burgers, too. Beyond scrumptious!! I've never had dessert there, because I'm stuffed from my double burger and fries. I'm sure it's lovely though. Side note: I would not recommend this place for a first date due to the wait time and the volume levels. I suggest smaller groups so you won't have to wait too long for a table. Bar is first come, first serve. I've prayed on people at the bar before with no shame."
"(4)~ very good overall food & serviceMY MENU:DRINKS:* ""Mourning Wood""(Local Beer) = (4) very good...infused with coffee and aged in oak barrels* Root Beer(Draft) = (4) very good* Water(tap) = (3.25)goodFOOD:* Beef Marrow & Beef Cheek Marmalade(w. toast) = (4) very good* Double Burger w. Fried Egg & Thick Bacon = (3.75) Good...but not the best I've had...Note:  The Bacon, while thick, is sweet w. caramelized(sugar)...I prefer the savory/salty kind.  Also a Single is actually a double patty and a Double is actually a triple patty.  Had I known this I would have ordered a Single;)* Fries(w. Garlic Aioli) = (3) ok"
"The single cheeseburger is hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had! I am a ketchup lover and I don't even put ketchup on it bc it's so good! I prefer the burger with the egg, but note, it gets really messy!The fries with the aoili are also a must get - but better for sharing with the table vs getting your own order!Tip - if you want to get in without a long wait, get there ~15 min before they open on a Saturday or Sunday morning!"
"Was informed from my friend that Au Cheval has the best burger in town. Considering we have been to Kumas, Burger Bar, and Butcher and the Burger (to name a few), I was definitely intrigued to try it out. So tonight I did.Place was crowded but turnover at the bar was fast and got seats there. Place is dark with trendy music playing throughout. Other reviews have said that the music is too loud but it's nowhere near Kuma's sound level. Plenty of local beers on tap along with a list of alcoholic concoctions. Kept it simple with a beer to go with my Double Cheeseburgee (three patties) and Matzoh Ball Soup. Yes matzoh ball soup. I rarely have it and at a non deli no less. Soup was good albeit different than standard preparation. The broth was more like a soy/miso combination  compared to the usual chicken stock. It was good (the matzoh ball was large) but not sure it was worth $8. Speaking of pricing, the double burger was only $12 but if you wanted an egg ($2 extra) or bacon ($5 extra) you were going to pay for it. Not to mention fries are an additional charge too.Thankfully the burger was very good. It reminded me of Eagle's Deli in Boston as it is just meat and cheese (and a pickle). Simple yet effective. Is it my fave burger? No but it was damn good. The rest of the menu had some crazy items I will like to try my next visit as well."
"I love this French American Gastropub!From the decor, to the bar and down to their delicious food! I feel like you can't go wrong with any of their entrees or selections from their delectable menu!  I got their Hyoka IPA, like our waiter suggested and it was swell!  We ordered up the Matzo Ball Soup, which warmed the body up from the fall coldness in Chicago.  They gave a generous portion of the Matzo Ball and the broth was heart to the soul and mind.  We also ordered their Foie Gras Scrambled Eggs with French Toast on the side!  It was Ah-Maz-Ing!  The flavor of the caramelized onions and tenderness of the foie gras, was delicious!  The buttery French Toast used for dipping, made it the perfect, complimentary combo!  As for their Burger, it was spot on and do get it with the bacon!  It made it all the more yummy!  Thery offer up Chicken Wings, Bone Marrows and other glorious, gourmet gastropub delights.Do sit at the booths if you do have the option to!  It's comfy and cozy for dining!Au Cheval, I was enamored!"
We waited 1.5 hrs for burgers. You have to go there early otherwise it's always at least one hr wait time. You have to order bacon and egg for ur burger. It's a must!!! Tasted so delicious with bacon n egg!
"I'd been reading reviews about this place before I ventured here on a date. I met up with a friend on a Thursday. The place was full, but not crowded. The restaurant looked like a dimly lit bar with tables in the back - nothing special. There were playing acid jazz and hip hop music which I can greatly appreciate. We both ordered the cheeseburgers that came with 2 patties We also had fries, an app that I don't remember and couple of glasses of wine. I snuck a peek at the bill when it came and I was shocked to see that the bill was well over $100. The atmosphere, service nor food were worth that much, in my opinion. I'm not sure if I would return to this overpriced establishment."
"This was the best burger that has now ruined it for me. All other burgers will just be ""blah"" in comparison. It was seasoned and cooked to perfection. The fried egg and thickest cut of bacon you've ever seen were the perfect additions to my burger.  I can see why this burger was named ""Best Burger in America"". Staff was great. We sat at the end of the bar which had a view of the kitchen. Even though they were having a very busy lunch rush, the staff was constantly cleaning their prep areas. Atmosphere had a cool vibe and played music on this old reel-to-reel player."
"We grabbed a couple of the first come first serve seats at the bar (there are only 6!) and luckily avoided the 5.5 hour wait. The service at the bar was fast and friendly, and we were enjoying America's best burger after polishing off one of Au Cheval's strong drinks (The Flapper was amazing). We kept it simple and ordered a single (2 patties) and double (3 patties) cheeseburger + fried egg + bacon along with a side of fries.  (If I could do it again we would have ordered the smashed potatoes- they looked amazing).  The bacon is amazing- thick cut and smokey, it was like a slice of pork belly! The elements came together in a great way- and made our meal highly deserving of being one of America's best burgers. Will hopefully be back for brunch!"
"Amazing burger and can-o-fries. My tongue wanted another full helping of both, but my stomach said no. Definitely going back soon."
"The burger that it is highly known for is rich in flavor and not bad. I wouldn't say it's the absolute best burger, but I think it's worth the try for everyone. What I do recommend is the garlic fries (thinly cut). I thought it was absolutely delicious!! Be prepared to wait a long time. Just put your name down and go to a bar next door or nearby and come back and there will be your seats ready for you!"
I give this place 3 stars and that is being generous because the waiter was nice. I def do not see what all the fuss of this place is about. The two-three hour wait for this OK burger is beyond ridiculous. I have had much better minus the wait. The music was good and I liked the old school record player they had.  Oh and the pickle back shots were good as well!   Tip: your wait will be a little shorter if u wait for the 4 stools along the left side of bar to open up. Those are first come first serve.
"Best burger in America award goes to this place!!! Make sure to get it with the egg and bacon. The 3 hour wait that we were quoted upon our arrival was actually like 45 minutes (don't leave, stay inside at the counter so they see you). However, definitely worth the wait and can't wait to return next time I'm in Chicago."
"Ok, so, the burger.  As good as you've heard? I'd say so.  I mean, pickles were sliding out of this thing. But for the love of God, if you go to this joint, get the bacon.  On the side, on the burger, whatever.  Days later and all I can think of is that bacon.  Add to that the friendly welcome we received right before the kitchen closed, the explanation from the hostess that the burger was all about the execution and not fancy ingredients (agree), and the funky (apparently functional) 8-track thingy machine and this place gets five stars.  Hope to return for dinner next time I'm in Chicago."
"This place is famous for its burgers, regarded by some as the best burgers in the US. First thing you should know about Au Cheval is that it's tiny, they don't take reservations, and once you get there and are added to the waiting list, you'll have to wait on average over an hour (I've been asked to wait up to 2h15).As I said, the place is tiny so there's no waiting area: you have to wait outside. Conveniently enough, they take your cellphone number and text you when you're table is next, which means you can go anywhere and get back within 10min of the text. They are many places nearby to get a beer. We ordered the burger (had to) and the glazed bacon. Both were wonderful! Can't complain about anything at all! I was advised to order the Au Cheval style burger (with an egg on top), which I personally would suggest otherwise. The egg's flavor dominated the rest of the burger. Not ideal. Staff is friendly, price is very affordable, and service is quite fast. Overall a great experience, although I'd be hesitant on whether waiting over an hour for a burger is worthwhile (same opinion about the recently opened ShakeShack in downtown Chicago). I give it 4 stars precisely because of that."
"Best cheeseburger in America?  It's here!  Trust me.  If it isn't the best, it is close.  This place is perfect for late night drinks and food. Great vibe!! I love coming here when visiting Chicago."
"Au Cheval. One of the most famous place in Chicago. Popularized for its amazing burgers and fancy cusine, it received a Bib Gourmand from the world famous Michelin Guide. What is a Bib Bourmand you ask? The Bib Gourmand designate very good restaurants that offer good value. (Two courses and a glass of wine for $40 or less) Basically an honorable mention in the Michelin Guide.I was able to go on a Wednesday at aroune 5:30 where there were actual openings, however I had to wait for someone who arrived at around 6. Since I put my name down early, we were able to get a seat as soon as she was here, but we could only get a bar seat and not a booth as the wait for the booths were now for bigger parties and over an hr wait. Which really isn't bad since I tried to come here maybe 2 weeks ago and the wait was over 3 hours long. As I waited, I was at the bar looking at some drinks. The cocktails were $10 to $12, with $3.50 whiskey shots, and the beers ranged from $4 to $12. There were a wide variety of beers to choose from and the bartender was very knowledgeable about them. The waitress was also very attentive to if I waanted to order, maybe a little too attentive. I ordered a pint of Devoir Penrosefor $5 that was ""bright and sessionable saison, very lightly funky, 4.3%"" which kinda just tasted like a variation orange wheat beer. I really like hefes so it was very enjoyable.After seating, we ordered fairly quickly since I basically wanted the burger and some fries. The bar seats were directly facing the kitchen and you can feel the heat from the broiler on top and the heat from the stove. It had a very cool feel to it and you can watch how they made everything. There are hooks under the bar so you can hang your jacket or the ladies can hang their purses. However, it felt very cramped and I felt like I was going to bump the people sitting next to me every time I was going to move.The food arrived fairly quickly since they lay down like 10+ patties at once. My single cheeseburger contained 2 patties, 2 slices of cheese, 2 pieces of thick bacon, and an egg. (The bacon-$2 and egg-$1 are addons) The burger looked beautiful as it arrived. The patties and cheese were oozing juices, the buns toasted, the bacon was nice and firm, and the egg looked perfectly done with it's garnishes on it. The cut in view looked just as good, if not better. The fries came in a metal cup with paper all around it with an interesting tasting mayo. My mouth was watering in anticipation to bite into my award winning burger. With the first bite, it was too salty. They made the burger too salty. With the second bite, the juices were all over my mouth and started dripping down my hands. Normally, I would love that, but it was so juicy that everything was falling apart from the oil and other liquids that came out. I'm the kind of person who will eat faster if things are falling apart or all over the place so my burger got inhaled I wasn't able to savor this $15+ burger. Outside of the saltiness and the fluids all over the place, it was really well done. Nothing was dry, the flavors did well with each other, and it still gave a firm bite, despite being soaked. The fries however, all I can say are bad things about them. They were incredibly salty. There were black spots on at least half of the fries. We can see this in poor quality potatoes, but I wasn't sure if the black spots were edible so I snapped them off for good measure. Actually, I have one good thing to say about them. They were hot and crunchy, which is my favorite part in fries so they have that going for them.I was extremely disappointed in Au Cheval with their use of salt. If I had the time to wait in their absurdly long line, I can see myself giving them another chance. I would also recommend them dropping their price on their cheeseburgers. $10.95 for 2 patties, 2 slices of cheese, on a toasted bun is overpriced to say the least. They certainly are taking their Bib Gourmand award to their prices. 3 Stars.For more reviews, come check out eatpeterepeat.com"
"They don't take reservations and it's the kind of place where you have to wait for hours, even on a weeknight.  But a tiny voice in my head told me I should just drive to Au Cheval at 7pm on a Thursday night, and I did, and there was a seat at the bar just waiting for me.So of course I had the famous burger.  The fame is justified.  The patties are moist and flavorful, the bun is soft but toasted enough to hold the sandwich together, and the pickles and toppings add salt, tang, and a rich melting yolk. (As you might guess from the name of the place, the theme of the restaurant is putting an egg on it.)Now it's not actually my favorite genre of burger -- I like a single thick meaty patty, a grill flame, and exotic toppings (think Kuma's Corner).  Au Cheval is instead an elevation of the diner-style with a classic accent, with thin patties, flat-top, egg, pickle, butter.  I'd describe it as everything a Shake Shack burger might have wished it could be.  But even if I'd prefer the burger at Kuma's, I can recognize transcendence when I taste it.You shouldn't really need me to tell you to go to Au Cheval.  If you're reading this Yelp! entry, you KNOW you should go to Au Cheval; the only question is when to go and how long you are willing to stand in line to accomplish it.  And worse, you can't go just once, because the first time you go you have to get the burger.  And once you have the burger you'll find yourself wondering about the chicken liver, the fried chicken, the marrow bones and even the fried bologna sandwich.  So you'll have to go back.I think I need to find some friends who are willing to stand in line with me at no-reservations joints like this one."
"I started working in the city in the West Loop about a month ago and this place was on my short list of lunch places to try.  I have since been there three times total. I was worried about it taking too long to get it in over a lunch hour, but I already have my routine down to beat the crowds.  First, I don't eat any breakfast before commuting into the city as I want to get there early for my own special brunch.  I try to get there about 10-15m before they open at 11AM someday early in the week.  There's always a line awaiting me to queue up in, usually about 20 people.  But so far I haven't had any trouble getting a counter spot right away, which I prefer because I love watching the line cooks in action in this very small, cramped space.First time I ordered the double, but it's really a triple patty.  The single is really a double.  So their ""single"" is more than enough for me.  Unlike a lot of places known for burgers, they don't offer a dozen different varieties of toppings.  It's pretty basic.  A few pickles, American cheese and their house made dressing.  You can--and should--pay a few extra bucks for the egg and bacon.  Bacon is a serious couple of 1/2"" thick slabs and the egg is so perfectly cooked when you mash the burger together you're guaranteed to have the yolk running all over your fingers and down your arm as you sink your teeth into it.  Buns are perfectly toasted, burgers have always been perfectly seasoned and cooked (no one asks how you want it cooked, you'll get it medium rare and like it).  Fries with garlic aioli are amazing and enough to share with someone.I will definitely put this the pantheon of ""best burgers ever"".  Everything about it is perfect.  I don't know if I could endure a 2-3 hour wait as some have described for dinner, but I found the lunch crowd was not too much of an issue if you get there early enough to be one of the first seated."
"The separate burger ingredients were good. Not sure about the combination, since I've had better burgers. Got the Au Cheval burger with thick cut bacon and fried egg.Music is good, not good for people who don't like loud music while eating food. Crowd is relatively in their 20s-30s."
"Got my name on the list, and waited an hour. There are tons of bars to go to while you wait.Split the burger with a friend, very good burger. Lots of beards/tattoos and affordable drinks. Lots of rich food, wish I had gone there for brunch. The other plates on tables around us looked fantastic.The cool kids staff was actually very warm and polite. Great vibe in this place. I would definitely try it again when I'm more hungry. Was fun despite being busy. Staff seemed prepared and relaxed."
"Came here at 10:30PM on a Wednesday night and they told us the wait was 30 minutes. We got a table at 15 minutes later at 10:45 and from 10:45 onward there was no wait for anyone. The ambiance is nice and the service was good. My husband and I shared the double cheese burger with an egg which was about $14 for the burger plus maybe $3 for the egg. It was plenty of food considering we had a light dinner around 5PM already! We also shared the fries among the table (there were three of us dining and we didn't even come close to finishing the fries - I think up to 5 people could share those). I actually didn't care for the fries at all - I could really taste the fat / lard and it was a flavor I really didn't like - so I'd skip that.Overall - the burger was absolutely delicious and as good as everyone says!The kitchen serves until midnight every night, so it was perfect for us as my brother was driving through town late at night.TIP: Au Cheval (and every restaurant by the same owners) is BYOB for WINE ONLY. Corkage fee? None, you just have to share a glass of wine with a different table! This great feature is hardly promoted so make sure to take advantage!"
"I had a great experience here. I was the first of my party of 3 to arrive and put our names down. This was a Tuesday at around 5:15 and not a lot of people were around. They can't seat you until your entire party shows up so I waited until 5:45 until we were all present. I periodically checked in with the hostess and she was super nice. I was concerned with wait til since I saw a lot of people walk in. Once our party was present, she let us know the wait would be around 20-25 minutes, while others who were just walking in had to wait 1-1.5 hrs.Once seated our server was laid back and so nice. I ordered the single burger (2 patties - 4 oz each) with everything (egg and bacon and your usual toppings). The burger was great, but not as extrodinary as I've heard. I wasn't a huge fan of the bacon. It was quite thick which took over the taste of the burger.The fries with the monray and garlic aoili sauces were superb.Great food experience and great staff. I'm glad I tried it, but I'm not sure if I'd be willing to wait 2+ hours to eat."
"Au Cheval - Best burger joint in ChicagoStory:Before going to Au Cheval I heard many individuals in Chicago continuously rave about this place.  Friends kept telling me ""Au Cheval best burger in Chicago""Before I ate at Au Chaval, I attempted twice before to enter the place.  Unfortunately, this restaurant does not take reservations so I lucked out the past because I did not want to wait 40min-1.5hours.So on April 16th, I decided to make a third attempt and enter Au Chaval solo.  In this case, I was seated at the bar within 10 minutesI ordered a regular cheese burger with Bacon...it was delicious, top notch, $18, a cost well spent.Two girls next to me ordered the Boloney sandwich which they stated was better than my burger. I took pictures but cannot tell you how it tastedBy the pictures, viewers may assume this is just another greasy burger joint, but don't be quick to judge. This is the real deal, the best burger joint in Chicago"
"Nike and I came here one day for a late dinner. The place was packed but we were able to get a table fairly quickly. Our waiter was attentive and friendly.We both ordered the omelette with kale, oyster mushrooms, and morel jack cheese.  The eggs were silky and glistened in the candlelight. Each bite was a bit of sweet heaven and made me think of a simpler time.The smashed potatoes with roasted garlic gravy...words..can't be formed to describe the ecstasy I was in after eating this. Hands down one of the BEST potato dish I ever eaten, heck I am salivating just thinking about it.My only qualm, is that they should have some more vegetarian or poultry/seafood dishes."
"Au Cheval would get 4.5 stars from me, if that were possible on Yelp. We love it!We arrived at 4:00, an hour before the kitchen reopened, and nursed our delicious martini (me) and bourbon old fashioned -- I have to say that their martini was one of the best that I've ever had. And they have blue cheese-stuffed green olives, which of course made the drink even better.We ordered the chicken (loved it, but it seemed overpriced ($18) for six pieces of glazed chicken) and two orders of fries - honestly, the gravy that accompanies their fries+fried egg was perfect. I could have just eaten fries and gravy all night long (luckily for my waistline, I did not). Au Cheval's interior is really chill -- it's like a combination of industrial and masculine styles, almost like steampunk. And the seating is great -- plush booths near the bar/kitchen, tables towards the back. I felt comfortable in Au Cheval the minute we stepped inside. It was a great place to enjoy happy hour with friends."
"Heard about this place on Food Network and had to try it on our trip to Chicago. I was not disappointed. I ordered the ""single"" cheeseburger with egg, which is two beef patties and my hubby ordered the ""single"" cheeseburger plain. We shared an order of French fries which is enough for two, it came with a garlic dipping sauce which was wonderful. He had ice tea, I just had water which put our ticket round $40 including tip. We got there about half an hour after it opened on a Saturday and had about an hour and half wait time. Food was worth it, great service and music. Will definitely go back!"
"Amaze balls!!! bone marrow Delish! I  am not a hamburger person but the cheese burger with egg and bacon was mouth watering good and the duck pâté was fatty and Devine.  Big fan of the Mourning wood beer,  the infusion of coffee in beer is genius!  Definitely would come back!"
"I had to try the infamous cheeseburger from Au Cheval before leaving Chicago. My roommate and I went early Thursday evening around 5:30pm since we heard the wait can get pretty long. To our surprise, they had an open table and we were seated immediately.  The restaurant is very different than what I expected--I thought it was going to feel more....French? But it was more a gastropub-diner atmosphere with loud music. Naturally I ordered the single cheeseburger (which comes with 2 patties) with a fried egg and a side of the thick cut bacon. My friend got an omelette with oyster mushrooms, kale and cheese. We shared the fries which were delicious with their garlic aioli. I also got the root beer they had on draft which I liked a lot. My burger came out really fast, but they ended up messing up the omelette somehow and it took awhile for it to arrive. They comped it for the inconvenience which was super nice of them. I thought the burger was pretty good, but not as spectacular as I was expecting from all the hype. It was super messy with the fried egg and maybe I'm not an burger with egg type of person because I'd probably get it without the egg next time. I tried a bite of my friends omelette which tasted really good. I would go back and maybe try some of their other offerings like the liver and toast."
"YUM!This place hits the spot when it comes to burgers and chilaquiles! We came by here for lunch on Saturday and there was an 1.5 hour wait. Because we live close by, we decided to go to the gym, work out and burn off some of the calories we would soon be indulging it. Boy was it worth it! We got to sit in a big booth at the back of the restaurant, which was a great view and ambiance for a first time visitor (me!). We ordered two breakfast beers, the Atwater Blueberry Cobbler and the Founders Dirty Bastard. Both were so delicious and potent, we were really happy with our selections. We ordered the Cheeseburger a Cheval (I wonder if this a play off of Pulp Fiction's Cheeseburger Royale) with bacon, Fries with Mornay Sauce/Garlic Aioli/Fried Farm Egg, and the small Chilaquiles (which are not small at all).Every single thing we ate was AMAZING! I can't remember the last time I had a burger with so much flavor and that was so tender and juicy all at the same time. The ""single"" burger is really a double patty and quite filling. The bacon is a thick succulent slab of meat, and very well seasoned. The homemade pickle topped this off in the perfect matter for me. I am a little obsessive of pickles, so I found this to be delicious. The horseradish perfectly complimented the pickles, cheese, and burger on the inside. I really can't wait to go back here to get another burger!The Fries were really warm and crispy, but I was not the biggest fan of the mornay sauce. The garlic aioli was a little piece of heaven for me. There was also a good amount of cheese on the fries, which I did not expect. The fried egg on my burger and on the fries was a bit too much. Next time, I will just stick to the regular fries for $4 less.The Chilaquiles were one of the best I ever had at any restaurant. They were fresh with cilantro, pickled onions, thinly sliced jalapenos, homemade guacamole, sour cream, beans, and eggs. The salsa verde is spicy and out of this world! I wish I had more room to eat more of these, but I will have to come back just for a plate of this. The small order is quite large and can easily be shared between two people. See the pictures attached for all three food items we ordered!"
"My coworker said you have to go try Aucheval as their burger will change your life forever. And so it did...I came here around 9 pm hoping to get a seat at the bar but even for myself , I had to wait an hour for a seat at the bar.. Really?? Well I'm already here so might as well wait. I gave my phone number and went outside to get some wine in little goat. An hour passed by and I came back to the place. I checked with the hostess as it has been close to an hour and she was surprised to see me that I waited and said oh yeah those seats by the bar , you can grab now as they are first come first serve. WTF!!!!I could have just waited inside instead of going somewhere else to wait for an available seat. Anyway I didn't complain at that moment as I was hungry and tired so I just grabbed an empty seat by the bar. That is why you have yelp so you can tell other people and the management of poor hostess manners. She's not really doing her job!! I know this place is crowded and super busy but that is no way to treat someone like me who's patiently waiting for a seat by herself. And to  try to shoo me off by telling me I had to wait for a seat at the bar when obviously it's first come first serve!!! No wonder the hostess was surprised to see me back. And immediately said all seats by the bar are first come first serve. dear management. - this is how you will slowly lose customers. Bad manners/ rude hostesses Luckily my server was very friendly and sweet and made some good suggestions. These 3 stars are for the burger and the waitress. BTW - the burger single party is actually two patties and its huge !I will come back and see you again soon this summer."
"If you want to get goosebumps from a burger go here! Probably one of the top 3 I've had in Chicago (up there with big jones and Mindys hot chocolate). Before you go make sure you're prepared for the 1.5hr+ wait though (plenty of bars around to go get a drink).The restaurant is pretty tiny, but it's worth it. Definitely get bacon and cheese on your burger too...yummy."
"Best cheeseburger I've ever had in my entire life. The place truly lives up to the hype. Make sure you ask for the bacon and egg, they will not ask you if you want it. Also, their fries do not get enough attention either, absolutely delicious. You need to make sure you go at a very random time, otherwise you will wait at least 2 hours before being seated. The place has very limited seating. However, with that being said, the burger is 100% worth the wait."
"This restaurant definitely lives up to the hype. I'm lactose intolerant so I couldn't have the famous cheeseburger, but I had the bone marrow with the ""root root"" beer, and it was great. The toast was a little too butter heavy, but that was just my preference. My friends loved their cheesebugers, which they ordered with an egg and bacon. Menu was pretty basic; beer and wine on one side, entrees and burgers on the other. All additions to the cheeseburger cost extra.Bills were delivered to the table. Server did not offer to split the check, which was pretty standard in a nice Chicago restaurant.Parking is HARD to find. I can only imagine what it's like finding parking on a weekend, let alone a weekday. Take a taxi or Uber it because we spent almost 15 minutes finding parking.On a Thursday night at 5:30, there was no wait. Our server wasn't very attentive, and the environment wasn't too friendly, but it had a classy and cool vibe. I would go again to try another entree with another beer."
"I don't update reviews often and never without purpose, so after another exceptional visit last month I want to sing their praises again. That and I had what may have been the best espresso I have ever had, which includes ones I've had at some of the best places in the world.For me, what makes a restaurant as good as it gets are the combination of high quality food, consistency of the dishes, top notch service, and all set in the right atmosphere. Au Cheval hits and surpasses each one of these.The Food:On this last visit we ordered:Roasted Marrow Bones, Beef Cheek Marmalade & Toast - just as incredible as always. Each component to this plate on their own are great, but when all are combined together, they become other worldly.General Jane's Honey-Fried Chicken with Chili, Sesame Seeds & Cilantro - delicious, juicy and crispy all at the same time. The warm towels to clean up with were much appreciated.Burger - I've had their famous burger before and did again on my most recent visit. To be perfectly honest, it is not my favorite burger, but it is damn good and as I said in my previous review, add the pork belly.Simple Prep of Fresh Fish - The day I went, it was Salmon and it was great.Crispy Potato Hash with Duck Heart Gravy - Amazing!! Next to the bone marrow, this is my new favorite dish. This may be the best 10 bucks you ever spend!Espresso - Oh lordy was this good. It was so damn smooth, like silk on your pallette. My brother, who worked here briefly, told me that an espresso master came in from Japan to teach some of the staff how to make the perfect espresso. Job well done!!I don't like eating big meals too late, but I need to order their chilaquiles sometime which are only available after midnight. They always have a fantastic beer list and their cocktails look great too.The Service:Exceptional, friendly, knowledgeable and there when you need them, invisible when you don't. I called a few weeks after my visit to ask about their amazing espresso. Ethan was so nice and accommodating in working to find out all that I wanted to know. It turns out that the local roasters they use make a special espresso blend only for this restaurant group.The Atmosphere:Cool, sexy, intimate, with great music (always a plus).Tip: they are often very busy, but it's worth the wait. While you are waiting, I'd suggest grabbing a drink just a few places over at Maude's Liquor Bar (review to come) which has the same ownership along with exceptionally made cocktails by talented and focused mixologists in a chic atmosphere. They do have food here too which looks fantastic, but save your appetite for Au Cheval and then come here on a separate occasion to try their food."
"One of those hyped-up foodie havens in Chicago that ACTUALLY live up to the hype.   Definitely go. Just go.  Be prepared to wait, but it's worth it. Grab a drink at Lone Wolf next door.What I love:- Burger was actually the best I've had in Chicago, and top-3 all time. (Redcoat tavern in Detroit, and the country club I caddied at as a kid are in there too, but the latter is probably mostly nostalgia and the fact it was free and I was a broke 16-year-old)- Beer list is cool and even has a local section vs. just putting all the craft stuff together. nice touch.- Appetizers. If i didn't love the damn burger so much I would go back and fill up just on apps. We had the foie gras - great touch with the texas toast - and the bone marrow.  THAT SAUCE. I don't know what it was but it was fruity and savory at the same time.  Dear lord i was in heaven.What I like:- Duck heart gravy fries (i think - was getting drunk on lipids and suds)- price on the burger (and for the whole meal) wasn't crazy high- casual atmosphereWhat I don't like:- DO NOT GO with a party of more than 4, especially if your group includes large derrieres. You will be uncomfortable.- Wait times suck. Is what it is. We waited 1.5 hrs on a Monday night...yikes.- Waitstaff can be  slightly aloof in the hipstery ""we are crazy popular and awesome at our chosen craft of burgerbliss. if you are pissed and never come back, we will survive and thrive without your moolah""  Again, comes with the territory to some extent.- Prices on beers are crazy, but again, this is getting to be par for the course for the area.  Can someone please open a restaurant with $5 craft beers?? I mean $7+ is just greedy.Anyway, hopefully some of this was new info but probably not.  Enjoy your burger!"
"I will admittedly say that their cheeseburger is not the best cheeseburger I've ever had, but it's a pretty darn good one. Now, why this is a definitive 5+ star place is because of their old fashioned. It is the best old fashioned I've ever had. I tend to not order an old fashioned in most places because for the same price you pay here, you get bottom to middle tier liquor that burns your gut and leaves you saying ""no más."" This old fashioned was impeccable. Absolutely perfect. Goes down real smooth. Even the stupid cherry garnish was perfect. The right amount of sweetness, a perfumey vanilla quality, no artificial bright red color and HFCS. I watched the bartender intently as he spritzed the orange zest over the drink before dropping it in. Beautiful. Just beautiful. It's like he tenderly made love to my drink and when she woke up he had a lovely hot breakfast waiting for her. I ended up ordering two and cut myself short because I had another (not as impressive) bar to visit. Thank you Au Cheval for showing me what a proper Old Fashioned is about."
"We finally made it in! After being discouraged by the waiting list for tables a few times, we made it to Au Cheval. After waiting for about an hour for a table to open up, I noticed that Au Cheval is a very dimly lit place. It's a lot like their other restaurants GSSM, High Five Ramen, and Bavette's to name a few. I just found it a little heard to look at my food and the menu. Which can pose a problem. So I am typical and we ordered the Beef Bone Marrow, Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Gravy, Double cheeseburger with thick cut bacon and a perfectly fried egg. Since I was not partaking in their cocktails, I cannot comment on those. It looked like they were really putting effort in their cocktails because they sure did look amazing. The bone marrow was good and came with Texas style toast points and Jam. I am not sure what kind of jam it is but it is some sort of wonderful. The jam, toast and buttery gelatinous bone marrow just made the most harmonious pairing. I realize how hard it is to make bone marrow. You have to slice the bone in half and PERFECTLY roast the marrow, too much and the marrow will cook out and too little it will taste disgusting. The geniuses  at Au Cheval have perfected this fine art and they deserve a round of applause. Arguably, many people say that Au Cheval has the best burger in Chicago. I am not going to outright say that since it is such a heated debate. On my personal list of favorite burgers though, I would say that Au Cheval is top 3 on my list. The Double Cheese Burger with thick cut bacon and perfectly sunny side up egg. I feel like the thick cut bacon made it too salty but otherwise it was a perfect burger. I mean it wasn't jumbled up with a bunch of different flavors and less is more. They really let the burger meat sing on its own. High Quality Meat, bun, fixins, egg, that's it. The egg gave the burger all the dimension in flavor and texture it needs. The Garlic Mashed potatoes with gravy is out of this freaking world man. With tiny bits of the roasted garlics and a looser type of gravy. Whatever you are going to get at Au Cheval, get it, but always, ALWAYS, get that garlic mashed potatoes and gravy. That stuff stole my heart and I have been thinking of those dang mashed potatoes since I left that place. Our server was really cool and attentive even though the place was slammed. They were playing some pretty awesome old school hip-hop. Prices aren't too shabby for the Randolph Restaurant Hub and a perfect place to wind down after work. So Au Cheval wins in my book and I plan to return every chance I can. I hear their brunch is something we must try next."
"I've dined at Au Cheval several times plus I've referred out of towners for one of the best burgers in town. The burgers, fries with house made aioli and the fried chicken are awesome. Great menu and drinks. The place is very small, so seating is limited. The wait is always incredibly insane, at least an hour during dinner time. I have been for lunch and we waited about 20 minutes to be seated. With friends and a cocktail or two it is worth the wait."
"I've been meaning to come here with a friend, but didn't know much about the place so it wasn't too hyped up in my mind. When I arrived, we ordered Bloody Marys which were super tasty. Spicy, flavorful, and topped with sport peppers, pickles, and olives. Definitely hit the spot on a Sunday afternoon.My friend highly recommended the chopped chicken liver, salted butter, and toast. I'm usually down to try anything, so I thought what the hell. HOLY. SHIT. You guys, this may have been the greatest thing I've ever put in my pie hole. I was actually a little flabbergasted at first, that something like that could taste so good. I can honestly say it's one of the best things, if not THE best thing, that I've ever eaten in a restaurant. The chicken liver is roughly chopped, mixed with dill, and extremely rich and flavorful. The salted butter is heavenly, and the toast is perfectly crunchy and extra thick. Yeah, just slathering the golden toast with that fresh, creamy, salty butter and topping it with a spoonful of chicken liver...sorry, I think I hear angels singing. Anyway, I also ordered the cheeseburger with bacon, and a side of fries. Cheeseburger is amazing and I can see why it was just named the best burger in America. High quality beef, juicy, greasy, topped with plentiful cheese, some sort of magic mayo, and thick, THICK cut bacon, all contained in a soft, perfect bun. Fries were also delicious and came with a fantastic garlic aioli. Highly recommend, and bring your appetite."
"Alright, so if you're reading this review you've probably heard something about Au Cheval. If you've read any of the other reviews here, you also know there is one universal truth about Au Cheval - it is delicious, but sometimes you really have to wait for it. But that's what I'm here to help with.Strategies for quick seating at AC:Go for lunch on a weekday. The location isn't ideal if you don't live or work near west loop, but if you can get here for an early lunch it is worth it to not have to wait. The doors open at 11 and on my last visit, I was there at 11:15 and was still able to be immediately seated at 11:30 when my friend arrived. I would say until 11:50 there were people being seated immediately. After that, I'd say the wait probably jumps to 30 minutes at noon and, for lunch, probably tops out at an hour.Go for an early dinner. Their hours are technically 11 am - 1 am, but the kitchen closes from 3-5pm. I reckon you can sit in here and drink still or something from 3-5 pm, but it really clears out so if you're there right around 5, you can also be seated quickly.Are you still with me? Good. We're almost done...SIT AT THE BAR!!! This, above all else, is my number one recommendation for dining at Au Cheval. The work of the kitchen staff is nothing short of poetry in motion. They work together as a well oiled machine and watching the burgers (more on those in a minute) being prepared is like magic. Remember being a kid and seeing a Cabbage Patch Kid* being born or a Build-A-Bear being stuffed? This is the adult version.The burger: this burger is without a doubt the best thing I've ever eaten. Not best burger. Best anything. We'll see if that ever changes but I'm not sure it will. The single burger comes with two patties - don't make the mistake of getting a double. Get the bacon. It's two, 1/4 inch thick, perfectly sliced pieces of deliciousness. And if you're really feeling up to it, the egg is a great topper.The fries: the regular fries come in a paper cone with a garlic aioli to dip them in and are delicious. If you have a huge appetite, or a group, splurge and get the crispy fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli & fried farm egg. (Under the 'with eggs' section of the menu.)Lastly, I've also had the General Jane's Honey-Fried Chicken with Chili, Sesame Seeds & Cilantro. This dish is also delicious but I can't in good conscience recommend ordering anything other than the burger for yourself. Your best bet for veering away from the burger is to get a group and all get a burger and then share another entree. But friends don't let friends not get the burger at Au Cheval.*What, you've never been to Cleveland, GA to visit Babyland General Hospital to see a CPK being born? Add it to the bucket list. Right up there below 'Getting the burger at Au Cheval.'"
I've been living in the US for the last 3 years (just moved from NYC) and this is by far the best burger I had in this country! Get it with fried egg. Get it with bacon. Enjoy!
"The hype is real. Initially we weren't that excited, but it was recommended by a friend so we decided to give it a shot. We waited 2.5 hours to get a table, but it was so worth it. We ordered the single cheeseburger, which actually has two patties. We added the egg and bacon. I normally don't like runny egg, but it was the best burger I've ever had! Everything just came together so deliciously!"
"Holy hell.  This is easily the second best burger I've had in my life.  I promise to update this if this changes.  Kuma's sucks compared to this (and kinda sucks in general, whoops).  Seriously.  That won't change.Don't come here on a weekend.  Or at night.  A weekday at lunch has a 45 minute wait (might quote you 1:15).  I've never ever had another place quote me a 4 hour wait in my life.I came here with a friend having seen and heard about the burgers they have.  See, I'm on a quest.  A burger quest.  It will take a couple years, but I plan to have all of the best burgers in the area.  Pretzel buns are an abomination btw.  Now the burgers they serve are smash-burger style.  This is not a bad style and is refreshing when compared to other places that attempt to produce the most massive burger they can fit between two pieces of bread (hence the birth of the extremely dense pretzel bun).  The smashburger produces lots of browning, yet they do well to not overcook the small patty.  Their burger is automatically a double when your order a single and a triple when you order a double.  My reccommendation is to order a single with bacon and egg.  The bacon is very thick.  It's essentially fatty ham, but very tasty and almost a third patty.  The egg is consistently the most perfectly soft fried egg I've ever seen or eaten.  Put it all together and you have gooey delicious egg running over your perfectly cooked bacon and beef and cheese.  I don't like pickles on burgers, but these guys have it perfected.Oh, if you somehow find time to eat something else grab an order of fires.  They are excellent.Now, people tell me the other food is good and I should try it and escape my burger heaven.  I believe them, because this place is awesome, but why have the 2nd best dish on the menu?"
"Au Chval makes me feel that if I never set foot in their restaurant again, they wouldn't care. Despite the amazing food, I choose not to patron a restaurant that does not value my business. Au Cheval makes one of the best burgers in the city, if not the country. HOWEVER, I decided to give them a low rating because of the service and the price.Service: They do not take reservations and the wait time (2-4 hours) is absurd. The hosts and hostesses are unapologetic when they inform potential customers of the wait time and seem ungrateful of their extraordinary success. Waiters and waitresses are polite and attentive, but do no make up for the rest of the service experience.Price: They lose their price on one menu item: French Fries. A burger already costs $10.95, and despite its amazing quality, it is served a la carte. That alone would not bother me, but I'm of the belief that a burger should always come with fries and, if for some reason they don't, charging $5.95 for a side of fries is insulting.Atmosphere: Not a place for intimate conversation, or for that matter any conversation. The later it gets the more they dim the lights and turn up the music. I had trouble hearing the waiter or the people I was eating with. I felt like I was in a nightclub. I strained to hear and be heard, and felt a sense of relief when I finally stepped out into the relative quiet of W Randolph St (not that quiet of a street).Food: Incredible. Throw a dart at the menu and you can't go wrong.Drinks: A solid beer list that's not overwhelming. I'm not familiar with their cocktails.Food: 5 StarsDrinks: 4 StarsAtmosphere: 2 StarsService: 1 StarPrice: 1 Star"
"I was a little underwhelmed based upon hearing that this is the best burger in Chicago.  Do not get me wrong it was really good but not even close to my top burger on my list.  My brother said we went on an off day, as it was lunch time.  The burger was still juicy just not incredible tasting.  The cheese on it was excellent, and the bacon was really good.  Next time I am going to request no sauce it was a tad sweet for me.  The fries were really good and the garlic sauce it came with as killer good!  This is a neat experience if you sit at the counter because you can watch them cook the burgers and serve them.  Next time I will go at dinner time and get egg on my burger, and if the burger is better next time I will surely update my review, but for now, it is no top 10 for me, but still good."
"The search for my favorite cheeseburger in Chi is finally over.  It was everything I expected and more.  Definitely worth the wait - luckily, we went early (5:15pm) on a Thursday night, so we only ended up waiting for 45 minutes for 2 seats at the bar directly facing the kitchen.  I loved watching the chefs at work - a well oiled machine to a great soundtrack of rock music!  You could literally reach out and pick off the fries being measured out into the serving containers.We went straight for business with two single cheeseburgers.  Both of us tried it with the fried egg and I added the thick cut pepper bacon just to try it once.  I usually don't like runny egg on my burgers, but it was the most glorious (and messy) addition that completed the burger.  The bacon was nice and peppery, but pretty thick, almost half as thick as one of the patties.  A single comes with two patties and a double with three patties.  They were so juicy and perfect and stand alone without anything else dressing them up.  I also liked how there weren't any usual condiments like lettuce, tomato, or onions - those are distractions and not necessary, but usually get soggy and gross mixed with the hot meat and cheese.  The pickles and sauce were just enough +/- the egg and +/- bacon.  The size of the patties were also manageable - yes you do have to use a knife to cut it in half, but you can still hold each half with your hands comfortably.  We also split a side fries - the serving is perfect for two people.  They were hot, crunchy, salted just right, and came with a great side of garlic aioli.  For dessert, they had a selection of ice creams, but I came here not only for the burgers, but for the Mille-Feuille, aka Napolean.  I've been fantasizing about it ever since we tried it here the previous visit (when we just came for desserts and drinks late night).  It was exactly how I remembered it, three crispy layers of puff pastry filled with cream in between and dusted with confectioner's sugar on top. It comes with a side of hot fudge to pour over it.  I devoured it all despite feeling the hamburger coma kicking in already.    Being pregnant I can't comment on their drinks and cocktails, although Hubby thoroughly enjoyed his Old Fashioned.  I thoroughly enjoyed their root beer on tap.  It was a perfect dinner and dessert, what's not to love about this place?"
"I had higher expectations but the burger was not all that everyone says it was. Smashed potatoes were ok also not like 4 or 5 star worthy. Also if I wasn't so hungry, I may not complain as much, but there was a 20 minute delay between items. I understand it's a busy place but seriously? Oh well. Maybe I'll try it again sometime but not for awhile. There are too many other new places in Chicago that I would go to before coming back."
"There was a time in my life when I thought there wasn't such a thing as too much head... Then I ordered the Jolly Pumpkin at Au Cheval, and I guess, attitudes change... Apparently there was a problem with the CO2. Life goes on. All kidding aside this place is fantastic. Order everything. Over multiple visits. Happy eating :) Thank you beautiful bartender who suffered my JP order (that foam was never going to settle), you are a star among champions."
"Au GOOD GOD Au Cheval was AMAZING!  If I had to wait the 2 1/2 hr standard wait time it would have been totally worth it after the meal I had.  Our waitress was awesome BTW but I forgot her name so can't give her the shoutout she deserves :( Sorry! We ordered the ham and cheese fondue with toast, the garlic aiolic fries with egg, the burger with the $9.00 bacon (which was worth it) and the Pork Porterhouse that we all shared family style.  Tip-they only have 2 porterhouses a day and you can call and reserve it...YOU HAVE TO TRY IT! It's so juicy and covered in this sweet apple foie gras glaze that is unbelievable! As soon as we ordered I smelled something delicious cooking because it's an open kitchen and I was hoping it was the porterhouse, if not I had to order whatever that amazing smell was. So asked...and sure enough, it was the porterhouse! YAY! It was my favorite dish of the night and could not stop eating it :PThe burger, which I heard is the best, really did live up to the hype! And I'm not a big fan of burgers but really glad I tried it because I almost wanted to eat the whole thing! The thick bacon really is worth the $9 extra charge...TRUST ME! Oh and also an egg...can't forget about the egg! Egg makes everything better :)The ham and cheese fondue with egg and bread was also delicious and the bread has crack in it because I kept eating it.  And the garlic aioli fries with egg was also fabulous!  So everything about this place was on point! The service was impeccable, the food was mind blowing and the ambiance is fun with an open kitchen.  The only thing I could do without is the wait time which is what makes me think twice about going back so soon :( But seriously Au Cheval... BRAVO!!!"
"Great burger, but a little too salty and greasy for my taste.  Maybe it was this one time.  I will go back again to give you my second impression. Love the atmosphere! Dim lighting, great music, and a nice romantic, intimate feel to the place.  Would be a great place to take a date, but they don't take reservations at the moment not do I think they ever will."
"This place was good, but my tummy can't handle the grease. :( Cute atmosphere. Long crazy waits. Fries are amazing. The wings were good."
"No wait for lunch on Tuesday when it first opens. The bread and butter pickles should be shared. There's a lot of it! The bone marrow and beef cheek marmalade was phenomenal. The bone marrow is SO much better than The Purple Pig's. I had the entire plate to myself. I do not regret it, but I think it should also be a shared dish. It was a bit heavy to eat myself. My friend had the single burger but it came with two patties anyway. I had a bit of it, and it might be the best bite of burger I've had. I hear there's usually a 2-hour wait; I think it's worth it!"
"Finally able to get in here and see what the hype is about and this place delivered. I ordered the single, which is really a double, with and egg and bacon. Omg it was amazing. The bacon and the egg melded perfectly with the burger which was cooked to a perfect medium rare and not well done. Seriously, whoever orders beef well done needs to get their beef privileges revoked. But back to be burger, it came with a little aioli and diced onions on top which was a good balance along with everything else on the burger. We also ordered the duck heart hash for the table and that was also amazing. The gravy was nice and rich and the hash was so crispy and potato-y. Seriously though, from now on when I want a burger I'm going down to au cheval and even if I have to wait I'll do it."
"Went on a snowy Wednesday night around 5:30pm and waited an hour. I can safely say Au Cheval is worth the hype, and that this is the best no-frills burger I have ever experienced. Got the double (really a triple) cheeseburger with bacon, no egg. The patties are thin, griddled, unmistakably high-quality beef. The extra thick cut, maple-braised peppered bacon is the best I've had in a long time, and in my opinion really completes the burger. Not even 10 minutes after finishing that burger, I was ready to eat another (seriously.)"
"Best burger I've ever had. Literally. You must go, but my suggestion is to go early, before your hungry, to put your name down. The wait will most likely be about 2 hours no matter what day of the week. Grab a drink from another nearby place and eagerly await the text letting you know your table is ready. It's worth the wait, trust me. Also, be aware their tables only seat up to 4 people comfortably! ENJOY!"
"Man that burger is delicious. I got the single with egg and bacon which complimented each other perfectly. The meat crumbled, the egg yolk was runny, and the bacon was smoky and not too salty. The frites were also very good. It got pretty messy eating the burger but it was probably because of the egg. I'm not really blown away by burgers so I can't say it was the best burger I've had in my life. The only real downfall is the wait time which I'm used to being from the NYC metro area."
"Speakeasy gastro-diner. Feels like Prohibition the moment you walk in - from the long wraparound counter bar, to tucked booths, dim lighting and dark walls. Loved everything we ordered:- Roasted marrow bones with a generous side of beef cheek marmalade: Go big or go home. This is the Zeus of all marrow bones, nothing subtle about Au Cheval's dish. Best heart attack I've ever had. Served with Texas toast, b/c why be subtle?- Crispy fries with mornay, garlic aioli, fried egg: Carb-tastic glory, my tastebuds rejoiceth. Garlic aioli is yum, pass on the mornay- Trumpet mushroom, kale, morel jack cheese omelette: Friend devoured this. Savory goodness- Raw salad (avoiding an immediate ER visit): Super fresh thinly sliced root vegetables, fennel, apple, radishes, piled crazy high. Serving size for 2 comfortably, 3 if just tastingHad a great server who knew his food and drink. Avoid peak time as wait can get formidable. Restaurant is small, so smaller parties are your best bet. Strongly recommend."
"When people  say   ""best burger"" or  ""best pizza""  or  best whatever - it's a bit based on personal taste. However - this place delivers  a pretty  great $9-10 burger!  And glad to see they are  opening a second location - Small Cheval! Even if it's just for summer. 1732 N. Milwaukee Ave"
Best burger I've ever had. Great beer selection as well. Give it a whirl nut be prepared to wait for a table.
"Love their brunch food, especially their chilaquiles."
Yes it's delicious but trying hard to be esoteric and expensive doesn't work for this middle aged man.
"I have been here a couple of times celebrating birthdays. There's no reservation so come early and wait in line if you have a schedule to keep:)Definitely, their burger is a huge draw. The fries with the garlic aioli are great too. Tried the fried bologna sandwich and thought it was really salty. What I loved the most was the Jone's blueberry muffin. Ridiculously amazing. Just try it!"
"Read the fine print: kitchen closes (wtf) from 3-5.  Got there at 3:45 and went to Bar Sienna for drinks.  Would have waited @ Au, but I wanted to talk to my friend and Au thinks it's cool to have deafening music.Had the double cheeseburger+bacon+egg, the fried bologna and fries.  I know their burgers are highly rated, but I prefer Shake Shack's flavor (and value).  The bologna was excellent and the fries were really good.  Good selection of draft beers.Service was silly.  We all sat at our tables like lemmings waiting for 5 o'clock, the waitstaff then goes to each table, collects the orders, disappears into the kitchen and floods them with demand.  Out pops hamburgers.  But not from 3-5."
Fried bologna sandwich.... SUPURB. I could eat it everyday. Don't go here if you want a salad and no flavor.. go here to INDULGE and enjoy it!!!
"This burger is amazing, it is so ridiculously rich and satisfying.  Best Burger Ever? I do not agree, however excellent in its own way.  Some acidity would go a long way in completing this masterpiece, but that is one minor complaint in a very well crafted burger.  The Fries with the Egg is too much on top of this burger, just get the regular fries because once again they are so rich with that Garlic Aioli, and the Mornay.  We waited 30 minutes before they opened, which I recommend as a good time as we were 16th in line.  The anticipation and excitement in the line was fun."
"Best burger ever.  I've traveled high and low, and it does not get any better than this.  And not to mention.... Their music selection is really good."
Anyone who doesn't like their burger here is wrong.  The only burger that I've eaten is from Sixteen at the Trump and that's $44.  It really doesn't get any better than the burger from Au Cheval.
"This place is awesome in many ways. First, it's the BEST Burger I've ever had, and I've been to just about every place awarded the title ""Best Burger"" including the famous Holeman and Finch restaurant in Atlanta. The thick bacon and perfectly fried egg top off delicious parties of beef. Just remember, a single is actually a double and a double is a triple! Second, the atmosphere is just my style- neighborhood bar feel with fun music. The cooks get into the music as they work their magic on the grill. Finally, $3 Tall Boys and $3 Bourbon shots? Yes please. This may be my favorite spot in ChiTown."
"Place had really great food. Only bad were three things. 1st this is probably the worst lighting I've ever been in I went at midnight. Those dumbass candles don't do shit. They might as well turn off the lights and everyone sit in complete darkness. 2nd, the fried chicken was $18 (that shit is not worth $18 dollars) it's good for about $7-$10 but not freaking $18. 3rd they got my order wrong. But it wasn't the waitress fault it was the kitchen. But besides that everything was great. Burgers were great!!!"
"A pub, not a french restaurant that serves horse. This is an important distinction because there are two restaurants on the block with Goat in their name and that's one of the things they serve.How do you say best burger ever, when you've had so many great burgers? Well, if this isn't the best, it's in the team photo.We met my son Ian and his friend Kendall there for dinner. (their idea... good job!) Being a bunch of smartypants we figured that we would show up right when the kitchen opened at 5pm, unfortunately other people were smartypantsier and got seated before the kitchen opened, so we had to wait for about an hour for those people to finish their meal. An hour around there is no big deal, there is plenty to do.The staff is friendly, professional and helpful. They texted us when they were ready for us, got us some libations while the table was being prepared and then seated us. The waitress tried to hook us with the fish special (no one bit on that) we asked some questions about the burgers, she gave us a few a minutes to contemplate, conspire and then came back to take our orders.Normally I would get the double burger, it's in my DNA to go big.. but tonight I wanted Chili too.. my son Ian ordered the double (only $2 extra) so it must be in his DNA too. Imagine that?The single is a double anyway, so a double is a quadruple and when you add some bacon and eggs to the sandwich you have a truly epic, messy burger.But my single was as much as I wanted after eating the chili too, Lisa got the regular burger and took half home. We shared an order of fries, we would have eaten more if they were on the table, but we weren't compelled to order another.Kendall decided to be different, she got the Fried Bologna sandwich and if I didn't want the burger so bad.. I might have been jealous. This isn't your typical fried bologna sandwich... it doesn't have a first name that is O - S - C - A - R. this is sliced thin and piled high, not super baloney-ee. I think she wished she had gotten a burger (but I might just be projecting)A note for those people that don't like mayo.. we didn't see it on the menu, but mayo just comes on the sandwiches.... no biggie for me, but I am not an island.. and this had an effect on one of us.The chili. The chili is delicious, great meaty consistency and the right amount of beans.. it comes with Frito's corn chips on it.. and that is an excellent combination!This is not a cheap burger place, the burger (al a carte) starts at 10.95 and then you add the extras like the egg and bacon (not slices.. a slab!) But it's worth it."
"This is a crazy popular restaurant in the West Loop. They don't take reservation and it's pretty small inside. I showed up 20 minutes before they open in hopes we will get seated when they open at 11am on Saturday. When I got there, there was already a line circling the corner of au cheval! There were about 7 groups ahead of me and the line just kept forming until it opened. There were 5 of us but 3 of them didn't show up on time; their policy is that everyone needs to be there in order to get seated. Since my group weren't all there, we were placed on the wait list. There was a swarm of people who just kept storming in. My friends all showed up about 5-10 minutes after 11..we told the host and our wait time just went up to 1 hour wait. Ouch! So we waited... What's nice is that you can order drinks. While you're waiting for a table. A friend ordered a glass of OJ..$4 each and it wasn't a big glass. Another friend ordered their cappcaccino or some kind of coffee- $3.50. Pretty pricey but was tasty.Onto the food.. We all ordered the single cheeseburger with 2 sides of the regular fries. Single cheeseburger = 2 patties! The fries were decent. I had my burger without the bun but with hash brown, it's not listed on the menu but you can make a special request for it. There's an up charge of $4.95 for the hash brown. I also asked for a fried egg on top which was an additional $2. You pretty much pay for the patty and everything you want to add extra is a la carte. I thought the burger was ok. I'm generally not a burger person. The addition of the bash was just ok..a little too crispy for my liking. The other friends who ordered their normal cheeseburger enjoyed it. Overall this is a decent place. Pretty pricy for burger and super long wait! If you don't want to wait hours to be seated, make sure you arrive at least 15 min before they open and ensure your group is on time to get seated. Once you get there after it open the wait time starts at 1 hour. Parking is a little difficult since its on Randolph (aka restaurant row). My stomach also did not feel well later that evening. My stomach was hurting and I had the runs. Another friend had the runs too. For me I think my stomach wasn't used to the grease. Didn't eat anything the rest of the day. My other friends were ok though."
"Au Cheval put eating burgers on to a whole New Level. The debate will go on for centuries as to who has the best burgers in Chicago. Kumas? Lockdown? Au Cheval? Fatsos? Paramount Room? And many others. While I can not with absolute confidence say Au Cheval is the best it is near the top and may be the best. I ordered the double cheeseburger (3 patties) with bacon and a fried egg. If the burger itself is considered the best by many shouldnt it be even better with bacon and a fried egg? Despite all this heavenly goodness the element that stuck out most to me was the actual beef patties. It just melts in your mouth! Oh, and how about that bacon its like an inch thick, well not really but its insanely thick.The one area that puts Au Cheval over the top for me is not so much the burger but the experience eating it. I have never enjoyed eating a burger as much as this. After being seated at one of the counter stools I realized I was practically sitting right on top of the cooks. All the action was right in front of me. When its busy I do not know how they do it. 4-6 cooks organizing buns, grilling beef patties, simmering soup, adding toppings, cleaning, testing ingredients, etc. My feeling was like that of an artist who can paint something so detailed and delicate in such a short period of time, you can only ask "" how the f*ck you do that"". Yet when your burger is served its perfect as if one of them spent hours carefully crafting your masterpiece of a burger. In addition to the kitchen the whole environment is loud, boisterous, in your face, fast-paced organized chaos and I absolutely enjoyed the show! Not the place for your quiet, romantic valentines date.To have experienced the performance of all these well-trained professionals orchestrate the making of your double cheeseburger, or Bone Marrow, or Matzo Ball Soup etc all the while having one of the best burgers ever is an amazing experience. This place needs to be on your hitlist if you live in Chicago or are visiting."
"Yes sir, may I please have another! Place was legit. Randomly heard of this place by suggestion of buddy and decided to check it out one day. We got there around four, which is right when they stop serving food and prepping for the dinner rush. Which is an amazingly good idea for the staff to get ready. Just be prepared for it, if you actually want to dine in. Get there early and having a beer is a good bet. I had the Shake American Porter by Boulder Brewing. It's deep chocolate tones and creamy, frothy head, made me feel like I was drinking an ice cream parlor! However, the staff said we could place dinner orders at 4:30, but didn't actually take the orders till 5. That's the only mark down on the place for me! The staff was cool, and lets us try some of the bacon glaze, before our meal arrived. I had the single patty burger with foie gras. The flavor and quality was bursting from the burger. The juiciness of the foie gras only added to the complexity of the burger. Since I see myself as a baconator,(someone who quite enjoys bacon) I had to try the bacon. The host recommended it on the side, which was totally the right call. This isn't your grandpa Jimmy's bacon, that's for sure. The bacon was a super slab, in an amazing cherry caramel glaze. The bacon was a bit fleshy, depending on how you like your bacon cooked, but still so fire. Overall, I give four stars for the quality, ambience, and luxury, but Kumas Corner is still my number one! Bomb burger from Au Cheval 0. My stomach 10."
I'll make this review simple. It's the best burger I have ever had. Well worth the wait.
"My word, this place has so much hype. One would literally think they were eating the best food in Chicago & certainly the best hamburger you have ever eaten. It is really good, don't get me wrong, it is also expensive for what you get (which is upscale/casual food) and it certainly is not worth the wait. I felt like I was there for the decor and the scene and the food was secondary.  As someone who goes to restaurants to eat great food, I was underwhelmed. I will wait in a line on the street for great food, this place was not worth the wait, and even if there is no wait, not worth the price."
"""You know why I'm here""-Marshawn LynchIt's all about the burger! My niece has worked here for a little over a year, and kept telling me I should come to her restaurant. Being a recent western burb transplant, going back to the city was far down my list with the preponderance of restaurants I have yet to visit in my own back yard. I have read rave review after review about the burger here, and never connected the dots as this being the place my niece works. Once I realized this was the place, it skyrocketed towards the top of things to do when I make my way into the city. So, I needed something to do while I take my daughter & friend to Drakes concert at the United Center. Burger time! Went to Au Cheval. Very hipster scene. Seen a guy with capri pants & sandals, smh. But lively none the less.So I'm seated at the bar across from the grill, and next to prep area. All I could see were burgers flying everywhere! Some with this pork belly style bacon, others sans it; some singles, some doubles, even triples. And then they put a sunny side up egg on top!So trying to be in a health kick, no way I can eat this thing with a heavy dose of veggies. So I order the root veggie salad. It came out looking extremely decadent, but even more so delicious! And the goat cheese really set it off! I couldn't even finish it!On to the Burger.I got the double. Triple seemed too much, single not enough for full effect. I also get a side of the hash browns.....SOOOO GOOD! I couldn't stop eating them! But the burger is something ungodly; it's so good it must be wrong! You put it together & squeeze it to break the egg yolk, and it runs all down the sides of the burger! This was insanely good! I now understand all the hype. It's perfectly executed gooey goodness.Loved the ambiance. They play music on an actual reel-to-reel! Was VERY impressed with their hip hop selections on this Friday night. It was hard to leave. Loved this place!"
"So glad that Au Cheval was the latest stop on my quest to try all of the Hogsalt establishments. My sisters and I popped in for dinner last week and had a truly incredible meal that was worth the wait. While you're waiting here the waitresses are kind enough to pop around and take drinks orders for those waiting who are not seated at the bar. It gets pretty crowded because it's not a huge place but a drink while you wait definitely makes it more manageable. When we got seated we decided to a few things to get a sense of what they had to offer. We went with General Jane's Chicken, two Single Cheeseburgers one with bacon and egg, and the Crispy Fries. It was a TON of food and everything was outstanding. The cheeseburger was literally to die for and probably one of the best I've ever had. Their homemade pickles are the real deal and totally make the burger. The fries and chicken we were also equally great. The only real downside to our meal was that after we were served our waitress disappeared for about thirty minutes. We were ready to get the check and had to wait around for quite sometime and it was kind of annoying. However, it's not enough to keep me from coming back. Their burgers are worth the wait and the trip!"
"Well deserved to be the #1 in the nation for burgers!We had the single 1/2# it has 2 patties,and you gotta order it with the BACon and yes EGG!!! And the Fries!!!Next will try the chix wings!Few things they need to improved on though,more dining space,if they do this?,it'll be less wait,much less than 2 Hours!and they need to have hi chairs to,but you can get away by having a booth, so no worries .But yes it tasted like the #1 burger!""you will never look at the burger the same way again"" lol"
"Eh.Wait:  Stopped at around 11:40 am on a Thursday put put my name in for a party of 4.  Told wait was 90 minutes to 2 hours.  Didn't believe it.  40 minutes later got a text that table was about ready.  Should have been suspicious then of their math skills.Ambiance:  As expected, like a small cramped bar.  Mediocre music cranked up way too loud.Service:  Efficient is the best I can say.  Told server this was our first time.  She didn't offer any explanations unless asked.  Menu has no descriptions.  3 of us ordered doubles, 1 ordered a single.  To our surprise, turns out doubles have 3 patties, singles have 2.  Huh?  Would have hoped the server might have explained that.  Table next to ours was just as confused by this place's math.  Only cheese is American.  Really?  Bacon was undercooked, not crispy.  Hash browns were virtually inedible; greasy and way over salted.  Should have sent them back.  Fries were a small portion for the price; also limp and greasy but at least not salted to death.  Burgers were ok, but not deserving of all the buzz.  No need to return.  There are better burger places all over the city."
"Definitely NOT the 'best burger in America.' It's actually nowhere close. The best burger in America is the black label burger at minetta tavern and the runner up is the burger at nomad NYC. The best burger should be medium rare and come with no bells and whistles. Minetta & Nomad do not even use cheese to distract u from the delicious meat, they also assume medium rare. Here at au chevel they cook 2 thin patties medium. What makes me the most angry is that the Patties are frozen Sysco patties and covered with 2 slices of Kraft cheese. Yes, a Kraft single. One slice ontop and one inbetween the thin ass patties. Then, they cover it with djionaise which is mayo and mustard, and pickles. I swear it tastes exactly like McDonald's, how does this get rated 'best burger?' I would give it 'highest advertised.' No wonder it's so dark in there they don't want u to actually see the food."
"Yum. We arrived at 10am on Sunday, and waited an hour for two. It was delicious, and worth the wait- order a Bloody Mary and you will be very happy with the bread and butter pickles."
"I have written nothing but Five Star reviews for all of Brendan Sodikoff's restaurants -- I even got his Deli.  My favorite is Au Cheval, which is 3 blocks away from home.  At 60 I can't spend hours waiting in line for food that is likely to kill me so I always stand in line to wait for its opening.  It killed me when lunch service meant I couldn't line up at 5 pm -- I am 60 after all -- because the patrons could hold their tables by drinking for two hours.  Today I waited 25 minutes just like every one else.  My turn comes for my party of one.  There are tables available, but they show me to the bar.  I love you Brendan but that lacks class."
"Without a doubt worth the wait. Put your name in, go grab a beer (or three) at Haymarket or Lone Wolf, and then enjoy the crown jewel of Chicago that is the Au Cheval burger."

"With the exception of the crazy wait time, this was a REALLY delicious experience! The single cheeseburger with bacon and eggs was seriously the best burger I have had. Do it the right way by having it just like they have it in the menu. I want try the gluten free version because the hash brown patties look amazing! Fries with an egg were also very good!"
"We three all ordered the single cheeseburger. Two of us elected to add a fried egg, while the third, and most adventurous of the clan, added a fried egg and thick cut bacon #merica. The first few bites were all followed by complete silence and expressions that can only be characterized as a combination of ecstasy, shock, and then complete surrender to the symphony of deliciousness invading our mouths.The following are lines uttered from our poorly mannered, food filled mouths as we ate:1. Now that gay marriage has been legalized, how long do you think it will take for they allow me to marry this burger.2. I want to marry this burger and have burger babies with it . . . then eat those burger babiesWhile looking at the burger in admiration and lust: 3. I love you.4. I want to shrink myself and live inside this burger.Bottom line: The burgers are unreasonably delicious, the service is fantastic, and the selection of libations leaves little to be desired."
"""I'm all about that bacon, 'bout that bacon, no burger...""  I can't see how their cheeseburger is this famous without it!  Without the bacon, the burger is good but not great.  Yep, I just said that.  So don't forget to get the bacon!Now for the long version of my review...Wait time: 1 hour, at 5:06 PM on a Friday night.  We walked in, and there was already a line to put our name down.  Oddly, the whole restaurant was packed already, and there were people halfway done eating their burgers!  I thought this place opens at 5 PM??  There be some shady bidniz going on.  We went to a bar across the street to kill some time, and sure enough, we got a text about an hour later stating that our table will be ready next.Good lighting: If you're here at night and get seated at a booth, the overhead lighting is perfect for your Instagram pix!Food:Chopped salad - Comes with 2 pieces of their thick-cut bacon.  It's smoky, a little sweet, and incredibly decadent.  *happy wiggle*  Beware that although dill is scattered throughout, the flavor is not at all overwhelming.Crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy (and shredded duck meat) - Comfort.  Food.  Not super gamey.  It was definitely too much for 2 people to share and eat all the other stuff we ordered, but we did it anyway because YOLO.  Single cheeseburger (2 patties) - Satisfying.  The patties taste like & remind me of Shake Shack minus the crispy edges, but otherwise rather plain compared to my husband's burger (see below).Double cheeseburger (3 patties) - The fried egg and 2 slices of bacon cost extra.  The fried egg didn't really do anything for me.  Let's be honest: the egg is only for food porn because you can't taste it through all the other flavors.  Also, I think 3 patties is overkill with an egg and the super phat bacon.  I mean, it gets really messy, says my husband's hand which got coated in grease like paraffin wax.  Seriously, his whole hand was glistening that it was distracting.Side of fries, which comes with garlic aioli - This is a must!  Perfect size for two people.Total bill was just under $60 without drinks and before tip.  The next time I come back for the burger, I'm getting the single with bacon.  Or I'll just go to Shake Shack..."
"NOW I know why this place had a damn line and it wasn't even 11:30 am. Au Cheval's ""single"" burger has 2 super tender, flavorful beef patties that have just the right mix of salt, pepper, cheese and some special creamy sauce that is like a Ranch dressing surrounded by its own red, velvet ropes.Walked through the door around 11:11am and they were bumpin' Shuggie Otis' ""Aht Uh Mi Hed"", so this is already heab'n. 7 miles up.Are they're making entire cheeseburger batches instead of to order? Not that you could ever tell by the taste and quality, but they were quick to get it to table. I had mine within 5 minutes of sitting at the bar and it was the best casual burger I've had since the 1970's. But from a high end perspective, i still appreciate the Wagyu that The Capital Grille serves, but they have some strong competition breathing down their necks.The eating space is very limited but posh. I love all of the stainless steel kitchen action behind the bar and the red wine colored stylish booths by the window.And the punky, bespectacled, nice young lady who greets you at the door could easily fit in an early 80's Basquiat and Warhol documentary... and I just wish I could tag along."
"Everything with an egg.  We started with the fries topped with an egg and a side of this dipping sauce and garlic aioli.  MUST GET.  The fries were fresh, crispy on the outside and light on the inside.I ordered a burger with egg and it did not disappoint.  Anything with egg is delicious! My friend ordered the bacon on the side and OMG.  Thick slabs of meat, candy covered with this sweet glaze.  It was so addicting I had to control myself. We finished the meal with this super amazing, wonderful, heavenly, melt in your mouth French custard for dessert.  The custard was light, the croissant flaky and buttery.  Goodness, it's worth every calorie ;)All the food was worth the hour wait, but the dessert would have really been worth it on its own!"
"Au Cheval's a diner?! Yep! There are 10-12 tables in the back, but the front is all kitchen counter and booths. Booths are large enough to fit the entire SNL ""Ditka vs hurricane"" cast, so snag one and sink in, winter's fangs fading amid the soft cushions and tantalizing scent from the open kitchen.Dim-glowing candles are reflected in the large glass windows that protect you from the horror outside. Lounge back into that warm booth-diner Magic and admire the spectacular view of the Sears Tower. This weather used to murder our ancestors in their caves. Now it's a time-killing novelty, though coincidentally our meat arrives correctly and the same way they did.. rare as hellWe made it by kitchen's midday close and watched as people continued in up to 20 minutes past last call. Celebrate with a cocktail.. or three. All were solid, and the Flapper the best of the three with the pepper-honey contrasts amidst the boozy gin-fernet combo.The burger is as fantastic as they say, better than Red Hot Ranch's 4/5 just nights prior. Cheval's has better acidity in the pickles as cheese runs out from under the bun. Of course we got the requisite bacon and egg. It's not as tangy as PDX's Slow Bar, but showcases a fantastic grind and incredible texture. An absolute must when in Chi."
"This is it. This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Whenever friends come to visit this is always in my top three places we are going to go for food. I take pride bringing folks who call themselves foodies here. Why? Everything on the menu is spot on. Everything. The cheeseburgers are the best in the city...and for me the best I've ever had. (Warning: order a single. A singe is a double. A double is 4 patties!!). The foie gras is amazing and it's home to my favorite bone marrow. When people tell me they haven't had bone marrow- I ruin it for them by bringing them here so they can start with the best. If you're feeling super hungry- the 32oz porterhouse with foie gras is the way to go. It's a monster and worth every dollar. On top of top notch food, their cocktails are made just right. Not too strong and not too weak. The atmosphere is dark and moody just like its sister restaurants High Five Ramen, Gilt Bar, California Clipper, Etc. This place is great for dates, birthdays, weekend hang outs, whatever!"
Too small burgers but tasty foods loved it.
"3.5 hour wait. 1 person. I think I heard this before. Hey Parson's, do you own this place too? Really? For a burger...I mean you don't even have lettuce on this damn thing. I don't know about the service yet! But the patrons are D-bags. Hey Bro, I am just trying to order a beer. I ain't trying to C&@K block you from you next meal. (Doesn't look like your starving anyways). Don't get me wrong, the food looks amaze-balls but I don't think I am going to wait a year and a day for a burger. It does have a cool ambiance. The music is hip and different. I have a feeling I won't leave with a migraine, like another burger place in Avalon that I will not name. (Kuma's)So here is the ""Hot Buy"" for this place. Listen up! They have a beer here called ""Shake"". Holy S-H-Eye-Tee! Chocolate Stout, with hints of (get this) Cocoa Puffs and Vanilla. Bang! Screw the Burger. Get me another pint.Uh oh, I think they read my review already. (Literally 5 Minutes Later). I got a seat! Yikes. I hope they don't spit in my food. Review on the food soon to come.....Here it is! The review on the burger. First of all, if I am going to eat a burger it better in a word or two ""have some BALLS"" on it. This hamburger does not let down. I ordered the double aka triple burger with an egg and bacon. Did I say bacon? It was so thick I thought I was eating pork belly on my burger. It was massive. It was severed open faced for visual pleasure and oh' boy was it any eye full. This thing was the Cadillac version McDonalds Mc DLT's. I put this thing together and was super scared that I might need to unhinge my jaw just to eat this sucker. Never the less I wasn't turning in my man card just yet. I hunched over and took this monstrosity into my mouth. The burger exploded with every flavor imaginable. You could taste the meats, the pickles, the sauces, even the damn bun. As I ate it pieces of everything we're falling to the plate because it was so damn big. The best part was soaking up the egg yolk l and all the morsels on the plate. I wasn't going to waste my time with fries. I don't think it was possible after this edible work of art. The best part of this meal was that the ""Shake"" stout that I got went perfect with this perfected sandwich. I will be going back in the near future. Who needs lettuce, pickles, onion, sauce and a sesame bun when you have a gift from the Gods. Thanks!"
"Last 3-4 visits the burger is too done, bun too toasted, and now a different type of brioche bun??Au Cheval will live and die by the consistency of their once simple, great, and consistent burger.Hope they figure this out soon!"
"I know I'm going to upset some with this review, but I've been twice and I don't think I'll go back.The first time I went was on a Sunday afternoon for some drinks with a friend, there was no wait and we got two stools at the bar. We sat there for a long time, and it wasn't even crowded. We stared at the bartender who didn't take notice of us and then we flagged her down after she made awkward eye contact. She explained that we had to order drinks with a server but she knew we had been waiting awhile and made an exception. We ordered our beers, mine was meh, and after awhile we waited again. It was sometime later that we were even acknowledged by a server despite our efforts. The line cooks (who shouldn't be doing any serving) were the ones who provided us with water. We got another round and asked for our check.I went about a week later for the food. We waited about 45 minutes for a table. The host was really friendly and we liked his selection of music. We ordered a burger (the single comes with 2 patties) and the English breakfast to share. The burger patties were cooked perfectly! But I personally thought the dijonnaise over powered everything. It's not like some other burger shops where it comes with LTO. There was the cheddar and then the dijonnaise. The English breakfast comes with sausage, beans, roasted tomato, which was all good- except for the EGGS! The eggs were cooked well but tasted like pure butter, and not in a good way. I couldn't eat it because it was so rich. I tried a few beers that night too and none of them blew me away, and considering the drinks are quite pricey that wasn't the best use of money. To top that off, I felt our server wasn't a happy camper, we certainly didn't feel welcome.There are so many things working for Au Cheval- atmosphere, decor, menu, the cooks are definitely talented- that it's a shame that the food didn't taste as good as it should (IMO). Considering the wait for a table here, I can't say that the food holds up for the effort required to eat here."
"Stop going there, please. Avoid it all costs. You're all making my waits there longer and longer. Four of us tried going there last night at 5:30 and there was a 3 and a half hour wait. No joke. It's so damn good, I went back today for lunch and got in a lot faster. Anyways, I'm kidding... it is my favorite burger. Au Cheval, definitely fits into the diner category, but it's an upscale, ""trendy"" diner. Think more whiskey, less coffee type of diner. So here's the deal about the burger. If you're a fan of more gourmet burgers, like Kuma's or Bad Apple, you might not understand why it's so damn good. If you like more griddle style burgers like In N' Out, Shake Shack, Meatheads, but want a better burger than that... you'll love Au Cheval. The burgers are thin, salty, delicious patties that will be dripping as you're tasting heaven. The single is a double patty, the double is a triple patty. It's delicious, it hits my spot like no other burger. Everyone has a different taste for burgers... for me, Au Cheval nails it."
"I think I may have set the bar too high going into my first Au Cheval dinner experience. I did expect the long wait, but figured out quickly it's not necessarily the food reputation (which is obviously good), but the fact that they only have 15 tables plus bar! So not impressed by this. Part of my non-enthusiasm is fueled by our party of four being seated at a small table and not a booth - which made the experience uncomfortable. I don't know many people who enjoy constantly shifting things around on the table to make it all fit, desperately trying not to spill food in their lap because their plate is only half on the table. But I will say some of the booths looked roomier and I am envious of those people who luck out.For the food - everyone in my party got the burger so I decided to be different and go with the general Jane's fried chicken. Cooked perfectly, and sauce was like kapow in my mouth! I'm just not sure it was worth $17. Our side of fries to share was too salty and far from the best I've had. As far as drinks, we all ordered wine and I would recommend the southern right sauvignon blanc - very good."
"Came here after a long bike ride, which means we were starving and didn't want to waste any time. Even around 5 PM on a weekday, this place was already pretty crowded. We were told that we'd have to wait about 30-45 minutes, but luckily we got a table within less than 10 minutes.We kinda already knew that we wanted the burger, so we ordered that and a special, limited edition item which the waitress recommended -- poached egg with smoked salmon spread, which was served with some grill-toasted bread. As one who really loves smoked salmon, I really enjoyed the spread. It was just smoky enough and not overly salty.The burger was amazing. It's not often that I use this adjective to describe burgers, since I'm somewhat of a burger snob. But this one blew my mind. I got it with bacon (two damn thick slices!), cheddar, and an egg. No, I wasn't being health conscious that day. But I certainly don't regret it, either.We also got an order of chicken wings, which I thought were good, and my wife thought were great. It had a nice touch of sweetness to them, kinda like Bon Chon wings, but not as crispy. Overall, I'd recommend these to anyone.Lastly, the service was excellent. The waitress was nice, prompt, attentive, and was able to recommend some good local beers to suit my taste."
Best burger in the city!! Love the thick cut bacon or egg to add on the burger. Fries are great also. So excited they are opening a new spot in Bucktown for takeout or dine in.
It is all that it is cracked up to be. No questions. Just go! The line is well worth the wait. I went pregnant (meaning my burger was well done) and it was still the best burger of my life.
"HYPE. HYPE. HYPE. So, I went to grab a burger-to-go this afternoon since I've heard so much about this place. I was told that since it's busy they don't do carry out.  What?? On a Sunday afternoon? That's exactly when it SHOULD be available!!! Then on the way out I witnessed a fight break out in the line. Umm, seriously?$17 for eggs and tortilla chips (aka chilaquiles)?Maybe someone will clue them in on an effective business model that includes not turning away business (i.e. delivery and carry out). For a place that thinks American cheese and an egg make a craft burger, it's just not worth the hype. I'll take my business elsewhere."
"Yum!!!! Got the burger with bacon and egg on top.The bacon is very overpowering so I took one piece off and ate it on its own, which I recommend cause the bacon itself is amazing. The egg made it perfect. Everything was extremely extremely extremely salty so I knocked a star off for that. The burger could use slight more freshness like a slice of tomato. But overall definitely the best burger I have ever ate."
"As everyone else has yelped the burgers are simple and once you add the thick cut bacon, a perfect balance of smoky, salty, rich and cheesy awesomeness.  Aside from the burgers, fries and drinks I can't say I particularly like or dislike anything else on the menu, but what else do you need, lol.  The Vieux Bonal is greatness in a glass.  Try it."
"If I could only eat one thing everyday for the rest of my life it would be Au Cheval's burger and fries! The 2 hour wait was well worth it in the end...This place has an old school diner vibe with an open kitchen behind the bar.  Classic hip hop tunes from The Roots, Jay-Z, Junior Boys, and Notorious B.I.G. flooded the speakers making the experience even more enjoyable.  The cooks were visibly having a great time while pumping out burgers by the dozens and made you feel welcome.  I recommend sitting at the bar and watching their craft! And for the wait...arrive two hours before you would like to eat, put your name in, and head on over to Bar Siena for a cocktail and apps."
This was hands down the best burger I have ever had in my life...you absolutely have to get the fried egg and bacon on the burger!!!!
"Rare 5 star from The Draft M man!  The place is great on a number of levels.  Power jams on the sound system, uber-friendly staff, cool vibe, great decor.  Oh...burgers are everything they are advertised to be.  Believe the hype.  On Par with the accolades!"
"I took the ultimate burger-lover here earlier this week and it was definitely a good move. I mis-read the menu online; I thought that the kitchen re-opened at 3, but it is at 5, so we were quite early when we arrived at 4:15. Luckily, that meant that we had our selection of booths to choose from and were able to pick a couple of beers to try until dinner. The atmosphere is hispter (are we surprised?) and the interior is darker and smaller than I expected. There are probably 7 or 8 booths and then 8 - 10 tables that seat 2 or 3 people; no wonder the wait is always so long! We kind of got caught in a weird time where I think the servers from lunch were getting ready to leave and the dinner servers hadn't come in yet, so we waited a solid 15 minutes before someone came up to take our orders - and it turned out they were kind of just doing us a favor, because they left shortly thereafter. I was immediately impressed by the beer list. I found several Belgian beers that looked good and the server recommended two in particular, both of which I enjoyed (but I preferred the Urthel, and apparently so did Beyonce when she dined there). I'm not usually a burger person, but what else can you get on your first visit to this famed restaurant? Duh. I ordered the single, the man ordered the double, both of which are misnomers. They are a double and at least a triple, respectively. I added the fried egg and bacon and the man went classic.So how was it? Really good. The egg was a great touch, but I didn't care for the bacon; I prefer my pork fat salty rather than sweet and smoky. The fact that it was a slab rather than strips made it easier to eat with the burger, though. The egg was a nice touch. We agreed that it was the best burger in recent memory but we probably aren't willing to trek to West Loop to get it each time when we have some local Lincoln Park faves, too. I recommend the fries as a side because the garlic aioli is TO DIE FOR, but steer clear of the bread and butter pickles if you think they're going to be fried or dill. They're not either.This is WAY more than I intended to write, but all is to say that I think it's a must on any Chicago food bucket list, it was definitely worth going at 4:15 to get a head start on their awesome beer list, the fries were heavenly, and the burger lived up to the anticipation."
Wait was long but so worth it. Sat at the bar & our waitress took great care of us. Tons of local brews & drink options. I had the cheeseburger & fries .... LIFE-CHANGING. Best burger I've ever had.
"Been on a 5-star tear lately, which I'm definitely not complaining about.Came to Au Cheval for brunch on a Saturday. I was told by the locals that it was a very popular place, and that we should get there before it opened at 11am. Sure enough, we got there right at 1035, and there was already a line outside. Nonetheless, we managed to secure a booth for 4 in the front with no wait, since we were only about 4 spots back in the line. Throughout our meal, there were people coming in and out, and new parties coming in waiting for a new table, looking longingly in our direction. Heh. The diner-like atmosphere was very comfortable, although a little darker than I expected. We ordered the richest items on the menu even though we planned on hitting up Oak Street Beach after. I ordered the cheeseburger a cheval with bacon, and my friends ordered the duck heart gravy potato hash, fried bologna sandwich, and the small chilaquiles. We also got an order of fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli, and a fried egg on top, for the table. Brunch is served. After trying burgers from all over the country, I can say that the cheeseburger is one of the best I've ever had. First off, the single cheeseburger is actually a double patty. There is no lettuce or tomato (to my knowledge), but only pickle chips, cheese, and bacon (or an egg if you would like to add it). You would think it would be super rich, but the acidity from the pickles is strong enough to cut through the fattiness. Perfect. I was also fine that this didn't come with fries, mostly because we already got the order of fries for the table, and that the burger in itself was enough.The chilaquiles were a huge portion, and since the tortillas were thicker than usual, they didn't get soggy with the eggs and salsa verde. Also, the small portion was more than enough for just one person. The duck heart gravy potato hash was delicious, and had a very unique flavor. I thought there would be a strong iron taste, but the flavors and textures worked pretty well. I had a bite of the fried bologna sandwich, which was a bit salty for my taste, but I can see how it would really hit the spot if you were looking for salty, greasy goodness.Service was very attentive and friendly. French press coffee was great. Overall, just a really great experience. Next time I'm in Chicago, I will definitely make a trip back to try that bone marrow and fried chicken."
"Thin delicious little pickles, big buttery fried egg, thick, sweet bacon, pickled onions, and a patty cooked at medium. It's ridiculous. This burger makes people so happy. I love the records they played while we were there. The bartender didn't seem to know that any of us existed, but the waitstaff was preternaturally attentive. What a crazy, fucking burger."
"This place was so tasty!  The burgers here are definitely worth the wait and the best in Chicago!!!!  A ""single"" is actually two patties!  It was a little awkward waiting for our table since this place is not huge and they don't take reservations but we enjoyed a drink next door after putting our names in for the wait list.  I really wish they took reservations.  I have referred many people.  I could eat that garlic aioli with a spoon, that they give you with the French fries."
"I sat at the counter for dinner and boy do I have so much respect for the chefs. I'm sure a lot of chefs at other restaurants are as efficient as Au Chevals but it was really cool to see it first hand through the open kitchen.I had the burger and fried with aioli sauce and they are just so delicious cooked perfectly, highly recommend.I've had the fries all 3 times I've been there and they're good every time. Why? Probably bc a chef tastes a sample of each fry that goes out to ensure each batch is cooked properly. Talk about excellent quality control. After watching the well oiled machine that are the chefs at au Cheval, I'll know my meal was carefully prepped and cooked for to provide consistent yumminess"
"Au Cheval totally lives up to the hype! Would absolutely say the burger at Au Cheval is among, if not The, best burger in the city of Chicago. They don't take reservations, so if you are looking to go for dinner plan to wait a significant amount of time. We put our name in around 7:00pm on a Thursday and went around the corner for drinks while we waited for the text confirming our table was ready. We waited for ~1.5hours but it was totally worth the wait =). We were sat at the bar, which we ended up loving. For dinner we kept it simple and got:- Honey fried chicken: we were surprised at how delicious this chicken was! And the portion was huge - we ordered it as an appetizer and had a ton left over to take home. Warmed up deliciously the next day- Au Cheval burger, of course with bacon & a fried egg. The bacon was no less than 1/2 inch thick and was very tasty - my boyfriend ordered a side of it, as well. We also got fries, but hardly touched them.Will definitely be back for this amazing burger again!!"
"This is one of those rare situations where you disregard the comically long wait, shit attitude of the staff (worse than the door guys at Moda back in the day) and annoying customer base in order to enjoy the great food. For fans of Chinese food, the fried chicken appetizer is as good as it gets, and the burger's reputation is well deserved. I docked one star because I was so hungry one night that I couldn't wait 2.5 hours (like I said...comically long) and got stuck eating garbage at grange hall a few doors down (don't fall into this trap)...jk about the star...it's because of the shit attitude."
"YES! This place is worth the wait.. Even if it is a 2 hour wait, put your name in, go have a drink at Haymarket and wait! By far the best burger in the city! Ideal order is to start with the chopped salad with bacon, than the burger with an egg and bacon on top and the French fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli and egg.. YUM! But honestly, no matter what you get here everything is delicious! And Chef Giuseppe is awesome, hopefully he's working when your there!!Oh oh and you must try a pickle back shot! Shot of Irish whiskey first and chase it with a shot of pickle juice.. May sound gross but it's so delicious!"
God bless this place. I wish they opened one in Texas. I would be here every day.Get the burger and the fried chicken. You won't regret it.
"Went for lunch on a Friday with a couple friends, we arrived at 12:30 & host said it would be 1-1.5 hour wait, which they text u when your table is ready, so you can hit another bar if it's packed inside. We stayed, they have 10-15 draft beer choices that I was happy with.Ok, the food...""make your tongue want to slap your brains out"". We started w beef bone marrow which was delightful with thick cut garlic bread. Then had General Jane's fried chicken, this had a great Asian heat with sweet bbq sauce that gives kickass balance. I also had half, bc I shared the double cheeseburger w thick crispy juicy bacon, fried egg & cheese. When I took my first bite, my initial reaction was, where in top 5 burgers do I put this amazing fresh tasting burger. Burger itself looks cheap or like smash steak burger, but was complete opposite. Then for side, had fries w garlic aioli w fried egg on top, wasn't too spectacular but can't complain. Waitstaff was cordial, had great variety of music & relaxed vibe inside. Highly recommend this place & will definitely be visiting again."
Phenomenal burger .. Everything you have may have heard is true! Their burgers are delectable!! Two other favorites of mine are their herb salad and homemade ranch dressing..to dip your fries! So good.
"Heard they have the best burger in Chicago and being the foodie I am, I had to try it. It's on the pricier side but well worth it. This place is a real treat. Quality ingredients."
"While doing some late night wandering around Randolph St some friends and I stumbled upon Au Cheval. The bar is smaller then some of the others in the area, but the atmosphere is great, with plenty of booths for groups of friends grabbing drinks.  The bar had plenty of seating for smaller groups or those enjoying a beverage solo. Service was quick, cocktails were tasty, and the burger and fries were the best decision I made that night. Definitely stop in here for drinks AND even better- for a late night dinner/snack- when checking out bars on Randolph st."
"The food is amazing.  People at work rant and rave about this place so the BF and I went.  We had the brat appetizer.  It's not enough for a meal but perfect of our app.  We both had a double burger and it was massive, order the single.  The server was soooooo nice and personable.  She recommended the hash brown bun and egg on top for me.  OMG she was right.  I've never had an egg on a burger but it was amazing.  The hashbrown bun is really a thick hash brown.  It works well with the burger.  You don't need fries on the side.  The only downfall of this place is they don't take reservations and it's super packed all the time.  WE were there on a Thursday at 8pm.  We thought it would be safe that late at night...nope.  We didn't get seated until 9pm.  We walked out at 1030 completely stuffed.  If we go back, we'll definitely expect to wait and go hungry."
"Sunday brunch consisted of the trumpet mushroom, kale, and morel jack cheese omelet with a side of fries for me and chilaquiles for my friend.That might be the best omelet I've ever had.  It was perfectly shaped, buttery, and delicious.  I'm now giving other omelets the side-eye.  My friend's chilaquiles also looked very good, though I did not taste them."
"Everyone knows this place's reputation for great burgers and long waits. I happy to say neither are exaggerated. We were ok with the wait because could put our name in on the way home, relax and change at home, and walk back over at around the time our table was ready. We put our name in about 5pm on a Sunday, and it was about a 1.5hr wait from that point, so the timing worked out nicely. By the time we were seated though they were quoting people 2.5 t o 3hr waits. As to the food, I was fully prepared for it to be good, but over-hyped. And I guess you could rightly argue that no food is worth a 3hr wait. But if you have a way to kill some time, it is WELL worth the wait. The burgers are really fantastic. Giant, fork and knife ordeals with the approximate weight and density of a black hole. Other stuff on the menu looked good too, but the burgers are the main attraction. We got one with egg and one with bacon, and both were excellent. Though I don't know that the burger really needs either. It would be just as good without. Also, my two cents is always get the single not the double. The ""single"" is already two patties, and the double felt like.. maybe 6 patties. Its more than I or most other humans really needed, and the single was every bit as good. We shared fries too, which were also outstanding. Briny and crispy and served with a spicy mayo type sauce. They also have a lot of good beers which you can sip out front while waiting in line. The environment is small, fun and loud. Great place, deserves its cult status."
"My friends LOVE this place. Everyone comes here for the burgers (add bacon, always with bacon). I don't eat beef, but I'll eat the ish out of chicken! lol. The crispy chicken wings are sooooooo good. Drenched in honey chili sauce, wings remain crispy! Shared with a friend and we couldn't finish..because...We also ordered the chicken liver, butter, and toast. Chunky/chopped chicken liver, just a different take on chicken liver.  Uh.....omg this is so good. I had to refrain from eating all of it (that can't be good for you, right)?"
Good food but poor & inattentive service and filthy ice!! I'll try the bone marrow next time
"Very good food! Love their simple green salad, a great alternative to french fries that won't disappoint..."
"Okay, obviously Au Cheval probably doesn't need another review, but holy moly. WHAT an amazing burger. More than that, though, I found everyone to be super friendly-- the host, my waiter, the delightful woman sitting next to me who helped guide me through the menu. And! I had a great beer for only $5. My big tip is, if you can swing it, go alone at a semi-off time, and you can slide right onto a bar stool with no wait time. If not, be prepared for a long (but worth it!) wait."
"This is a casual diner and they don't take reservations. Overall, I enjoyed my meal. I had the matzo ball soup, sweet and tangy chicken (love the sauce and generous portion), and the famous burger. The burger was good, but not mouthwatering. The fried egg and the bacon is a LA carte which I think it adds another $10 to the base price of the burger. It's a good burger but I wouldn't say it's the best. Btw, walked into there Sunday night at 9pm and it was a 2.to 3 hours wait.... good luck!"
"So my husband and I thought we panned our timing to get a seat here perfectly when we came in around 4pm. We thought we would beat the dinner rush. Well we did, but we didn't realize that the kitchen closes between 3-5pm. So that basically meant that we would drink for an hour before we could order food. So we started off at the bar. They were finishing making up some last minute orders before the kitchen closed so it still smelled delicious. We pretty much stayed and ordered some drinks. I liked their forbidden root, root beer.A few more tables cleared up a little before the kitchen reopened and we were able to move to a booth. We both ordered cheeseburgers which were juicy and delicious. We also ordered the crispy fries with the farm fresh egg on top: crispy and just a little runny. Will need to go back for sure and a few drinks 45 min before the kitchen reopens isn't such a bad wait."
"Looks closed when you approach it, but look inside for a new age blast from the past diner full of delicious drinks and a wide variety of different people. What I like most is the different drinks, but the service can use improvement. The check in was around the corner and it felt like a troll was sneaking up on you and the waiter had a hard time with basic arithmetics. It's pretty easy to split a check but she thought it might be too burdensome. Would come here again to try their food."
"Was okay, everything's was cooked in pig grease including the fries in which I sent back considering I like my fries to taste like potatoes not pig. If you love piggy flavor you will love this place... Not the best burger I've had (try dirty burger up the street...amaze)."
"The hype is real!I went with my girlfriend went to Au Cheval on a Friday exactly at 5, when the kitchen was supposed to be open. I am guessing they opened a little earlier than listed and all the tables were FULL!! We were still happy to sit at the bar to watch the kitchen, but I am assuming parties of 5 or 6 are the max at this restaurant.It was so entertaining watching the kitchen, especially the guy on hamburger duty.. it seems EVERYONE and their mothers ordered the hamburger! I opted for the bone marrow and beef cheek marmalade which is divine! My girlfriend ordered the burger and was so happy! Hamburger orders do not come with fries, but there was so much food already and service was so friendly that we didn't need it. One of the chefs was so friendly we chatted a bit and gave me more toast (free) for my beef cheeks.It was an amazing experience and we WILL come again!!"
"Best burger I've ever had. We went at 10 pm on a Tuesday night thinking the wait wouldn't be too bad, but it ended up being a two hour wait. While the burger was outstanding, the service felt a bit rushed. Definitely not a good choice if you're looking to relax and enjoy a more low-key meal, but the burger is incredible."
"Great burgers, long wait."
"After reading reviews and drooling over photos for the past few moths, I finally ventured to the infamous Au Cheval on a weekend trip to Chicago.Sunday night at 8pm and the wait was already 1.5/2hrs. Thankfully we were prepared and headed across the street to entertain & feed ourselves in the meantime.about an hour and 20 minutes in, we were summoned over and hastily reached our table practically drooling already.Service was friendly and well-timed. Atmosphere was that of an upscale, trendy diner. All in all quite pleasing after an extremely long wait.Food:-Burger: Fully loaded, double-decker, king of fastfood burgers everywhere. While it was sure a pretty sight, it wasn't the best burger I've had. I typically like my burgers more on the medium rare side and this was far from that. Both patties were fairly dry and flavorless, making biting into this monster far from perfect.-Fries: Fantastically crisped in duck fat, these fries stole the show. Some of the best fries I've ever had, and if I ever returned to Au Cheval, it would be for them alone.All in all, while a top notch ""diner"" experience, Au Cheval did not blow me away. Their burger is far from perfect and in my opinion, does not warrant a 2 hour + wait. I would maybe return for those fries though.."
What has not been said about these burgers?  The burger was awesome and lived up to everything I had heard and read.  I loved the sauce and chopped onion and pickle slices.  I am looking forward to going back asap.
"Waited 3.5 hours for some of the best fries. Amazing garlic aioli. Great food. Giant portions. Decent price.Docked a star for the ridiculous wait and the very very loud music.All in all, it was worth it. Though if I'd ever go back, I'd be sure to go early to avoid such a long wait."
"The only complaint I have about Au Cheval is that, after eating their cheeseburger, it is unlikely I will ever be able to be satisfied sexually again.On a serious note, though, be sure to be prepared for long wait times. The host will take down your name and number and shoot you a text when your table is ready, but you will likely have to put in your name 1-2 hours prior to being actually seated. Luckily there are options aplenty nearby to grab a drink and kill some time.Seriously get the burger."
"This is what Jimmy Buffett must have in mind when he sings about cheeseburgers in paradise.  Perfect bun-to-meat ratio, cheese melted to perfection, fresh bun, crisp cold pickle spear.  If I were on death row, I'd be dialing Au Cheval with my ""last meal"" order.  Not inexpensive.  A single burger and fries (with water to drink) came to $22 with tax and gratuity, but if you're still smiling four hours after lunch, it's money well-spent, friends."
"(4.5) We waited 3 hours but what I really liked was you didn't have to be present to keep your place, so we were able to do a lot of things. we all got the cheeseburgers with fried egg and seriously enjoyed it- our only complaint would be the burgers were pretty messy! The service was awesome given how crowded it was and I think we seriously enjoyed our visit. I would just recommend planning at least half to day for this adventure though."
"Unreal cheeseburger! While getting a spot inside was a little less spectacular, I managed to grab the lone seat at the bar. 3:30 on a Sunday afternoon and the place was jammed. However, a couple Stone Sublimley Self-Righteous's, eccelctic electro background music, and a low-key hipster atmosphere eased the shoulder to shoulder awkwardness. Service was a bit underwhelming, but they were full up, and I can hardly knock them. The Burger au cheval, accompanied by bacon and egg (extra), was officially the best burger I've ever had. Every freaking thing about it was magical. What else can one say?! Worth every dollar and minute of waiting. Meat, cheese, egg, thick cut bacon, and bun....Heaven @ Au Cheval!"
"Good burger, not great service, great beer selection.Even if the most casual of places I'm not cool with being greated with a 'What's Up, Hommies?' by the server.  It's even worse that was only one of two times we saw her the entire meal.  Quarters are pretty tight and lines typically are long so keep that in mind if you head there with a party larger than four.I'd definitely head back if I was in the area but not if it meant waiting for more than 10 minutes."
"A good diner, but not much more.The environment:Very trendy, but loud. So if you are tired of listening to you partner, this place could work :)The food:Chicken liver : surprisingly tasty! This comes with A LOT of bread, so take that into account - if you are trying to avoid carbs, avoid this dish.Single burger: This is actually surprisingly mediocre. Almost no vegetables, and the meat itself is just not that good. Do not order the burger here. The other options are much better.  3-layer cake: OK, not amazing. not much to say here... Worth visiting, but not a must."
"The burger is legit here. It is surprisingly simple and I think that's part of why I like it so much. They don't hide behind a wall of various ingredients to hide anything. Add the fried egg and bacon for extra awesomeness. The presentation of the egg is delightful as there is a light sprinkling of finely diced green onions. Seeing it that way makes you not want to destroy the work of art. Eating that bacon is out of this world too. Those slices are ultra thick, are lightly crisped, and have a nice balance of meat and fat. French fries are tasty as is the garlic aioli dipping sauce. The beer menu is solid as well. Unless you're a huge craft beer junkie, you will most likely find a beer you haven't heard of before. Definitely a good chance to try a new beer and enjoy an awesome burger. I will gladly come back to enjoy myself again... and I suggest you do the same. Go during off hours or prepare to wait in line forever."
"Simple, elegant, excellent. Do restaurants get better than this? Everything on the menu is delicious, including the peculiar-sounding duck heart gravy fries. Whatever else you get, make sure you try the burger (quite possibly one of the best no-frills, meat, cheese, and egg burgers in the city). The drink menu is also surprisingly comprehensive (they have interesting wines). The decor is dark, the environment is loud (btw solid music playlist), and the place - being small - is ALWAYS CROWDED. There are no reservations and wait times are as legendary as you've heard. Despite the wait and the higher price the quality of the food and experience makes every penny and every hour wait worth it."
"This is an outstanding burger.  The meat to cheese to bun ratio is nearly perfect and it'll make you forget about your quick and dirty fix, ketchup, for the rest of the day.  The cheese and dash of Dijon are a wonderful departure from most other burgers out there.It's one of my staples when visiting Chicago, but definitely go at off-peak hours."
"My boyfriend and I went late on a Sunday night, waited about 20 minutes for a seat at the bar.From there, we had full view of the line-cooks while they grilled a hundred burgers at time, while frying bacon, pulling buckets of fries out of the fryer, plate and serve the dishes - all the action was happening right in front of us.You wouldn't have this view if seated in a table/booth, but in the case of it being the two of us out for dinner, I was enjoying the show.The atmosphere is sultry and sexy, the music is energetic and trendy.  And being that I am an ""experience-oriented"" reviewer - I loved all of this.My boyfriend is the foodie, and I always write on his behalf:Burger was solid, bacon is thick and tasty, but will overpower the taste of the burger.  The fries were good, and the chopped salad with bacon and egg was very flavorful - almost overwhelmingly so.  Overall, highly recommended."
"I was visiting a friend in Chicago and we came her for brunch on my last full day in town. The recommendation from the group was to ""Try the Burger"" and I did!! YUMMERS!! It has a fried egg on it and is a mess to eat but it is so damn good!! I was thinking that it was going to be too rich for so early in the morning, but it was so good that I didn't care! I would say that my only issue with this place, that it is SUPER SMALL in there! Don't go with a large group! I felt like I was sitting at the table next to me! That part was no bueno...."
"The best burger I've ever had!!! It's amazing! Get there early though. There's usual lines and the diner is quite small, seating merely 25-30. The bone marrow is terrific and succulent and the tuna tartar Is special.I've only had the burger there and it was by far my favorite burger in Chicago! So juicy and delicious. The thick cut bacon is a must and I recommend holding off on the egg because it makes quite the mess. Absolutely recommend trying it at least once!"
"Favorite burger in Chicago. General Jane's chicken also great. They always over estimate the wait time by about double. Great vibe, music, staff."
"I was convinced this place wouldn't live up to the hype. Maybe that helped my experience. I actually went in almost expecting to hate it. I was in love! We arrived right around 4:30pm on a Saturday. I think that's key here. Get there right at or before 5pm to avoid the wait. It's WAY smaller than I thought inside. It's also so much prettier than I expected. No joke, this place could make you fall in love with whoever you are with! The Hemingway daiquiri was life changing. I had 2 even though I clearly should of only had 1. It was worth the headache the following morning. The beer list is decent. Some of the staff wasn't all that helpful with it though. We ended up splitting the single (actually a double) cheeseburger, fries with garlic aioli and mashed potatoes with gravy. We added the bacon and fried egg on the burger too. This bacon was out of control. I don't know how they made it taste so good. Hands down the best bacon I've ever had if that makes any sense. Unless you can eat massive amounts of food I would say splitting is the way to go here. Although, it was so good I probably could have done it. Service ranged from amazing to snotty. It was weird. Whatever. The music was good. The lighting was perfect and it's the best night I've had in years!"
Wait was ridiculous but well worth it in the long haul. Burger was amazing and rootbeer float equally as good!
"Best burger in America.I cannot vouch as I don't eat meat but mostly b/c the person who got the burger at my table did not share.  That's a strong endorsement!  He ate that burger as slowly and carefully as possible so he could savor every lovin' molecule of it.  The next day he said, ""I hope you really liked that omelet because I'm going to want that burger again and again!""I believe my boyfriend when he says that.  He's a bit of a burger connoisseur. That being said like all of the other Brendan Sodikoff joints this one is amazing!  Great service, cool atmosphere, and the food and drink is outstanding.My omelet was maybe the best omelet I've ever had.  It was cooked to perfection!  We also shared some fries which were great.  My friend tried the fried chicken b/c the chicken at Bavette's is so great.  It was very good but too spicy!  My other friend got the sausage and mashed potatoes.  We all started with a horse's neck and then tried and old fashioned.  They were wonderful.I'm sure we'll be back!"
"This place was def a favorite when I visited Chicago. The ambiance is chill, laid back and perfect to start your night out. The chilli is a must have it comes with a bag of Fritos so make sure to bring your appetite or play puff puff pass prior. The staff was very friendly and had honest suggestions that were on point. Beers on point. Overall an amazing place. Wish they were in Miami."
"Best burger in the city...well it's up there! Super cute burger spot! Good service, simple menu, quick and efficient!  (Staff not very friendly tho...they seemed unhappy...maybe an off day) Go when they open because if not, expect to wait upwards of 1 1/2 hour! Most definitely a once a month visit...on my cheat day! lol"
"I had recently seen this place on a top ten list for best hamburgers in the US and so we thought, 'Why not?'First, there was an hour wait at 10:45 on a Sunday. We decided to put our name on the list and walk around. The host promised to text us when they had a table. We actually checked back in before he texted and they had 2 seats at the bar, perfect.We got to watch them prepare everything, and it looked mouth watering the whole time we were waiting for our food. We both got the Burger a cherval with cheese, bacon, and a sunny side up egg. It also came with homemade pickles, dijonaise spread, and chopped onions. We got an orders of Frieswith mornay sauce, garlic aoli, and another sunny side up egg. Everything was as good as advertised. This place may have ruined me for burgers anywhere else. There is no need for additional condiments, the whole burger is perfect as is (and this comes from someone who thinks EVERYTHING needs additional condiments). Can't say enough good things about this place."
The best burger I have ever eaten. This place is amazing. They don't take reservations so make sure you are okay with waiting or try for a brunch timeslot. Little Goat bakery is next door if you need to grab coffee while you wait.Worth going back - it's mind blowing.
"One word: pickleback.Great, great bar. Au Cheval popped my pickleback cherry with their Irish whiskey and home-made brine, but oooh was it so good.  The bar has other great features such as a wood-toned, leather interior, intimate seating, and fantastic, albeit spunky, servers.  My friend and I had eaten before coming here hence only had drinks and fries (which are delectably crispy), but the burgers looked amazing (with that perfect egg on top).I highly recommend!"
"Au Cheval is a shrine to protein and fat, in the best way possible.Take a quick look at their menu, and you will notice that they only have one vegetable dish. Everything else is an ode to heavy, heavy protein, mixing classic diner comfort food with classy French flair.I would recommend everything I've tried, but my favorite appetizers have been the chopped chicken liver, bone marrow (which comes with a deliciously tangy beef cheek marmalade that cuts the unctuousness of the marrow), and foie gras with scrambled eggs. All of them come with thick-cut, buttered toast...believe me, it's easy to overdo it on that bread...I know many people swear by Au Cheval's burger, and I agree it is very good, but in my opinion, the fried bologna, piled high on a bun and oozing with melted cheese, is the superior sandwich.The only downside to Au Cheval is the wait: I've come here early and late, week days and weekends, and have never had to wait less than 30 minutes for a table. Oh, and let's hope you didn't have big plans following dinner, because you might be to full too move..."
"Best burger in the city to date - got mine with both the egg and bacon, but next time I'd just stick to the egg (bacon was too fatty, in my opinion). I've heard horror stories about the lines, but we were seated pretty quickly. My only other complaint is that the booths are kind of cramped, but they're working with the space that they've got, I guess. Five stars are reserved for places with impeccable service as well as food and I don't remember the service being memorable, but I'd give this place 4.5 stars if I could."
"Best burger of my life.  Period. I got the double, which is actually a triple with an egg and bacon. Didn't think it was humanly possible to eat it bc it was so huge but I managed! Long wait but you can sit next door at the Lone Wolf bar and they will call you, no reservations. Waited about 40 minutes on a week night early (5 or 6pm)"
"I wasn't thrilled with my first time here.... but everyone I was with order for the group. It was defiantly good, and I think I need to go back and try some other things. The atmosphere was fun, but don't expect to have much of a conversation!"
"Love the food but the service is terrible, I will never come back again. Keep in mind, I never give 1 star, my avg is 3-5. It was 12:28 a.m., I was with 4 other ppl and waiting for another person to close his tab across the street, they wouldn't seat us even though there were a ton of open tables. I knew it was late and they were closing soon, so I tried telling the host I already had his order so we can get things going, still wouldn't seat us. Sat at the bar (had about 10 seats open) and they were like sorry you can't sit here either if your whole party isn't here. I told her I didn't care if he sat alone, I was hungry and wanted to order. Still made us get out of the empty seats. Then when he got there 10 min later, she sat the 6 of us in a small ass booth that should really sit 4. Also can't order to go, annoying. So we just sat at the small ass table, 3 people ate their burgers and the rest of us just took it to go."
"After venturing out to the Windy City my friend wouldn't stop raving about this spot! She made me promise that I'd try it before I left. Best. Promise. Ever.Cheese burger had thick cuts of bacon. I mean thick, like Nicki Minaj thick.. Real, solid cuts of piggy bacon fat. Ridiculous, they killed the bacon game son!80/20 fat content just how I like my burgers, serious cheddar with a bite that'll make you recognize and respect the cheese.Sweetness and pepper of the bacon was game over.Double party definitely a plus, friendly people all around.Didn't do parking took LYFT, was too satisfied to notice their lot-situation.Foie gras scrambled eggs w/ Carmelized onion is un-mother-fckn defeated. 110-0 UNDFTD! Amazing meal"
"We FINALLY got in for brunch here after trying 4 times! Usually the wait is longer than we are willing to wait. I guess we were just more patient today. But anywhoooo, it was a yummy experience. The four of us ordered burgers, which were delish. No need to go on and on about it. All you need to do is read all the other reviews about how crazy amazing the burger au Cheval is! I have had other burgers in Chicago that were as tasty, so I wouldn't say this was the absolute best I've ever had....but it was certainly just as good as any other ""best"".We also tried the fries and that incredible aioli, the chilaquilles, and the salad. The chilaquilles was ridiculously yummy, as was the salad. I mean like, outstanding! So glad we finally were able to have the au Cheval experience."
"These burgers are some of the best I've ever had. They haunt my dreams, and my mouth started watering just writing this review. Thick cut bacon, egg on everything, and delicious fries. The cocktail menu is nothing to sneeze at either.Giving a place a poor rating because it is difficult to get a seat is the same as dropping your favorite band because everyone loves them now. Let's all get indignant over this injustice."
"Best burger in the country? Nah. It's decent, for sure good, but not the best among all burgers. I actually maybe wasn't able to enjoy it after the server we had Alice was just so uncaring and she just seemed tired and annoyed to be there, so that resulted in her being cold and a bit rude. I mean give this place a try, just know service might suck."
"Burger shmurger, the real gem here is the bone marrow dish!!!Of course we tried the burger (with egg) and yes, we enjoyed it, but it's pretty simple and I prefer burgers with interesting toppings or meats. This burger has 2 thin patties, where I prefer a thicker, single juicy piece. Next was the bone marrow dish with beef cheek marmalade. 3 giant bones, 1 extra deep, all perfectly buttery with just enough salt and pepper. The marmalade did not taste distinctly of beef checks, but a rich and slightly sweet flavor that ideally cut through the marrow's butteriness. All this on slightly salty buttered thick toast, with a few parsley leaves is TO DIE FOR. And all that for $18!! Such a great deal for such a generously portioned dish. Pairs very well with the extensive and interesting beer selection."
"We went to Au Chevel on a Saturday night. Been here at least a couple dozen times for dinner, lunch & brunch   and have the system down-  put our name in,  give the phone number to be texted when ready,  park the car and then visit all of the other bars,  and other  places in the area while you are waiting.  The best place to sit in my opinion is at the end of the bar which is the seat I request and will wait for,  from that vantage point you can listen to the music,  and watch the chef and cooks do the magic they do in creating a memorable meal.  They are having a great time and it is a good show.    Love the burgers, chieken & fries,  have tried all of the items on the menu.  Don' forget the chilaquilles if you are out late!  One of the best things to order and watch being made  is the Raw Salad-  root veggies quickly sliced on a mandolin with a dijon based vinaigrette dressing. Highly recommend getting that with your meal.   ."
"There is a reason why this place has absurdly long waits.  The cheeseburgers are as good they get. I have been here twice and got the cheeseburgers with all the fixing (fried egg, pork belly,etc.). Both times left me in awe and planning my next trip here. The price for the cheeseburger, if you get all the extra stuff, is slightly higher than most burger joints, but it is definitely worth it.  I have also tried the duck heart gravy hash and the roasted bone marrows. They were good, but nothing special. The cheeseburgers are special though."
"I attempted to go Au Cheval a couple of months ago for dinner, but the wait was 2 hours, so my friends I decided to go somewhere else.  After a failed attempt, I went today as soon as it opened at 11am and there was no wait!  Hooray!  My friend and I shared the single cheeseburger, crispy fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli and fried farm egg and general jane's honey-fried chicken with chili, sesame seeds and cilantro.  I was worried that the burger was overhyped, but luckily it was really good and exceeded my expectations.  The meat was perfectly cooked.  The service was great.  Our server suggested the chicken and I'm so glad he did.  My friend liked the chicken more than the burger!  I will definitely be back."
Absolutely love this place. Visited last year for Sunday brunch with a party of 4 and we had no wait at all. I ordered the crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy. Delicious. My coworkers and I came for lunch a few months ago and I split the hash and a burger with one of them. We all loved the burgers and the potato hash was as good as I remembered. The service here is always on point and the food comes out quickly as well. Prices are definitely reasonable given the quality and quantity of food. Will most likely be back.
"I went to Au Chavel last night with a friend. When we arrived there was a 90 minute wait which I wasn't too thrilled about... But, to pass some time we ran next door to the Lone Wolf for a few beers as Au Chavel was packed!. They texted us saying our table was ready about an hour later and we were seated almost immediately at a small table in the corner.The beer menu is a good one. I consider myself a well-traveled beer drinker yet I had heard of very few of the 30 beers on the menu. This allowed me to try something completely new! As for the food menu, it is a little sparse. There are a handful of sandwich/burger options and a few other things BUT I had been told that their burgers are incredible so I went with a single burger with a friend egg and a side of hashbrowns.When the burger arrived it looked amazing and my first bite did not disappoint either! The burger was cooked perfectly and it was as delicious and creamy and greasy and everything I could have ever imagined this burger to be! They didn't ask how I wanted it cooked and it didn't matter either because it was perfect in every way! I take that back. It came with pickles on it and I hate pickles... As for the hashbrowns, they were delicious too! I actually had to pick whether to finish the burger and leave half the hashbrown or finish the hashbrowns leaving half the burger. I opted to finish the burger...Overall, the burger is fantastic. It would be too bold of me to say this is the best burger in the City of Chicago but boy is it close! It's better than anything I have ever gotten at Rockit, DMK, or Kumas. I'll definitely be back for another someday but I might need to wait awhile as I'm still full from this meal. Five stars!"
"I'm giving it a 4 because there was a 2 hour wait to be seated because the restaurant itself is so small. There's maybe about 25 tables total. We went across the street to Haymarket pub for some drinks while we waited. Once we got the text saying our table was available, the service was great. It didn't take long to get our food. We ordered the single burger (which has 2 patties) with a bacon and egg on it. It was was delicious. Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  It definitely lived up to the hype."
"Good bar, great food a bit too much attitude/annoyances.  I get it, you're really popular right now, but our server had zero personality and seemed annoyed that we were even there.  On top of that:- we weren't' allowed to sit at a booth because we only had three of our four people there at the moment (if we're getting a booth why does it matter if one spot was empty... we would have had a booth if we said our party was three people only?)- we waited at the bar for 20 minutes before a server took our drink order (not a bartender)- our server once we sat down wouldn't let us split the check on more than one cardI love the food here, but not enough to put up with slow/poor service and we've had the technology to easily split bills between credit cards for decades."
"There isn't much to say about this place that hasn't already been said. It's one of the best burgers around. Get it as is, and add bacon and egg if you want. The bacon is extra thick. The hash browns are amazing and the smashed potatoes are even better; very rich. Service is great, ask for Ryan during the day. Tons of beer, great vibe. Go for lunch and miss the long waits. Late night? Good luck getting in."
"I mean it's the best burger you will get in the city. Not much more to say, besides make a reservation 2-5 hours in advance before going."
"Kumas, lockdown, leadbelly, all good dont get me wrong. But the best burger in chicago belongs to au cheval. Get it with an egg, bacon or just how it comes. Its all good.  Fries with the egg, super awesome.  Everything else on the menu looks unbelievable but i cant get away from the burger to try em.Expect to wait, at times you may catch a break and get seated within 10 minites or so. Be patient. Its worth it.  However, if its an extended amount of time put your name on the list and head next door to lone wolf. They will text you when you are close to being seated."
"I came to Au Cheval for one of my good friend's birthday and while I'm NOT a fan of waiting the time span of Titanic the movie to be seated at a restaurant...the 2 hour wait for was well worth it. The food was so good I had to lay down as soon as I got home because my stomach was full since I ate so much. The service was stellar as well.I'll be going back for sure and if you decide to hit upI recommend the following....- Toasted Open Faced Ham & Cheese Fondue with Fried Egg- General Jane's Honey Fried Chicken- Roasted Marrow Bones, Beef Cheek Marmalade & Toast"
This restaurant gets only 4 stars because the Bologna sandwich was much too salty. Other than that everything was amazing. The cheese burgers were so simple yet so flavorful! And I looooooove the fries with an egg on top. Mind blowing awesome! You really can't go wrong with garlic aioli sauce and fries (: I don't care for the other sauce. We had to wait 30-45 mins..... But we just walked around and explored Chicago since we were first timers in the city (: they take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. Bonus!!!!!
Good..  not great.  A basic thin patty burger with cheese and sauce that makes it messy to eat... and everything comes with fried egg.  Fries are extra but are good with the sauce.  A small crowded place tho.
Went for dinner here last Friday after work for a cheese burger. First I ordered A cheese burger and I got a double WTF if I wanted a double I would have asked for one it's like 5 guys. Second they put this white mayonnaise sauce on it and I think they should tell you that. The beer list is great the music is great.
"I've been here four times in the past year. The first three times were for brunch on the weekend and the last time was for dinner on a Tuesday night. If you want brunch, be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes. The plus is that they will ask you for your cell and text you when your table is ready so that you don't have to wait inside the (tiny) restaurant. Not that there's much to see nearby though... I usually head over to Northwestern Cutlery and look at kitchen supplies, haha.If you arrive for dinner right at 5 on a weeknight, you will have no wait. The brunch and dinner menus are more or less the same, so I would recommend dinner over brunch.The single burger is actually a double burger, and the double burger is actually a triple burger. Get the bacon -- so thick, so delicious. The fries with aioli sauces and au cheval (meaning with an egg on top) are delicious. One of the sauces is better than the other, but I'll let you decide which one. ;-)The bone marrow is better than the one I had at the purple pig. Bone marrow is actually relatively flavorless and so the strongly flavored cheek meat that came with it was a great touch. I recommend combining the two together to spread on your bread.I've never ordered the omelette myself, but my friend has gotten it twice. It's almost shocking how perfectly unblemished it comes out. Good comfort food. Things will be greasy. After eating here, chances are you'll be full for the day and never want to see food again. But trust me, give it a few days/weeks, and you'll be back for round two."
"We arrived Sat. night and was asked two things: do you have a reservation, and can I see your I.D. I then squeezed inside to leave my name. I was told by a woman who had to yell over the noise, the wait would be four and a half hours. Given it was eight PM we went somewhere else with the intention of calling for a Sunday reservation.I called Sunday and was informed they do not take reservatios. I described my Saturday experience and was informed rudely that they do not take reservatios.So my reaction is: this place is pompus, rude, and way too loud to have a relaxing evening. Not worth all of this for a hambuger, no matter how good. Next time I will just get out the grill."
I came back here sober yesterday and I really can't think of a place that has better burgers.Perfectly cooked and not so huge that I need to eat it with a fork and knife. No lettuce or tomato to get in the way of the meat and cheese but a little chopped red onion to enhance the flavor.Our waiter was super nice and knowledgeable. I had a the bloody Mary which was OK - I'm a spicy guy and didn't enjoy the sweet pickley flavor in the mix. It didn't help to see the bartender using her hands to put ice in the glasses. Someone please hand her an ice scoop or tongs!!!
"Not your average burger.  Worth the wait, and lives up to the hype!  Rich food, but not overwhelming.  If you order a burger, add the fried egg.  Drinks are original and damn tasty."
"Of course you're going to want something that's pleasing, but when you can't have it, you want it 10 times more, it's only human nature!  I've had Au Cheval bookmarked for quite sometime because of its much talked about foie gras scrambled eggs!  The sale of foie gras has been banned in California since July 2012.  I knew I was going to satisfy my craving here...no ifs, ands, or buts! I had thought that Au Cheval opened at 11am on Sundays but luckily we had our hotel's courtesy car drop us off early (we were gonna explore the neighborhood before opening) at 9:40am.  There were already three people in line waiting for doors to open at 10.  Finally open being seated I loved the ambiance of the restaurant and noticed how tiny it was.  There is bar seating but that's only for drinks and waiting.  I did not like however how loud they play the music and how tight the tables are next to each other.  We already knew what we were going to share, the foie gras scrambled eggs ($18) and the even more talked about cheeseburger ($12).  However, when our waiter came by, we didn't know yet what we wanted for a drink (decided on one OJ for him), so he said he would come back.  But he went around to other tables first and took their drink and food orders.  We were waiting for a little bit and then was able to flag him down and told him what we would be sharing.  A little while after, our waiter goes to the table to the right of me and gives the women there a few share plates, looks at us, then goes to the table to the left of me to give them share plates, and to the table to their left share plates.  Weird..and a little rude!  We finally asked a waitress for two small plates after we got our food.  The cheeseburger only came with one pickle and no fries or chips ($6 for a side of plain fries & $10 for fries with an egg and mornay sauce).  Their cheeseburger had two patties, though they were a little on the thin side, the burger was juicy & amazing!  The cheese was perfectly melted and their spread, was addicting!  It's sort of like a super light almost In-N-Out animal style sauce (but maybe not quite because I'm not a fan of animal style sauce).  My fiance is a burger fanatic, and he said if the patties were a little thicker, it would have made his like top 3 all time favorite burger list.  Those back in San Francisco, Nopa's amazing burger is still number 1 with Umami's burger trailing behind.  The foie gras scrambled egg was AMAZING!  Who would have thought to put this dish together?  The eggs were nice and fluffy and the foie gras was mixed with a dark sweet caramelized onion gravy.  I was afraid it was going to be overly rich, but it wasn't, it was just fatty like foie gras is and delicious!  Can scrambled eggs get any better than with foie?  It was also served with two pieces of Texas toast.  I loved it, and kept telling him how wonderful I thought it was, but he thinks it may have been because I was so hungry.Yes, we were tempted to go back late night, but it was about a 7 minute drive from our hotel, and I like how we were just able to wait 15 minutes early outside before opening.  I would think even pretty late at night you have to wait awhile, even if it was a week night.  I think what makes this a 4 and not a 5 was that service could have been a lot better, the BLARING music is not nice at all, and a little slightly overpriced for what you get.  If I'm ever back in Chicago I would definitely try to go back for brunch or dinner.  The restaurant filled up about 5 minutes after I got seated for Sunday brunch, so just get there before opening and you'll be ok."
"I have been dying to try this place for a long time but I left disappointed and sick. My partner and I waited a hour and a half for a table on a Monday night. OK, no problem. We went next door to Lone Wolf for a few drinks to pass the time.We had the bone marrow appetizer to split. He ordered the English breakfast (great choice) and I had a cheeseburger with bacon and egg. I woke up in the middle of the night feeling sick to my stomach. The service was great, loved the vibe but can't say I will be returning after throwing up all night. I would recommend Grange Hall or Burger & the Butcher over Au Cheval any day. Less hype, better quality food. Would recommend Au Cheval for a drink and appetizer if the bar was free."
"The no reservation thing is too bad - we were quoted 3 hours when we put our names in. Ended up snacking and drinking at Lone Wolf & RM Champagne Salon while waiting. Got a table after 2 hours, and ended up sharing food since we weren't starving. Awesome server: Erin. She was helpful and patient (we weren't drunk but we weren't sober), and it was appreciated.And the burger at Au Cheval? AMAZING. Just awesome. Fancy cheese made it unlike any other cheeseburger I've ever had. There's a single or a double - and the single is substantial. So good- and you know what? Worth the wait."
"You have to get here early to actually eat here. First time I went, it was little but after 1230 and the wait was 2 hours. So my friend I ended up eating at somewhere else. Second time we went, we got there right before they opened and there was 2 person waiting in front of us. We got seated by the window which was nice. the place got packed within 10 minutes. This tells you how good the food are! I had single cheeseburger with bacon and fried egg and it was so~~~~ good. I was thinking about getting double cheese burger at first because I was so hungry but single cheese burger itself is pretty big. With the fries, I was so full. I will definitely go back again!!!"
"I'll make this quick since I pretty much agree with all the positive reviews of this place.-Holy hamburger heaven!  Now this is what a burger should taste like!  Get the burger! you won't regret it!-Arrive early if you plan to go during the weekend - before it opens is ideal. If you don't, expect to wait-Good service-My bloody mary was okayI can't wait to go back!"
"We were told we had to come here by a friend we were staying with ( we are from out of town) and I'm glad I did. Now, I'm not the biggest burger fan, but this was delicious. I was told I needed to get it with the egg and bacon, but I don't like egg oneBurger and they have pepper bacon which I'm not usually a fan of so I got it without the egg and bacon and it was still so good. I tried the bacon and it was delicious. Pretty much like braised pork belly. It was thick and delicious. The wait was almost 2 hours but we walked around to kill the time so it wasn't too bad. A delicious burger well worth 5 stars. The rest of the menu looked wonderful as well. Our server was good. Very friendly and helpful. Only came to check on us like twice but we didn't really need anything so it was fine. And the place is small enough that if we needed him we could easily grab him."
"#toobusyforitsowngoodVisiting from out of town. 3.5 hr wait, drank in the neighborhood because it was supposed to be ""that good"" we got carded twice, once at the door and once during our drink order. Burger was good, not that good...not worth the wait or the service. Too loud and too dark."
Came here for lunch and had the burger a cheval. We also had a side of the fries with aioli and bacon. And beers. Several beers. The burger was amazing - got it with an egg and it came with some sort of dijonnaise (more mayo than mustard). The burger was amazing. The thick cut bacon was delicious. The fries were acceptable. And the beer selection was awesome. We didn't have to experience the wait since we got there around 11:30 and grabbed 4 seats at the bar. Go here. Eat a burger. Drink a beer.
"Only place really open past 10 that serves food in financial district of downtown. However, it felt like my fiancé and I were more of a burden then a customer. They are supposedly known for one of the best burgers in town, but the service is terrible. I understand they were busy, but when your waiting an hour for table and order a drink within 10minutes of walking in, and don't get it until you sit= The food was good (not amazing), but would have much rathered a better/ friendlier environment."
"Wait was over 2 hours on a Monday and guess what they couldn't guarantee seating even at 12pm. So we left a and came back at 9pm. 2 hour wait again and then 1 hour wait seating at the stools open for all that can't wait that long. Are u kidding me, for hamburger and fries? Sorry, not fooling anyone. Left for better, short wait, Chicago places which r many not to waste your night on like this one."
"Hands down among the best friend chicken I've had. Crispy, sweet. Must try.The burger was also excellent. While the food is very good, the wait and the service people are a nightmare. Be prepared to wait unless you go around 5p or 530p."
"I hate Au Cheval.... Let my clarify that last comment..... I hate Au Cheval because their burgers are sooooooo good and I have cravings for them every night! This place is amazing.They put a fried egg on everything which brings their food from an A to an A+I love their Fries, Burgers and Chilaquiles (only on the late menu)They are known for their Fried House-Made Bologna Sandwhich so I had to try this as well. Truthfully I was not very impressed and will not steer away from their burgers again.Why, oh why must you be open late with such Great Burgers Au Cheval? I can't say No to those burgers and fries (with fried eggs on both of course) so I guess I'll just have to be prepared to be 10 pounds heavier than I should be."
"About 9 years ago, I became an orphan. Since that time, I've had a lot of new experiences that..... Well, I can't share them with those who gave me life. And, that really breaks my heart. Because, after eating the cheeseburger at Au Cheval, all I could think about was..... I really wish I could bring my parents back to life, so that I could donkey punch them in the f@#+ing  throat for not telling me how good a burger could actually be. I would stab a kitten in the face for Au Cheval.... I would sell opiates to puppies for the money to eat here.... I would..... Well, honestly, I'll just keep working at my job for money that I can spend here. Crazy wait times from a year ago have gotten way crappier now. But, so good. The fries are Ok. But, don't let me forget to talk about that cheeseburger....."
"Simply amazing! Heaven in. My. Mouth. Go during lunch, the wait is not that long.  Staff is really nice too.  Splurge on your burger, add the egg and bacon. Their bacon is homemade and it's the best I've ever had....so thick and juicy.Come hungry! Top Chicago burger, if not, damn close. DMK is another favorite."
"The burger was good- but definitely not worth the wait (quoted us 2 1/2-3 hours on a Sunday eveningBurger alone was a 3 star- had better in LA- if you ever get a chance to experience an LA burger please visit Plan Check, you'll be blown away.Oh and the bacon on the burger.... that alone deserves 4 stars that was the highlight of the meal :)"
"I believe I've said the words ""no food is worth an hour+ wait"" and ""place doesnt live up to the hype"" quite a few times in previous reviews.  I take that back.  I take it alllll back!!!I'm not going to get into too much detail with this review because its pretty much all been said in the previous 1,200 reviews or so:Long wait, but worth it; and they will take your # and text you.Amazing burgers, must get the egg and bacon.Friendly staff.Amazing burgers.Small restaurant with a cool/simple atmosphere.Burger burger burger.Delicious spuds: fries, hash browns and mashed.Did I mention the burgers?  How about the bacon?Good beer and craft cocktail list.But in the end - its all about those burgers.Au Cheval is worth the wait, AND lives up to the hype.  I hate hate hate waiting for food but I would wait until Chicago was crime and corruption free for an Au Cheval burger.  That would be a really long wait, but its THAT good. Plus they'll text me..."
Not a ton to say other than they have a fantastic tap list that is overshadowed by even better food
One of the worst places I've ever been! 4 hour wait to sit at the bar over a hot grill for a mediocre burger and overpriced drinks. Definitely tonight recommend trying. There are much better burger places in Chicago:
"A staple of the Randolph corridor. Everything on the menu is great, people really like the burgers, the fries with and egg on top, potato hash, and others. Yes, this place is popular and doesn't take reservations. Come an hour before you would like to sit and either grab a drink at the bar or head down the street go Maude's for a specialty cocktail. There is an excellent draft beer selection and don't forget the pickle back Jameson shot."
"Given the fact that I'm a relatively young yelper, this reference may not catch everyone reading this. However, I'm gunna give this a go because it's the best possible way I can describe how I felt about the burger at Au Cheval.There's an episode of Spongebob when Squidward, the grumpy squid who works with spongebob at the local burger joint (The Krusty Krab) and hated everything in life except his clarinet, finally discovers how great krabby patties  (the restaurant's cheeseburgers) are. He takes a bite, and his eyes light up. Later that night, he heads to the restaurant and goes into the vault where all the krabby patties are located and just goes to town. Spongebob gets to work early the next morning to find Squidward finally embracing the wonder of the Krabby patty. Squidward ate every burger in the vault. Bottom line: if Au Cheval had a vault where it kept its wonderful burgers conveniently stashed, I would have broken into the restaurant that evening (just like Squidward) and eaten them all. For an illustration of this reference, search ""You like Krabby Patties don't you Squidward"" to get the full effect. Excessive childhood cartoon references aside, Au Cheval is a great establishment. A couple other points worth noting:1. You will likely have to wait. No reservation system here. 2. They have a nice beer list with selections from a wide array of local breweries. I highly recommend the Pullman Brown ale by Flossmoor Station."
"OK, so I have read many times that this place had the top rated burger in the city, so I decided to check it out. We got there at about 5 P.M. and it was already an hour wait to get a table. It wasn't surprising signed the area is pretty small. When you walk in, there is a narrow path to the end of the restaurant with about 20 tables squeezed in. There's also a bar that is set up like a traditional diner so you can see the cooks making the food. When our name was finally called, we sat down in a corner at the end of the bar so we had a great view of the cooks. I ordered an ""old fashioned"", which was extremely strong, but then again the menu labeled this drink a ""strong drink"". We then ordered a plate of fries, which we crispy and came with a sauce that was pretty much mayo, but I liked it.So for the burger, I would not officially put it as the best one I had, but it was pretty good. I ordered the double cheeseburger with bacon and received a triple cheeseburger instead. I wasn't too upset since the patties were thin. The burgers patties were cooked pretty close to medium rare, which I loved. Usually, patties that small are cooked well done, which kills the flavor, but not these patties. In an unrelated note, we saw the cooks preparing chicken wings and they were HUGE. When we come back, we will probably have those.Overall, I enjoyed the experience and will definitely come back."
The best! Worth the wait- they usually say 1.5 to 2 hours but I have never waited longer than about 45-50 minutes. Still crowded even at like 9:30- so just prepare to always have to wait. (No reservations). Not good for large groups. The burger with the bacon and egg is insanely good. Bologna sandwich is awesome and  I highly recommend ordering. Fries with egg and aoli-- just get them. no words. Cesar Salad- mmmthey have a great beer list as well as specialty cocktails- I had the Flapper which was refreshing and spicy (pepper). Very good (strong)! Come hungry- order everything
"Only came here once but it was pretty good... nothing outstanding though based on all the burger raving reviews. I got the burger, and we also got a side of bacon.The burger was definitely good, but it relied more on the sauce than the meat itself to add flavor. I believe the sauce was a twist off of a thousand island dressing type, but I don't think I would order the burger again since the sauce was overwhelming. The side of bacon was thick cut which was hard to distinguish it from just a cut of ham. I like crispy bacon but this was a bit more tender.I would probably come back here for other food, probably just not the burger again. You can always check in and go to a bar across the street while you wait - then they'll text you and you can come in and claim your seat. Worth checking out in my opinion."
"My husband and I went here for our anniversary. Let me just get this out of the way up front. You're going to wait. Ooooh boy are you going to wait. But, the wait will be worth it. You'll dive into a burger or the croque monsieur and you'll completely forget about how long you waited. You may be back the next day. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because you can't make a reservation, and dear Lord I love the ability to cut the line. I'll be back though waiting like everyone else, because really, it's worth it."
"Finally was able to try the burger for brunch. Can't say it was *that* much better than another burger I've had at other places in the city--but it was definitely delicious. The homemade pickled cucumbers on top were also great, and I enjoyed a good chocolate stout. Will definitely come back some time for brunch and/or dinner. A must try for any Chicago or out-of-town foodie. Dishes are all plenty large enough to share."
"So. freaking. good!!! I've been wanting to go to Au Cheval for the longest time. Trust me, it was definitely worth the wait. I tried going once before late night on a Friday and the wait was 3 hours. We went on a Thursday this time at about 9pm and we waited for about an hour to get seated. I had the double burger with egg. The only thing I disliked was how dark it was inside. There was a candle on our table but that wasn't enough to see menus."
"Saturday morning...before it was even opened there was a line waiting to get in. The place is small so if you want brunch on the weekends...get there a few minutes before opening...if not expect to wait. Are you a vegetarian? Then be prepared to have a very limited menu. I don't eat red meat so I was not excited about this place. Drinks: Ordered a Bloody Mary. My friend did not like it., but I asked them to tone down the spice, so I liked mine. The pickles were not Dill...but after awhile the taste grew on me. Food: Small Brunch Menu but  the burger looked amazing...everyone around me had one. I ordered the chilaquiles which happened to be meatless. They came with a good amount of guacamole. At first I didn't think they would be good...but WOW was I surprised. They were delicious. I highly recommend them. The portion was big and I ate them until I could no longer breathe. I have to admit I did not expect this place to have such good guacamole either. :-) My friends ordered the burger and English Breakfast. No complaints about the food! Service: The hostess was not very friendly but our waiter was. When we were seated so was everyone outside (it had just opened) so if you ordered right away your food would be right up. We took our time ordering so we had to wait a bit (we weren't in a rush so I didn't mind). So is this place worth the hype?...I think so!"
"Went on a Saturday night, the wait was 4 hours but it got cut out to 3 so we just walked downtown in the mean time. So when it was time to eat I was expecting the greatest favors in my mouth but it was not worth the wait, it was a good burger but not over the top omg deliciousness burger"
"Went with a friend right after work (5:30ish) on a Thursday and immediately got seated at the countertop/bar! Unheard of here apparently! It was starting to get busy though, so I wouldn't count on similar experiences. Cocktails are too strong and overpriced. I'd steal clear of them next time and order a beer or something more simple. The burger is amazing! I had it without a bun (low carb lifestyle) and added an egg (over medium) and bacon. The bacon was heavenly! Cheese was gooey and delicious. We discovered that you can order a hashbrown bun for your burger! Wtf?!? It was golden fried hashbrown goodness and looked amazing (we didn't actually have it, but you should!!)Fries with garlic aioli were awesome! We split an order and it was plenty. Burgers come without any sides. A single is two burgers and a double is three. Would love to try other menu items now that I can see the reviews are well-earned!"
"Another great brunch beginning where we came at just the right time! Sometimes the wait is worth it, but sometimes you just need to fill your belly right away. I loved the pickled garnish on my bloody, but the drink itself was a bit bland and not very strong. One friend opted for a mimosa and loved it. I wish I had gotten one instead but I'm on a mission to try every Bloody Mary in the city! And macarons, and sandwiches and pizza...The brunch menu is small, but the options all seem tasty. After eating vegetarian for a whole week, my meat cravings were outta control. Does that make me a part-time vegetarian? Anywho, the burger definitely lives up to the hype! I did get the egg and cheese so it was still pretty simple, but delicious. Not sure if the cute guy next to me was flirting when he commented that he had burger envy, but he probably changed his tune after witnessing my voracious eating and om nom nom sounds. I devoured the whole thing.....I also sampled the chilaquiles (delicious!) and a piece of my friend's thick, smokey bacon. It was by far the best pig byproduct that has ever graced my mouth. Next time my burger will be stacked with that bacon!"
"After hearing so many good things about this place, I finally got to try it on a Thursday for dinner. The wait was an estimate 1.5 hours and you put your name & number down and they would text you when a table is ready. I love this system because it gives you the freedom of exploring the neighborhood and local bars around the area. This neighborhood has a few bars nearby and lots of other yummy restaurants like Girl & Goat and Publican. My friend and I just walked around the block a couple of time checking out potential future restaurants to eat at. Before the 1.5 hour was up, we got a text that said our table was ready and boy, was it perfect timing because we were starving!We were both indecisive so we got the wings and the single cheeseburger with just bacon along with smashed potatoes and their famous fries w/ the egg on top.Wings: DELICIOUS. For $18, you get about 6-7 pieces of succulent, juicy chicken things, drumsticks, and wings. I love the marinating sauce, it was a mix of ginger and sweet/a little spicy flavor. I would definitely go back for just the wings.Burgers: We got a single with bacon on it and it actually comes as 2 patties. (The double is 3 patties). Overall, it was a mediocre burger. I have definitely had better tasting burgers that has much more flavorful patties. I was a bit let down by the burgers.Fries w/ egg on top: My friend and I were unsure of how to eat the fries with the egg so we didn't touch it at all. The aioli dip for the fries was delicious! I definitely like it more than the mornay sauce (more creamy and cheesy?) but my friend liked both. However, I don't know how I feel about $10 for fries, granted it was a lot of fries.Smashed potatoes: you can't go wrong with this. The gravy was pretty good!Total bill was almost $80 for the 4 items and a drink. It is a bit steep in pricing in my opinion for a burger bar/gastropub but I definitely would come back for their wings, that was the highlight of the night.The ambiance is a bit loud and very dim. I took pictures without flash and the lighting was horrible so I am not gonna bother posting pictures of my food on yelp. We sat at the bar and got front row seat to the kitchen area and it was cool seeing the chefs in action. They definitely work hard, so remember to tip well!Parking is valet for $12 for 4 hrs. You can try to find street parking but it will be hard so go pray to the parking gods to help you find a good spot!"
"I live dangerously close to this place which is dangerous to my health and wallet, visited a few times throughout the brunch hours and have yet to be disappointed (other than the wait). My usual go to is the Cheeseburger á Cheval single with bacon no fried egg (single is really a double and a double is a heart attack), split the fries with Mornay sauce, garlic aioli & farm fried egg.Last visit we were seated at the counter which I prefer because you are able to watch the cooks throw down in the kitchen and started small talk with the guy calling out orders and he hooked us up with the BEST Blueberry Muffin I have ever had, it kind of stole the show that day! Can't wait to come back to try items off the dinner menu and battle the 4-5 hour wait."
Came right at 5 pm and waiting only 45 minutes for our table!I love the chicken wings - they're spicy like a general tsao's chicken and super crunchy. If you're hungry or with a bigger group I highly recommend. Got regular fries and a single with bacon and they were both awesome! This place has a ton of hype but it's such a great burger and the staff is so incredibly nice and helpful. One downside last night - music was way too loud.
"Best Simplest Hamburger in Chicago Hands down. It melts in your mouth and since I eat gluten free. I cant have a bun but they put it on a hashbrown bun and it is magnificent. The bacon is so thick and perfectThe fries.. Oh the fries, best fries in Chicago."
"What can I say about the Au Cheval burger that hasn't already been said? It really is that good. I'm only giving 4 stars though because it is a little pricey and doesn't come with fries. You have to order (and pay for) those separately. The fries were good, and they come with a yummy garlic aioli. I still need to go back to try all the other delicious looking food!"
"I was so excited to finally try Au Cheval after hearing rave reviews form everyone I know. I really wanted it to be the heavenly hot spot that everyone spoke about but I was really not impressed. The burger was solid, nothing crazy, would gladly eat it but never wait in line again. Speaking of waiting in line, we were there about an hour before they opened and were 3rd in line. My friends were running late and they wouldn't seat us or even pretend like they were trying to save a 4 person table for our friends who were looking for parking. Even when they could see them outside near the back of the line, they wouldn't give us a table and instead chose to seat 2 people at a 4 person table (rather than the 2 person table next to it) as if to spite us for not all being there at the same time. Just when I thought all hope was lost and we'd have to wait an hour for the entire first round of tables to eat and for someone to leave, my friends managed to push through the line and they could no longer deny us a table (much to the hostess' chagrin). The chilaquiles were the worst I'd ever had, just a bunch of greasy chips and an over-salted mess. The baked goods were really the saving grace of this place and I appreciated the manager's attempt to apologize for the seating issue by bringing us a delicious muffin. I don't think I'd bother coming back, too many other great restaurants with excellent service that I'd rather give my business to."
"Went on a weekday at 11:30am and still had a 45 minute wait, so you know it's good! We got the chili and fries to split for the table. Delicious! But the real star was obviously the burgers. The buns are toasted on both sides, and the burgers was so incredibly juicy and perfectly cooked. I got an egg added, and it was EVERYTHING. Definitely lived up to its hype."
"Came here on a late Thursday night with a couple of buddies. One of them is a regular so he knew how to navigate the menu and drinks. The place was packed, but we didn't have to wait too long to get a table. The service is great. Everything comes out super quick - so much so that I held off on ordering a drink one time just because I knew it would come out fast. Great, extensive beer selection. Don't expect to find a 312 or anything from Revolution. They purposefully like to be different. I also had the old fashioned which was made perfectly. I didn't try the burger, but my friends (being regulars) knew exactly how they wanted it. I wasn't really paying attention to the details. They did say it's one of the best they've had in Chicago. I stuck with the Chilaquiles, a good non-meat option. They were delicious. The chips don't go soggy, and the toppings are piled high. They do get a little messy. They're prob better when you're drunk and not caring so much about that. I'll def come back since I feel like my foodie experience was a little incomplete."
"Good, but not worth the wait- Long wait - 2 hours~ Burger was solid, but Kuma's is better~ Foei gras was solid~ Strong cocktails"
The BEST burger in Illinois. Hands down. Make sure you get there a little early before their kitchen opens though. You don't want to be too far back in line.
Exellent burger!!!  The garlic aioli with the fries was out of this world. Could have dipped bark in it and the bark would be amazing.
"This place gets more hype than a terrible movie coming out on Christmas day. BUT, nonetheless, it lives up to it. The burger is single handedly (although I needed two hands to eat it) the best burger I've ever eaten in my life. The simplicity of it all really just blows me away. A simple burger with all the toppings I'd ever ask for.If you go, remember a few things, the single is a double and the double is a triple. So order the single burger and add as much bacon and eggs that pleases you. Settle in with a nice cold beer and a order of fries. Enjoy your meal and thank me later."
"Definitely make a stop here if you want some homey, irresistible, comfort food. Oh, and also if you don't mind having no greens in your dinner (do pickles count as a vegetable?) We started off with the honey fried chicken and yes it was delicious! Hot and crispy on the outside with the chili and light cilantro giving it a great kick. Then we made the ultimate decision of getting the double cheeseburger with a side of thick cut peppered bacon. I should've read these reviews before ordering because oh my god, I almost died (in a good way) trying to eat this. I did NOT know that it came with THREE patties. Besides from that surprise, this burger was melt in your mouth smooth. Even the bun with their spread of mayo was amazing (and I am not one to like mayo usually). Add on the juicy meat, egg, and bacon and it was like Christmas in my mouth. Unbelievable. Seriously the bacon is like the best thing ever so just get it, even if you don't like bacon. Get it.  Clearly this meal is not for anyone on a diet as I'm pretty sure my cholesterol spiked for a couple of days after and it might've brought me one step closer to being diagnosed with coronary artery disease. Still, no regrets. Come by early if you don't want to wait for long as the restaurant is very small and gets packed quickly. We stopped by on a weekend night around 6 and waited for close to two hours!"
"Au Cheval serves a burger that frequently contests for the best in the city. Their take on the burger is very interesting -- it's almost entirely meat. They've designed it to a simple, delicious perfection. Definitely get the burger with the egg and bacon on top if you can. The fries and garlic (truffle?) aioli are a standard -- and excellent choice --  to get with the burgers.The other dishes on the menu are quite good as well, as is the brunch menu. I don't think they're quite as good as the burgers and fries, but they still justify a visit.Finally, the atmosphere and music are a solid 10/10. No wonder the place is packed every night of the week."
"One word. WOW. This place is amazing. Plan on not getting in right away, but it is worth the wait. You get what you pay for, that's for sure. Service is amazing. Just eating here makes you feel like you are a part of pop culture ""hipster"" movement. Whether that's a good thing or not. Plan on not eating at all before you come though."
"This place gets 4 stars only because we had to wait an hour and a half.  Now, we were warned before going that it would take forever and a day to be seated, but it's never fun to wait that long.  Once inside, you can see why - it's very very small.  I'm talking look to right and to the left, do the hokey pokey, and you're done!  Fortunately, they take down your cell number and text you when your table is ready.  Onto the review... I noticed a lot of people ordered this huge burger with an egg on top.  While that looks fancy and all, I prefer my eggs on a separate plate.  So, I just ordered the burger with some fries.  The fries were definitely homemade and quite yummy.  The burger was...Yes, I just fainted... Sooooooooooo good!!!  Oh yeah, what made the burger so good was their sauce.  I don't know what's in it - some legalized form of crack - but you will be hooked!  Don't forget to transfer some extra funds into your bank account, because the price is a bit higher than the McDonald's Dollar Menu!Don't wait, just go.  As always, you can thank me later..."
"Knowing this place gets crazy busy we headed over right after work and snagged one of the last few remaining booths before they went on a wait.  They are certainly popular and there was a festive atmosphere for the most part.  The grumpy host was somewhat of an issue as he doesn't speak.  He just looked at us so we explained slowly that there would be 2 of us.  Thankfully that is where our interaction with him ended...dude should find a new job and not in the service industry.We both got the cheeseburgers which you probably already know are fantastic.  I added the bacon which also is very good.  Our server was fun and had us in and out of there in no time which was appreciated.Yes, it is one of the best burgers in Chicago and I am sure we will be back at some point.  Just watch out for Mr. Grumpy, if you have to deal with him know it will only be a limited time."
"We've tried coming to this place a couple of time now.  Each time, an unreal waiting time.  The third time was the charm.  We came a little before 5 and were seated right away.  Perfect timing too because that's when the kitchen opens, according to the guy that seated us.  On our way out, you can already see the people waiting. It's best to come early, otherwise expect a VERY long wait.  The place isn't very big, but has a charming rustic tavern decor with old school hip hop jams. When you walk it it feels pretty intimate. It's a great place to chill and sip libations.  The booths look very luxurious and I like the tables and chairs, it really feels like I'm in a tavern, but modern day. If you sit at the counter you get a great view of what's cooking.  Next time, I think I'll opt for a seat at the counter to watch the action. We ordered general jane's honey fried chicken with chili, sesame seeds & cilantro.  It was pretty tasty.  It reminded me a lot of Korean fried chicken, but less crispy.  This isn't the the kind of fried chicken you get with chicken and waffles.  It's the saucy type of chicken like the chicken wings you get at Yardhouse.  It is also a tad pricey.  In the future, I probably would not order this.  I just wanted to try it because I was curious.  You have to like chili and asian flavors to truly appreciate this dish.  We also ordered the single cheeseburger.  With a single, you get two patties.  The patties are actually pretty thin, so the two patties is like one real patty.  They also have this relish mayo that is actually pretty tasty and the pickles too.  The bread is nice and soft with a delicious butter toast.  A bit on the greasy end, but manageable. If you have ever been to Apple Pan in Los Angeles, the burgers here are similar to those with the exception that it's a bit fancier and bigger here.  I would probably order a burger in the future with an egg.  Now, you can't have a burger with fries.  Thus we opted to try the crispy fried chicken with mornay sauce, garlic aioli & fried farm egg.  This is why we didn't add the egg to our burger. I personally did not like the fries.  It must be the oil they were cooked in tasted unpleasant to me.  I never had an egg with my fries so I had to give this one a go.  It wasn't bad at all, not quite gravy like, but just sauced up.  The mornay sauce was cheesy and the garlic aioli was money.  If not for that garlic aioli, that dish would have been lost to me.  Overall, I had a gastronomic experience.  Our waiter was helpful and friendly.  I really enjoy the hip hop sounds and am glad I got to check this place out.  Remember, get there early to nab a seat and to prevent the long wait times."
"OH MY GOD. NOM NOM NOM. HOW CAN A BURGER TASTE THIS HEAVENLY?!?!? You need to try the burger with the egg. You can't request to get it well done, medium, or etc....They have their own special way of grilling burgers, and clearly, they know what they're doing.We also ordered the fries with garlic aioli -- delicious. But the game changer with the hash with duck heart....omg, so good....you need to order it!! Came here with my 3 friends and waited for about 35 minutes on a Thursday evening...but the wait went by quickly thanks to the great list of cocktails available.I need to come back here again, and if you haven't been here yet, come now."
"Soooo trendy, great music, AMAZING BURGERS in a relaxed, but smaller spaced   Location. FEELS welcoming, and special. I love coming here! I recommend early afternoon or after 10:30pm. Always crazy, always a 40min + wait- no reservations either."
"Been there twice on Tuesday, both times worth the hour long wait. Just go have a drink next door in the meantime. It's like a diner but for the cool kids. It's dark with loud music, and candle lit (but not in like a romantic kind of way). Got the burger, highly recommend adding egg and bacon. Skip the mashed potatoes but you MUST get the fries, yum!"
"This place is just awesome.   As of November 2014, it's the best burger I ever had.   ServiceWe came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and the wait was going to be long.   However the host was able to quickly get us a spot so that was awesome.   The servers did a great job of checking up on us and most importantly our food came out pretty quickly.   FoodFries - they were OK.   I could live without it actually.   Au Cheval Cheeseburger with bacon - OMG!   This thing is flat out amazing.   The burger pattie was nice and tender.   The bacon melts in your mouth but is expensive at $9.   However they give you bacon straps... Not strips because it is so thick.  Lol.  LocationThe place is kinda small.   We took an uber ride from downtown to get here and I would suggest you come early otherwise the wait is going to be bad."
"Sitting here on a barely cushioned bar stool with my back aching and head pounding from the bass, I cannot help but start my review.  I don't know if much, even an incredible burger can turn this experience around.   I wanted to take my husband somewhere different for his birthday. He loves burgers. So here we go....First, hour wait.Second, seat at the bar.Third, the next people who got sat, got a table.  (If you would have told me, I would have waited.)Fourth, sorry, I forgot...I just got hit in the back with something or another...Fifth, they are currently filming check, please! and there is a huge camera three inches from my head...I'm sure the food will be good...but honestly, that doesn't matter after the experience I've had so far.  I will never be returning, even if it is the best meal of my life."
"Everyone raves about the burger, which is amazing, but there are so many great items on the menu. The Duck heart is my favorite and something worth trying. The place can be tough to get into around lunch time or in the evenings."
"It is not often that food lives up to the hype, but the burger at Au Cheval not only lived up to it but exceeded all my expectations.  I have at least 5 people tell me how Au Cheval's burger was the best out, and I have to agree with them 100%.  The only downside to getting a burger here is that I haven't had a burger since because I know it will just be disappointing.  I cant wait to go back."
"Hands down the best burgers I have ever had. Sometimes the wait can be a bit long, but well worth it!"
"I'd heard good things about this place but left not really understanding the hype. The food was ok I suppose. I had a double burger, and my girlfriend had an omelette with mushroom, kale, etc., which she seemed to enjoy more. We ordered fries that were solid. The place is a bit tight and I felt a bit too close to the people at the next table. It was pretty loud as well. Also, I thought the prices were a bit out of hand. I assumed it would be more than your standard place, but for what we got, I thought the price was a bit ridiculous."
"Tried Au Cheval for the first time on a Wednesday night and the wait was still over an hour! This place was packed, but well worth the wait! Had the single cheeseburger with bacon then split the crispy fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli  & fried farm egg, and mashed potatoes & roasted garlic gravy. Burger was cooked to perfection and the sides were so amazing, especially the garlic aioli for the fries. For wine I had Pinot Blanc/Pinot Gris which was one of the best white wines I have tasted. It was so good that when I got home I searched where I could buy it in Chicago."
"The hype is real with this place. I didn't expect to have as good of an experience and I did since it just comes off as this hipster, slightly pretentious restaurant with the ""best restaurant you will ever experience you life"" kind of attitude.But man. They sure did deliver. Let's start with what everyone is talking about - the burger. Yeah, it's a damn good burger. Everything about it is perfect. Perfectly cooked, great bun, beyond flavorful. The pickled cucumbers on the burger (is that what they were?) really made it for me. It just added this extra crunch and flavor that took it to the next level. It would be hard to come back here and order anything else.And the single reason why you absolutely need to come here for brunch is the foie gras and scrambled eggs. Freaking heaven on a plate. First of all, I love foie gras. It's god's butter. It's amazing. And when I was living in California it was banned for the last several years, so you can imagine how disappointed I was. And now I live in Chicago where I can get it any time of day. Yes, this dish is $18. And it's worth every penny. I would pay more than that for this dish. It was just so, so good. And the toast they serve with it is delicious. I haven't stopped thinking about it since.I did attempt to go back to Au Cheval to indulge again. But the wait was 2 hours. I mean...this place is good...but it's not wait for 2 hours good. I don't think anything is wait for 2 hours good. Hopefully I catch them at an off time again...because, I mean...foie gras and scrambled eggs. And possibly the best damn burger you will ever eat."
Best burger in the world. So good that the long wait is completely worth it.
"I wanted to give 5 stars but it is a bit too dark inside for my liking. There is always a long wait so come before dinner time or after. Also, their seating situation is horrid. If you come with more than 4 people, prepare to squish your tooshes into a booth meant for two.  I've only tried their burger and fries. I've tried the single (which is actually 2 patties) cheeseburger with egg and bacon but I prefer it with only bacon. The bacon slices are so thick and succulent, they have some sort of maple glaze to them that make them a bit sweet. They are peppered too so it has a nice little kick. A tip for yelpers: order a side is bacon instead of having them on your burger and share them amongst your friends. If you order it on your burger they give you one or two, but the side has about 5 or 6 slices. Yum yum.Onto their fries, try it with a Fried egg and garlic aioli. They are yum. I would say two people can share one order. Overall, I crave their burgers often.. A must try for Chicago locals and visitors!"
"The burger is delicious, that's really all there is to it. I got it without the egg or bacon - it doesn't need it.If waiting makes you mad, come right when they open. More than 30 minutes after that and you will have to wait (really - I used to work down the block and we checked during lunch a few times). But, since you know you're going to have to wait ahead of time (which you should since you're on the yelp page), it's not a big deal -- go enjoy a Zombie Dust at Lone Wolf and wait for the text saying your table is ready."
"So worth the wait. They don't take reservations. We waited almost 3 hours last Friday night for my dad's birthday and everything was amazing, including the service."
"I want to write this review, but all the blood in my brain has moved to my stomach to digest the best burger I have ever eaten in my life. This is crack."
I met a friend for lunch on the Monday after easter. Was pretty packed but not a long wait. Grabbed seats at the bar where a server waits on you not the bartender! We ordered both of their gin cocktails the  flapper was delicious! I ordered there single patty burger with thick juicy bacon and a fried egg. HEAVEN. Ive been to most great burger joints around chicago. This was by far the best burger I ever had the pleasure to enjoy. Perfectly cooked (finally!) cheese was nice and melted even the bun was good. Order there fries on the side they are exceptional as well. My friend got the matzo ball soup very flavorful! Even there coffee was good and local! Not great for big groups id say any more than 6 you will wait a while. There was a line when we left.  Big recommend while in chicago or just for some good food!
Not too shabby.  Bologna sandwich was just ok...
"With all the other reviews to read, this will be short and sweet. The place is so loud, it lost a star (but I'm over 30+).  Otherwise perfect!  Cheeseburger, bacon, fries, root beer, chicken livers, fried chicken, and many interesting menu items make this a must."
I had heard about this place from everyone saying you must try it. The burgers were amazing. Nice thin hamburger patties and the white sauce to dip your fries in as amazing. Very long wait depending on what time you go is the only downside
"For sure the best burger in Chicago!  The cheeseburger is so juicy and flavorful, and with the added SLAB of bacon and a fried egg on top it's perfection!  The price is also not too bad for what it is.  A single is actually a double and a double is actually a triple.. So for an average dude who usually eats a fair amount of food, a single is perfect.The fries with egg and the hash browns with duck heart gravy are good compliments, but if you eat too much of it it takes away from the beauty of the burger.The seating can be a bit cramped if you're looking to dine with 5-6 people (its 6 max and its a little bit of a squeeze).  The wait on a friday or saturday for dinner can be really long.  You can put your name down and go grab a few drinks at the bars nearby and they will text you once the table is ready.  The shortest I've waited was 30 min and the longest was 2 1/2 hours."
"I came to visit some schmuck I was dating that lived in Chicago. He's gone, but my love affair with Au Cheval will live on forever. And guess what?!? Now I live in Chicago and can go whenever I want (sans schmuck)!Before I even lived here I went to Au Cheval every time I visited Chicago. Every. Single. Time. Here's why: that burger is flipping amazing. I've been for dinner, brunch and lunch and I've ordered it several times. It's always great. The BACON!!!! It's heaven. I'll also tell you I had the best matzoh ball soup and blueberry muffin I've ever eaten. Everyone I've ever gone with has enjoyed their food as well. You will probably have to wait to get in and be seated, but I promise you it's worth it. Service has always been prompt and friendly.This place is a gem!"
"The duck confit is a must there! Burgers are great there too! Delicious and rich. The place has a good balance of the bar and dining environment. If you're in the west loop area, you definitely should go and try it!"
"Used to be 5 stars but the idea of waiting in a 2.5 hour line to enjoy this place is a little infuriating.  It's nice that they'll call you when your place in line is next but When you visit from out of town and have to take an Uber there, and there is no where else to kill time at, I'll just go eat somewhere else and try to go again if I ever visit on a Wednesday."
"Believe the hype. This is truly the best burger in America. For the best balance, go for the single (which is really two 4oz paties). Perfectly seasoned prime beef grilled to a perfect medium with american cheese, some incredible house made bacon, a gooey sunny side egg. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.What else could you want? Fries you say? Go for the luxurious version topped w/ a fried egg, mournay sauce and garlic aioli... You won't regret it."
"I got the double cheeseburger (which has 3 meat patties on it, so if you want 2 meat patties then just order the regular one). I added bacon (which was $3.50) and an egg (which was $1, I believe) and the add ons definitely were not worth the cost. The egg made the burger really messy and difficult to eat. The bacon was definitely not for me.. it was thick cut and no way worth $3.50. I went a little before 12pm on a Monday and sat at the bar. If you go during lunch hour and want a table-- prepare to wait... if you try to go after 5pm or on a weekend.. prepare to wait longer. It was a good burger though, although the price was a bit excessive. If I went back I would just get the regular burger and not add the egg and bacon."
"The Way A Burger Should Taste!A West Randolph burger joint that stands alone for it's rustic charm, great music, friendly & upbeat energy... and some Kick A-- burgers, fries and pickles that will have you talking about them until you can get our next fix!We were so impressed, on our first visit, that  we brought 3 meals back for our doormen. They've all trekked back across town, at different times, to get what they say are the best burgers they've ever eaten. No argument from me. Give them a try and tell me what you think.Burger Up!"
"My fiancè & I were excited to try the ""best burger in the city"" as for the experience it is as follows: 1. Long wait (we were ok with that) 2. Small & a tad crowded 3 the music is insanely loud. Seriously bring an Advil. 4. The food was.... Delicious. Truly very good. Overall it's a little overpriced and the music is terribly loud but the food is on point."
"I'm a sucker for anything with a fried egg on top... so naturally, this place ranks pretty high up on my list. Seriously... their fried egg is made to perfection. No joke.I ordered the 'Single' Cheeseburger with, yes, a fried egg on top. Delicious! Let me warn you that 'Single' means TWO burger patties (not one). So a 'Double' actually comes with THREE burger patties. This isn't very clear on the menu but hey... it's more food so I had no complaints.I also ordered 'Crispy Fries' on the side which also comes with... a fried egg on top. Amazing! I'm pretty sure you could order basically anything on the menu with a fried egg on top--highly recommended."
"I would say their cheeseburger was probably the best quality meat I've ever had on sand which. The flavor was absolutely delicious. Make sure to add on either an egg or some bacon. I chose just bacon and it was ridiculously thick and tender. The fries were very expensive and just ok, but the garlic aioli sauce was almost drinkable. So delicious! Make sure to get their in good time, because the wait can be extremely long. Huge list of craft beer though, that is very delicious."
"Definitely worth the wait !!!  I would never imagined I would wait that long for a burger, but it was highly recommended to me by my sister-in-law law and she is one of the most inpatient persons I know.  I would wait twice as long even to just get a bite off of a strangers burger.  The atmosphere is great too.  An all around must go to place.!!"
"After trying Au Cheval multiple times, I have finally perfected my personal order for their great burgers. 1. Double Cheeseburger with Eggs -- The double cheeseburger actually has three patties. The eggs go perfectly with the beef, as it adds a different element of juiciness. I would never have imagined that yolk would go so well with a cheeseburger before I tried Au Cheval. 2. Side of Bacon -- Make sure you ask for a full side of bacon ($8), not just a side of bacon for the burger (only two small pieces). I have found that the standard side of bacon for the burger is simply not enough; the three patties of beef significantly overpowers the bacon, and you are left for more pig. In summary, don't just get a double cheeseburger with eggs and bacon. Take the bacon out of the burger and ask for a full side of it. If you do that, you will have (at least in my opinion), the perfect burger order at Au Cheval."
"So, I'm not sure what the hype is all about being the 'Best Burger in Chicago' or 'The Biggest Bigger'. But, it seems to me that everyone walks in here is because 'they heard it's a must do.' Smaller place, don't take reservations, and even on a weekday winter cold night at 6:30, my friend and I had a 30 minute wait, so it was more like 15.  Some of the bar seats do full service, so if you're okay with that, let the host know. Even with a wait, you can walk out and come back, they will just text you. Looking at other reviews before I came in, I guess you can order special requests, but our waitress, who was nice, and busy, but seemed like she wanted to be off the clock, never gave us any details about the menu. We ordered burgers, which to me, was too salty. And it came with American Cheese. The best part was the fried egg. It's a fun bar setting, not too loud, very chatty. Different dynamics of people, first dates, to guys night out, to a mom and her son. Sitting at the bar was fun watching the cooks prepare the meals. Beer list is great too. If you're in the neighborhood, walking down Randolph, and you can find a seat at the bar for a beer, great! Maybe even get the french fries. Otherwise- if you like good burgers, go for big patty's, fresh ingredients, and real cheese over to any other steak restaurant. We weren't rushed, we had a good time, stayed for an hour and half, and next time I go back, I may order a salad, heard those were good, and that is, if I go back."
"I'm not even certain my heart is ready to give this review, as I'm still emotionally connected to my evening here the other night. In the least (most) dramatic fashion, I'll try to recount my experience at Au Cheval --- aka: The Mother Ship (of Burgers).Like folklore, I was told of a place where burgers were better than you could dream, and this seemed lofty, considering I dream about them a lot already. The use of the phrase ""best burger in..."" is thrown around like a child's new toy. It's shiny at first, but begins to look and feel like the others. It's a fleeting experience and the high never matches the anticipation. Well, I'm here to tell you that this high is laced with something different.The burgers here are amazing. Melt-in-your-damn-mouth amazing. The wait? 2 hours. I never believe anyone when they say you're going to wait a long time, but since Au Cheval is not about lies, it was truly 2 hours. It's no big deal. You're not exactly in a food or drink desert, so just go grab a drink or two and wait it out. When you finally do get your table, you'll be surprised that your burger (assuming you order this, and why wouldn't you?) will come in 10 MINUTES! It's equal parts annoying and satisfying. Somehow you want to understand how a place that makes you wait 2 hours for a table doesn't take ridiculously long to create their food, but on the same hand, you've waited for 2 hours, so you're not sure if you should be concerned, excited, or just confused. Assuming you're in the latter two, your experience will soon be masked with beef ecstasy. Get the double. Why are you there if you don't? They pretty much don't let you alter the sandwich, or if they do, they don't encourage and / or advertise the possibility. But, much like a drug dealer, you take what you get. The meat (not ironically used) is slightly sweet with the perfect amount of salty cheese. To be honest, I'm not even certain what was on my plate at this point because after my first hit, I mean bite, I inhaled the sandwich and accompanying fries in a blind fury that could only be witnessed by those with a strong stomach. Have you ever seen Jaws?Anyway, the prices are great. You would think for as ""classy"" of a diner as this is that you'd pay out-the-ass for this experience, but I assure you that you and your wallet will be happy. Also, you should drink some booze and essentially do whatever they tell you. After consuming, what I believe to be the second coming on a plate, I would've walked across the Sahara* had they insisted.I've gotten off-track, but essentially my review should just read: ""Eat here. Now.""*It should be noted that this could be due to that fact that while the burger was as amazing as described, it's possible that beef prepared in such a way instantly clogs both heart and brain vessels and could lead to mind-altering choices, such as signing up to walk across the Sahara. **I'm not certain if I missed anything here, such as drinks available, service, etc., but it wasn't necessary to even mention. The server was wonderful, and frankly, E.T. could have taken our order and I would've eaten the burger with the same voracity."
"Loved the ambiance here, the music is loud but you can still have a nice conversation without screaming.I definitely recommend the ROOT BEER!! I'm not typically a fan of it was but dang, it is some really good stuff. General jane's fried chicken- too salty in my opinion but it's good fried chickenSingle cheeseburger- it's huge and delicious especially with the thick slice of peppered BACON and fried egg!Fried house-made bologna sandwich- I like how thinly sliced the bologna was, I definitely recommend thisFrench fries- served with aioli sauce...*drooling*"
"When you come to Au Cheval be ready to grab a drink at a restaurant nearby because the wait is worth it, Besides the outstanding burgers, delicious bone marrow and spicy chicken, the atmosphere is great. Sitting at the counter, I loved watching the staff that seemed to enjoy working there."
"Yeah, the burger is legit. Yeah, the service can be hit or miss. I am somewhat torn after a few experiences. I think the law of diminishing returns has kicked in for me. I've enjoyed the burger with egg & bacon, fried chicken, bologna with bacon, and the sides to go with. It's almost magical the first time you have a run-in with Au Cheval. I can say you won't be disappointed from the food to the atmosphere.I likened the burger experience to that of enjoying an old fashioned. You let it arrive at the table, stare at it for a minute, creep your nose in for a whiff and just sit back. Take a few sips, or bites in this case, and just let it marinade. Let it mature and dive back in. It gets better as the time passes.My most recent encounter left me a bit confused. I came hungry and buzzed on an empty stomach which was not a great move in hindsight. I may have interrupted the waitress for a drink in a rude way but sincerely apologized. I was at fault. At that point I surrendered but there was nothing I could to make up for it. I was in the dog house the rest of the evening. While ordering I got the ""let me check with the chef"" to confirm if we can do it your way. Rubbed me the wrong way. And there I sat with the check near a c-note and not feeling the whole experience was  worth the hard earned coin. Maybe it's just me, maybe it's my opinion, but I will approach with caution next time."
"Great food, unbearably loud music."
"Au Cheval...you do not disappoint and actually live up to the hype!  I waited for less than an hour on a Monday evening which isn't too bad considering they typically have a long wait.  They took our name and number down so that we didn't have to wait around, and my friend and I went across the street to grab a drink at Haymarket Brewery.  Here are my thoughts and comments about dining at Au Cheval!1. (Random note) Au Cheval directly translate to horse in French...interesting. 2. The burgers are as good as everyone says.  Are they THE BEST EVER?  I'm not sure about that but I can say they are outstanding!  I had mine topped with an egg and thick cut peppered bacon.  The single cheeseburger like everyone mentioned actually comes with 2 patties.  Why they didn't call it a double and the double a triple??  I'll never understand!  The patties were thin but not overly thin and were very tender and juicy. The egg was cooked perfectly with the yolk having the right amount of runny-ness and the bacon was thick, fatty, and melt in your mouth tender.  YUMMMY! 3. If you like garlic aioli, definitely order the fries since that's the sauce they serve it with.  I thought the fries were perfectly prepared but my friend thought they were too salty...so beware if you don't like salty fries.4. The ""Sweet leif"" beer is pretty darn tasty with a complex taste.  It's a ""local option"" that is brewed with sencha green tea and you can actually taste the green tea when drinking!  When you first take a sip it tastes like your typical beer, then the green tea flavor hits you, and THEN there's a sweet aftertaste.  Highly recommend if you like beer and tea!5. Service was mediocre, our waiter checked on us only a few times throughout the meal and when we were ready for the check he was no where to be found.  This isn't a big deal to me but it would have been nice if he had been around just a tad bit more.Overall, Au Cheval is the bomb and I can't wait to come back and try other things on their menu as well as their brunch!  Don't be scared off by the wait time since the food is definitely worth waiting for.  There are plenty of bars/restaurants up and down Randolph Street for you to grab a drink at while you eagerly wait in anticipation for their text!"
"What can I say that someone hasn't already said, however, the experience was amazing.We arrived at 11:00 am and proceeded to begin our eclectic food experience.  Ryan our waiter was outstanding his recommendations were spot on!  The food is over the top and I will dream about the bone marrow   I cannot wait until I come back again.  Best burger in Chicago!"
"I'd heard that Au Cheval's burgers were the best in the midwest, which led to some pretty high expectations going in for my first time. Yet, Au Cheval did not disappoint. They gave me what may have been the *best* burger I've ever had. I requested a double cheeseburger with bacon and surprised when they brought out a monster with 3 patties and slices of bacon that were probably 1 centimeter thick. Yowzas! It was delicious... and the fries were good, too."
"Came here on a sat night after work around 1 and it was packed.  Ordered the single cheeseburger (it's actually a double) added the thick cut peppered bacon and fried egg, French fries and a whisky drink.  Basic drink, it was packed so can't blame them but the food took a while and it was extremely salty.  I'm pretty sensitive to salt but it was overwhelming.  I was pretty tipsy tho so I ate it and didn't mind too much but totally regretted it the next day.  For a $22 dollar burger defiantly not worth it but happy I got to try it!"
"Cheeseburger heaven. I know Au Cheval has many other items on their menu, but my brother brought me here just to try the burger while I was visiting a few weeks ago. There was a wait, but we were able to put our names in, go down the street for a beer while we waited and then they called us when a table was available. Plus, our table had an awesome view of the Chicago skyline. This place is a can't miss in Chicago!"
"The kitchen opens at 5pm for dinner so if you come in later you might have to wait a while to be seated. The space is not that big.I came here with a friend and we both got the single cheeseburger with a egg and fries. The fries were crispy and was served with aioli. I liked the cheeseburger and adding an egg to it was a good choice because it tasted so much better than just your regular cheeseburger. I'm not usually a burger person, but this was a good burger. One thing is eat your burger fast while it's still warm; otherwise, when it's cold, the burger will taste really salty because of the cheese."
"Their burger was definitely a must have item. We had it with thick-cut bacon and egg. We also shared general Jane's honey-fried chicken with chili, sesame seeds & cilantro and fries. It was a lot of food for two of us. I would definitely like to go back and try some other items."
"Food was good, burger was tasty but basic. However, with the reputation of the place, the long wait and the high prices I expected more."
"Having been here three times now (a going away lunch for a close friend, a treat for a co-worker, and my own going away lunch from my last work place) I'm long overdue for a review of Au Cheval.  And if you can't tell already, I'm definitely a fan!Environment:  Definitely a hipster scene to the place in terms of decor and staff.  The music tends to be loud, so it's a bit harder to talk, but typically you can adjust pretty fast.  Not the ""romantic date"" night spot, but if you don't mind a more energized scene, well worth it.Service:  Friendly staff, kept the water flowing at all times without being intrusive, and happy to explain/recommend items on the menu.  Have to say, great staff here!Now onto the food:General Jane's Honey Fried Chicken - These are the ever popular ""lolipop"" chicken wings with the tendon cut and the meat pushed up.  But that perfect crisp along with excellent sauce makes it really quite delicious.  A great appetizer to share, but it could likely serve as a light lunch on it's own.Omelette:  Easily the richest omelette I've ever had.  Perfectly formed, very velvetey/buttery, I've never had an omelette quite like this before.  Worth checking out if you're doing paleo, and if you're an omelette fan, but otherwise, the main feature here is really their burger...Single vs Double Cheeseburger:  Much like Five Guys, the labeling is deceiving.  THe single is actually a double, and the double is actually a triple.  Order accordingly.  And since this was voted one of the best burgers in Chicago, this is the main reason I went to check this out in the first place...  And I have to say, it did not disappoint.  The burger was flavorful, the bun was just right, it's cooked properly...  This is a great burger.  Optionally, you can add a fried egg (which will leak all over the burger adding ridiculous richness) and bacon to the burger for an upcharge.  I personally thought it was well worth the upcharge.Mille Feuille:  If you've saved room for dessert, this might be worth checking out your first time here.  Interestingly, compared to the very rich food you just had, this pastry feels light and easy (though don't be fooled, I have no doubt tons of butter and fresh cream grace this recipe).  Shatteringly crisp layers of pastry with fluffy cream between each layer, the only thing that's truly light here is the flavor, and it becomes somewhat hard to appreciate how great this is after all the powerful rich flavors of what you just had on the menu.  It's a great dessert to try, fun presentation (6 inches tall!) and tasty on it's own, but after  a strong flavored meal, the flavors dull a bit in comparison.  Still, enjoyable!Verdict:  Excellent well thought out food, great service, hip ambiance... very tasty stuff indeed.  My only complaint is that the one time I went for my going away party during lunch, I had called ahead two days in advance to ask if it would be alright to have a table of 8 seated, which they claimed no problem.  Upon on arrival, they weren't willing to seat a table of 8, and instead split us into two tables of four, even though they had a few tables that were available right next to each other...  confusion amongst staff?  But overall, I'd definitely come back, and looking forward to bringing the wife here for a late night meal... they're open until 1:30 AM!!!"
"Hands down the best burger in Chicago! To go along with the burger, the fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli and a fried egg are excellent. I would also recommend a side of the thick cut peppered bacon. All in all this place is great but I would get there early for lunch if you don't want to wait. If you do have to wait, trust me it is well worth it."
"Amazing food, can't say enough good things about this place. A ridiculously good burger, great service, sweet atmosphere."
"Favorite burger in chicago- runny egg, premium beef and lots of good grease = amazing.  Have a friend wait for 3 hours then u can get a table (maybe).   They should open another location."
"Great atmosphere, music, food. Four stars due to lack of free parking and long and I mean long wait."
"Incredibly overrated burgers. I went on a busy Sunday for brunch and felt like I was being rushed out. Besides that, the service was okay. It's loud, you have to wait in line to get in. It is what it is."
"Oh people of Chicago!  I weep thinking of how packed this place is and how impossible it is to get a table for such below average fare.  Chicagoans know good food.  But frankly, based on the reviews for this restaurant they no nothing of burgers.  To be fair, this place only gave me food poisoning, it didn't kill my first born.  Also, the staff was top notch.  They should find a better restaurant to work at so I can order from them again.  As to the food, yes I've had the items people rave about on their menu.  I had the cheeseburger with bacon and the fried egg; the specialty.  My stomach and intestines found it special too.  Its not often I taste my food again while sitting on my porcelain throne; I was honored indeed.  I also had the bone marrow.  The bone marrow was good.  Its just roasted bone marrow, hard to mess up.  But the beef cheek marmalade that came with the marrow was terrible.  Its beef cheeks!  The best meat on the cow, seriously, it takes skill to screw up that cut.  I guess if pestered enough I could go back and try the rest of their menu, but thankfully my friends aren't sadists."
"An hour wait, but well worth it especially for the experience. My friend and I both got the burger w a fried egg on top (a must!) and we shared the duck heart hash. All were pretty decent. Got a few drinks plus the pickle shot- first time drinking it and loved it!"
Any place that plays Nas & the Fugees on reel-to-reel is cool in my book.
"If I had to give you one tip (and only one) it would be to arrive early. The kitchen opens at 5 but the bar and tables are available for searing beforehand. My friend and I got here at 430 and no tables were empty so we happily took our place at open kitchen/bar. We were greeted kindly by a server from whom we ordered cocktails while waiting for the kitchen to open. We chose ""Horses Mouth"" which is essentially a Moscow mule, made with Old Overholt Rye, rather than vodka. To be honest, I don't usually expect much in cocktails from restaurants that don't specialize in cocktails, but I enjoyed this drink enough to order a second.At 4:45 the server came around and took everybody's order so that the kitchen could promptly start preparing the food at 5. I thought this was a really great touch for such a busy restaurant. My friend and I weren't particularly starving so we shared a single cheeseburger and added a fried egg on top and also ordered a side of smashed potatoes with gravy. After much anticipation, the food finally arrived. I have to admit that it was only in front of us for about 7 minutes before our plates were pretty much empty. The burger was perfectly cooked and DELICIOUS. I was slightly disappointed that I had to share, but then remembered the side of smashed potatoes. Let me just tell you right now that I am a huge fan of mashed potatoes, with or without gravy, but these were fantastic. I feel like the concept of mashed potatoes WITH gravy is a lost art, but Au Chevail has managed to master it. It reminded me of the amazing potatoes and gravy that my parents used to make for me. All in all, this was an amazing experience and an amazing burger. Very friendly staff; good music volume; and lighting that doesn't require you to use the handy flashlight app on your phone."
I had been hearing about the burger here for a long time.  Never did I think that everything mentioned about this burger was true.  This is the second best burger I've ever had in my life and definitely the best by far in the city of Chicago.   There was a bit of a wait when I got there but it went much faster than estimated.  In the meantime I was able to walk down the street for some coffee from Little Goat.The servers were very friendly.  The only downside to this place is the overwhelming lack of vegetarian options.  All of the fried items are fried in lard to give them an amazing crisp texture and flavor.Overall I can't believe how cheap everything was relative to the quality of the food.  It is definitely one of the best values in Chicago.
"When you walk in it looks like a mix of dive bar, diner, and gastropub.  We showed up pretty late - around 11pm after most other restaurants in the city were closed.  The place is dark.  There's a very small spotlight on each table that you have to use to read the menu.  The rest of the table has zero light aside from some small candles.Even with that first impression, the food was very good.  We had the General Jane's chicken and bone marrow to start.  Both were very good.  Chicken was meaty and had a nice sweet garlic sauce with a bit of spice.  Even the garlic toast with the bone marrow was excellent.I went with the double cheeseburger with a fried egg and bacon.  The bacon is not really bacon, but more like smoked pork belly.  It's thick.  It's a meal in itself.  With the double patty, cheese, egg, and the pork, it was a substantial burger that I couldn't even finish.We had fries and the hashbrowns with it.  The fries were good.  The hashbrowns weren't anything special.  Too greasy in my opinion.Aside from the food, they have a large beer on tap selection.This is a great place to have a good greasy burger.  If you're into healthy food, the fresh fish (was salmon that night) was good, but I think you would be better served there if you are ready for your grease fix."
"We had a terrific Friday lunch for ""Hamburger Day"" here and enjoyed the experience.   This is a small place with Great Music playing the entire time.   We were told it would be a 30 min wait and we could stand to the left of the door and the waiter would take our drink order while we waited.  Our table was called in 15 min and they simply moved our drinks to our food order. I hate it when restaurants make you pay separate for drinks when you came in to eat     Service was great and so were the burgers!    Check it out for yourself!"
"One of the best meals I had in Chicago!  Started with a unique and rare beer,  had the bone marrow (so good!). And finished off lunch with the Burger with egg and bacon (a must).  If you're on vacation in Chicago, this is a GREAT place to go.  Great vibe, amazing food and top place for a nice meal at a fair price."
"The burger lives up to the hype!  It's worth the 2 hour wait for sure!  While you're waiting, pop in to Lone Wolf for a Boilermaker and you'll be texted that your table is ready before you know it."
"This place is simply amazing!!! Best burger and bloody in Chicago.  It's small so if you go (and I think you should!) I would encourage you to go at odd hours (before noon, late nights) or stalk the first come first bar seating, or be ready to wait 45-1hr+.  Btw, the cheeseburger a Cheval will be two meat patties if you grab brunch here, so if you want less meat, make sure you ask!Also, the marrow is pretty good but not as fantastic as everyone says - worth a shot though."
"A fantastic burger - doesn't live up to the hype of 'best burger I've ever had', but not once would I say 'not for me' if it was placed in front of me. The thick cut bacon & fried egg on the burger is definitely the veteran move."
No words can describe how delicious the chilaquiles are!!!  I don't eat red meat and was a little bummed that the claim to fame is the burger.  I didn't miss out when I ordered the chilaquiles!!We sat at the bar and had amazing service and watched them in action as they prepared each order.  The service as delightful and the food was incredible.  I will definitely be back for dinner!
It was literally a 2 hour wait... but that burger is DEFINITELY WORTH every minute of waiting. my suggestion is you go and sign up on th waiting list and then go play pool around the corner or drink coffee and chat or go do something cool and then prepare to have your socks blown off by the food when you come back
"Good burger.  I was very skeptical as it seems to be a very cool place to get a burger. Nevertheless, as many people claim, I actually am a burger expert. The burgers are good here. The single is actually 2 thin patties, which they have figured out how to cook medium/medium well.  There are obviously very skilled cooks or chefs in the back. You must be a fan of mayonnaise, as the coleslawish garnish has it for sure. The cheddar cheese is high quality. The fries are fresh cut and come with garlic aioli, heavy garlic - but great. I liked the meal. Share the fries. 1 for 2, or 2 for 3 or 4. Service was spot on.  It left me desiring no more or less attention. Thanks Au Cheval!"
"I'd been once many months ago for drinks. Last night, Sun 1/12/14, I stopped in on a hungry whim. Heard the burger is ""the best in Chicago."" Umm...it's good, but nowhere close to the best. Not far away on Milwaukee and Kinzie is the best burger I've ever had, Paramount Room's wagyu burger. That absolutely trounces Au Cheval's!Alas, Au Cheval has the benefit of hype on its side. It's part of a consortium of restaurants that are very good, or so I hear. Gilt Bar is among them and that place is top notch. I haven't been to Maude's or Bavette's or the rest of their spots.Au Cheval is dark. Dark from the outside, for the longest time I lived close by and always assumed it was closed. It's like one way glass tinting. From the inside you can see the street but not vice versa. It's very low lit inside, which I like. Geris probably won't but then this ain't the place for ya. It's easy to call this place hipster but that does it a disservice as it has more of an eclectic clientele (read, everyone in Chicago...back to that hype machine!).Now I feel bad doing a review based on one visit, one burger, but maybe I'll stop in again for something else and update this.The burger is two patties, NOT cooked to order, stacked high on a plain bun. Cheese might be American? House-made pickles are really good, not too sweet like store-bought crap. There's a dijon/mayo combo sauce which had a nice little horseradish-y taste. Bacon is Gilt-Bar-house-made and Au-Cheval-finished as a friendly cook explained to me. It's quite a process with multiple maple infusions and heating steps. It's ultra thick, about the same thickness as the burger patties, which are, to me, non-gourmet-burger-thin.Nice menu of mixed drinks, excellent, if pricey, beer selections. $3.50 house whiskey shot is a nice touch. And if you're slumming it, apparently they have $3 tallboys of crap beer available. PBR and Schlitz and the like. I found it funny that the cooks were drinking Tecate cans while working. Cool!"
"Had a great quick lunch today at Au Cheval. I was greeted immediately by Maggie, who directed me to the bar. As a server myself, you can tell she was on point - always keeping communication up with her fellow staff as to where she sat two-tops, three-tops, etc. Great introduction to my first time expectations of Au Cheval.My server, Ryan, was very prompt and personable. I am a craft brew guy and, seeing as Ryan had a full section of guest, he took the time to recommend an AMAZING bready pale ale from Evil Twin brewers. After talking beer with him, he also provided me with a taster of this great sour mash that I have never had. Great, personable service I received.I haven't even got to the food yet but do I need to paint a picture of the burger here? If you live in the city you've heard about this burger. It absolutely holds up to the hype. Worth traveling to experience.Overall it was a good dining experience - service was great from the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out. Something I take very seriously, hence why I am writing this review. Would absolutely recommend this place."
"Amazing, Amazing, Amazing!  The food here is bomb and so tasty, but i felt everything was slightly on the saltier side.  Keep in mind, NO RESERVATIONS, i would come promptly at opening, the average wait usually runs 1.5hrs, put your name down and wander the neighborhood or go grab drinks elsewhere.  Their brunch menu is limited and doesn't feature all the amazing delicious sounding dishes on their dinner menu.  I tried a side of bacon, it's legit sweet glazed thick cut pork belly cook to perfection!  So tasty and delicious, definitely a must order for sharing if you like pork.  The burger here is really tasty, get it with all the fixings, perfectly seasoned and cook.  They definitely know how to make a bomb burger!  Get the crispy fries for sharing, so good topped with their sauce and fried egg.  It also comes with a side of garlic aioli.  The fries are double fried, super crispy but not oily, packed with so much flavor :)Last i sampled the chilaquiles, it was okay but a little strange.  This dish was also a little salty and oily from the greasy chips.  The top it with too much sour cream, good guac, and this weird egg and cheese scramble which didn't have enough flavor or texture, it was like eating egg fluff.  I didn't care for the chilaquiles only because it was too salty, greasy chips, and kind of plain.Interior is small, open kitchen, almost hipster feel and music.  Place is always crowded but worth trying if you want hearty american food.  Get the bacon, the burger, and the fries, they are so tasty and packed with flavor!"
"A tight tight tight restaurant, lots of locals, hip in crowd, they do not take reservations, 6 big men put into a booth made for four prople I got the bitch seat in the middle, and thought this food better be good!  It was, we ordered the foie gras pate with a jam to start, a bone marrow and a fried chicken with an Asian flare and a little spicy to die four, next course go all six of us was the burger with the an egg, nice fresh pickles and a nice aioli, I was stuffed and so were my table mates but they forced the burger down, one of best if not best burger I ever had in my life!!"
"Everything about the place is great, except you usually wait for at least an hour... The single cheeseburger is my favorite with an egg on top... The chilaquiles are also great!! Espresso really good and lots of local beers..."
"All you need in life is the single burger (which still comes with two patties) with a fried egg and the super delicious thick cut bacon. After our first bites my friend and I looked up at each other in awe, I don't know how a burger could be on such an entirely different level than all other burgers I've previously eaten."
Awesome burger and hash browns!
"One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Usually a long wait but it's worth it every time. I got a bacon cheeseburger, man was it guuuuuuud."
"This is a great place if you have the time to grab a few drinks (the ones you were gonna order at and post dinner anyway) while in line. It's got a comfortable, romantic ambiance. Had to try their famous open faced bacon and cheese fondue / fried egg. Can't really go wrong with anything smothered in melted cheese and some thick pieces of bacon with a fried egg that fits perfectly aligned on top of the bun. This is the glutinous reason you ordered this, so mind as well indulge! *Note, the taste of this burger was heightened by the Old Fashioned, a few of them. Also shared the foie gras with a cherry tart jam. I'm always down for foie gras, and the cherry sauce was awesome."
"I've wanted to try this place for a long time, and decided, what the heck and  treated myself to lunch.  I strolled in and was informed it would be a twenty minute wait - turned out to be maybe five.  I ordered the double bacon burger and fries. I was served three patties, cooked perfectly, delicious pork belly and truffle fries.  I wasn't expecting it to be so heavenly.  Yes, worth the walk and the wait.  I will return."
"if you haven't tried this place yet, don't let the long wait deter you. yes, it absolutely is a super long wait to get a table/seat, but it's certainly an experience that every food enthusiast should try out at least once.so. lotta buzz about that au cheval burger. lotta buzz. i got the single cheeseburger with bacon and a fried egg on top, and while i didn't find it life-changing or earth-shattering, it was still a really, really, really delicious burger, and eating it was an immensely pleasurable experience. i'm a sucker for anything with a fried egg on it, so that was messy and delightful and delicious. the meat itself was nice and juicy. while the bacon was quite delightful, next time i will get it on the side -- i found that it overpowered the rest of the burger for me. we also got fries with our burgers, and if i hadn't gorged myself on the burger itself, i probably would have eaten more fries because they were nice and crisp, and the garlic aioli was dope. really what *made* the experience for me was the root beer -- GOOD GOD THAT ROOT BEER. SO. DELICIOUS. it was my favorite part of the meal, hands down.the wait staff seemed well-meaning, but quite scattered and frantic. we were left alone for quite a while until we started asking around for our server. he was apologetic and our orders did come out quite quick. it would have been nice to have more attentive service, but i guess it wasn't that bad when you consider how busy the place was. the space itself is very dark, it's loud, and it's a bit cramped. not normally something i'm into, but an ambience generally befitting of a place with this kinda buzz, i suppose.maybe the best part of my au cheval experience was standing outside, waiting for our table, people-watching, and listening to dejected people gripe about the wait. the indignation is super entertaining/priceless. anyway, i will be back at some point, if only for the root beer alone."
Omg the bacon here is off the chain!!!  Thick cut slices of greatness. I would come here and just order 5 orders as bacon as my meal. I came here with a group of five. Waited about an hour and a half. It was worth it for the bacon. The fries here are really crispy and crunchy. I really like the aioli sauce bc it has a spicy kick to it. I ordered the cheeseburger with bacon and a fried egg. It was enormous and I think next time I would ask for only one patty. I cant stress enough how awesome the bacon is......make sure you order a side of it!
"A burger and bone marrow. If they could somehow import some barbecue brisket from Texas, I daresay they have all the best B foods in the world covered. Au Cheval was probably number one on my Chicago bucket list, and I'm finally glad to have checked it off. It's small, doesn't take reservations, and feels generally daunting whenever you're out and about the West Loop during peak times. Naturally, we ambled in on a pre-lunch weekday, immediately following a hearty breakfast at Little Goat.The burger: fantastic, simple, tasty. We added a fried egg. A must. After seeing the thick-slab bacon, I daresay that should be a staple as well. There's nothing fancy about Au Cheval's burger; it's just good eating. Bon Appetit calls it a ""zero pretension"" burger, and I wholeheartedly agree. It looks like how a cheeseburger should look, and tastes like how a cheeseburger should taste.The bone marrow: Yum. I can't decide which offering was better, Au Cheval's or The Purple Pig's. I will say that Au Cheval's beef cheek marmalade was a nice cherry on top, packed full of flavor and a nice reference to a provencal daube stew that warms the belly on a cold night.The rest: the whole menu is made for eating, even the $9.95 chile con carne and corn chips. Uhh, out and about in Texas, we call that sucker a Frito Pie, and it costs a buck-fitty at a little league baseball game. I won't hold the profit maximization against you, Au Cheval. The place and decor immediately became one of my favorites in Chicago. The service was prompt and friendly. And the beer list was hearty and stout.Now I just need to find some off-peak time to amble in again. And hey, Au Cheval, if you want to FedEx some BBQ from Texas Hill Country, well, I'll eat that too."
"Let me say this upfront... THE BEST BACON I've ever tasted.  Period.  I single out the bacon because even though I don't eat it much, it's obviously the one ingredient that made an already-superb tasting beef patty even more glorious.  Not sure how they cook their beef, but wow, what an INCREDIBLY tasty sandwich.  Everything in it was well-seasoned.  And did I read that correctly... $11 for a double (ahem... the menus says ""single"") gourmet hamburger!?  Holy, holy cow... literally.    For being so popular, Au Cheval felt a bit limited in space (If I were them, I would consider expanding).  We were lucky to get a table in under 20 minutes while waiting at the bar (great drinks, well-mixed).  We shared an order of bread & butter pickles and fries.  Sure, tasty... but not the greatest sides.  And then the burger arrived... on that hearty bun... with that shiny egg... with those juicy pickles... and that thick, tender BACON... everything melted in my mouth... then melted some more... Ok, I'll stop now. ;-)  BY FAR one of the best burger experiences I've ever had.  Anywhere."
"Wham bam thank you mam! I have been back a couple times since my first brunch, and I have to say - as an experience burger eater, this is my favorite burger in Chicago, hands down.I would appreciate a bit more room, as it is a small space, but hey, when you're eating the food - it's like nothing else exists.The last time I went, my friend and I got the fries with the fried egg and 3 sauces.  I had never gotten this dish and I am happy I did this time.  I would highly recommend ordering it along with your burger if you are feeling overly glutenous and want to stuff yourself silly.If I can leave you with one small tip - the single is a double and the double is a triple.Now go on, and get some meat."
"Everything they say is true. The menu is small, the ambiance is dark and vibey, and the burgers are awesome! I haven't actually had a single dish I haven't loved. Even the simple things like pickles, blueberry muffins, and English breakfasts...Au Cheval somehow takes them from good to great. The bloody marys are packed to the brim with pickles and there is a unique fruity breakfast drink called ""the painkiller"" - not to be missed. I know it is pretty useless to try to eat ""healthy"" at this joint, but I typically do a bunless burger and they are happy to accommodate. It isn't served in a lettuce wrap, just straight up on a plate to be enjoyed with a knife and fork. The burger itself is so f-ing fantastic, you don't miss the bun."
This place is amazing. Not only was the food and atmosphere perfect but since it was our first time they brought us a desert sampler for free. The long wait is definitely worth it.
"PERFECTION - One word to describe what Au Cheval strives for. Au Cheval is a foodie's dream...The food is picture perfect and the tables even have spot lights for your food!! What else do you need? On top of that, the booths are made of nice leather that makes you feel classy and the music is right up my alley. i.e. Radiohead followed by LCD Soundsystem...mind blowing.I went back for the second time for the infamous burger and my oh my....freaken great. I got the fried egg and the bacon added on...of course! The bacon is mouthwatering and nice and thick w/hunks of black pepper and the burger's fixings create the perfect palate pleaser. Has to be one of my favorite burgers of all time. I also tried the Chilaquiles and the chips were crispy but not too oily. Fresh Jalepenos, red onions, cilantro, etc...Really good.Service could be a little better up front...but maybe she was having a bad day.Otherwise, Good job Au Cheval!!!!!!"
"Rated best burger in the country, it's amazing, make sure to put an egg on it, but I think the bacon is a little much. The bologna sandwich is great too. The pork porterhouse is amazing, they only have a couple every day and they are for two people, get there early if you want in on that."
"Great ambiance with low lighting and intimate settings, but the music can be a little loud.  We went there at 4:30 p.m. to beat the crowd. There were people already there getting their drinks on.  They don't serve food until 5 so we ordered a couple drinks. I had one of their strong drinks called the Vieux Bonal which was tasty but a bit sweet for my taste (I don't like sweets to begin with).  For the food we ordered the roasted bone marrow which was absolutely DIVINE.  The beef cheek marmalade was sweet and meaty and it pairs perfectly with the toast. We also got the single cheeseburger  with a fried egg.  The single comes with two patties, the double comes with three.   This was definitely one of the best burgers I've ever tasted.  I love that they use a pretzel bun instead of a regular bun.  It definitely gives it that extra fancy kick. We also had the crispy fries which were good but I was expecting more than just fries with an egg on top.  Next time i'll be ordering a different side."
"Did not disappoint. They are associated with Gilt Bar and Maude's Liquor Bar, so I'm not surprised. We had the Horse's Neck (whiskey based with a ginger beer, so refreshing and perfect for summer) and Flapper (a little too much on the ice but a happy and not too overpowering flavorful gin drink) cocktails to start, shared fries, and for dinner had the foie groie eggs and toast and a double cheeseburger with an egg and bacon. I ended with a Hemingway Daquiri, which was both sweet and tart - it was like Christmas in the summer. The main dishes were rich and heavy, but oh so yummy; service was delightful and the food was quick (we were there around 5pm). Easy and free street parking but probably worse during the evening hours, yet otherwise not that bad. No reservations taken just like most of the other places in the west loop so try to get there early before the crowd gets there. Think of it as a pricey diner, but well worth the food and ambience. Great for date night or a drink with a friend!"
"This is my favorite, if not, one of my top favorite burgers around.  With over 1000+ reviews, it's worth the visit even as a tourist!Seating is limited thus making it difficult to sit a large party.  Squeezing 6 of us to a booth on a hot day sounds unbearable, so we decided to just split up.  Service is great and ambiance is similar to a classy pub.They don't take reservations so arrive early when they open!  I got the single burger which is still huge and I had more than enough for leftovers."
"I've had good burgers, and I've had bad burgers. Hell, even the bad burgers are good burgers as far as I'm concerned. But I'm always on the quest for the best burgers and by jove I think I've found one.You know it's going to be good, when your mostly vegetarian friend recommends you get the burger. Because we all know, most vegetarians are jealous of meat eaters, specifically because of things like burgers. Burgers are a universal truth. To experience a perfect burger is to experience the meaning of life. A dead animal so perfectly elevated it will live forever in your mind's eye. (what?)For a tuesday evening, the wait was reasonable. Our conversation hovered around details. How one boutique hotel can be amazing, and another falls flat all because of the little things. The right chair, the proper arrangement of lamps... the little things make a huge difference in our experiences. Right?Au Cheval gets it... the wonderfully dark mood lighting with almost pitch black walls and ceiling. Your focus is pushed to what's in front of you. Your friends, and your food. It says a lot about a restaurant when EVERYTHING is good. Take the absolutely wonderful fries our server encouraged us to share. Perfectly salty and on their own... a great treat. No need to improve. But wait! The mayo provided was homemade and intensely garlicky. They could have served miracle whip and we would have been happy. But nope, they took the little details to another level.And ok, back to the burger. It arrived open faced so you can observe the perfectly cooked egg and it jiggled a little as it hit the table. Eggspertly (sorry) cooked to an exact sunny side up, it melted all over the burger as everything was put together. And the bacon! Holy moses the bacon was spectacular. More pork belly in cut than a typical thin slice, it was rendered to a state of soft porky heaven. The flavors and textures of the meat, cheese, egg & bun (plus pickles! yes! pickles!) mushed into each other so wonderfully there was no question I had to consume everything in front of me. Had there been a dozen more burgers on the table, I would have had to eat them as well.Side note, the typography on the menu is absurdly bad. SO bad, it couldn't have been intentional... that was the only detail that rubbed me the wrong way. But I'm an obnoxious graphic designer by trade so that's more on me than them.I can't wait to come back. Truly one of the best burgers in Chicago. It's a tiny spot, and looks to get pretty crowded but it's worth the wait. Service was typical friendly Chicago and I feel like I really got a lot of bang for my buck. Top notch!"
Best burger. Everything is really good.
"Sooooooo delicious!  Didn't give five stars cause it was about a 2 hour wait (Friday after work). But I would definitely go back and wait again,  very nice and comfy place.  During the wait,  headed next door at Lone Wolf for drinks. The single burger was really double patties, which was very tasty, fresh, and made right in front of us (open grill). Ordered the wings as an appetizer and they were sticky goodness, drenched in this sweet sauce that you can dip your fries in (thanks to the chef giving us the heads up). Fabulous service and very clean place."
"Foie and eggs. I could eat that every day. The foie is seared crispy with that melty explosion of fantastic fun fat flavor in your mouth. Ugh, so good! How do they do that?!Also had the fried chicken which was Korean chicken wing style. Very solid and delicious. Bone marrow-more melty goodness in my mouth. Their cocktails are good. Service was good. During the wait, the hostess came and took our drink order and transferred it to our check. We sat at the bar in front of the cooking area. It was fun to see the chefs at work.I will go back to try their burger and brunch."
"Phenomenal burgers. I wish the wait wasn't so long, but if you come at the right time, you can get a seat without waiting. Definitely get the bacon topping."
"So, before leaving the city we decided to give this place another shot.  After a 2.5 hour wait on a Monday night at 6/8:30, we finally sat down and ate a pretty un-impressive burger.  I really have no idea why people rave about this burger ( I LOVE burgers and this place would never fall into my top 10).  I'm sure there's some more amazing things on the menu.  Just don't come here to wait for hours on this burger.  Not worth it at all! Simple."
"""Ron Swanson's Viagra""When people said that it was the best burger in the city, I had to try it. I categorize ""best burger"" award into two categories: traditional and weird (i.e. toppings). Nothing weird about the toppings here, just your regular ground beef, egg, bacon, and usual vegetable accoutrements. Beef was fresh, seasoned perfectly, and the egg was cooked the way you want it. I don't remember the cheese but it was soft, rich, silky and complemented the burger without overpowering it. And their bacon... I WANT IT IN MY WEDDING CAKE. Thick cut, peppered, and sugary glazed perfection. When God had his last meal, this bacon was within arms reach on the table. If I were an NFL player, after scoring a touchdown, I would pull a bowl of it out of my pants and proceed to feed on it without silverware. If there was an amateur night at a strip club and the grand prize was this exact bacon... I would rob the place while others were competing. Best traditional burger in the city of Chicago. Sorry Kuma's, you WERE the best like a decade ago. Time's are a changing.Tip: For dessert, order the fried bologna sandwich. If you don't, everyone around you will stare at you unfavorably.Tip #2: Go early! Otherwise you're going to have to wait."
"Came as a tourist, left as a devout fan. There's likely a very long wait, so put your name down and walk around the area. Once inside, holy smokes: crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy and their cheeseburger are absolutely incredible. One of the best burgers I've ever had! We sat at the bar and the pace at which they make eggs, burgers, and everything else is incredible. My wife and I enjoyed watching them cook up a storm.Highly recommend if you are looking for a meal while in Chicago."
"Great location next to several other amazing food venues. I would suggest making reservations as the restaurant packs people in like sardines. Also, the poor host is running on overdrive trying to process all the walk-in diners.I came for a late night dinner run with friends. Suffice to say, we waited an hour without reservations. However, given their text-to-table, set up, we could wander through the Randolph Street area without worrying that we missed our names.My friends settled on the burger fair (complete with a sunny side up egg, mind you) while I opted for the slightly heavier potato hash with an egg and duck fat gravy. Yep, duck fat. GRAVY. Seriously fantastic, but also seriously for those with a hankering for the rich and full fat. In the end, I think I won out since my two compadres thought the burger meat came out a bit oversalted. The lighting is a bit wanting and wonky. Our booth had one central light we had to fight over to see our menus. However, it acted as a beautiful spotlight for some quality food photography. Given the crowded hour-long wait and the heavy-handed seasoning on the burgers, Au Cheval impressed but still needs to live up to the seemingly well-deserved hype."
t-h-e  b-e-s-t.
"This is my fourth review in a row for a Chicagoan restaurant that is a 4/5 star. I'm so impressed with how the food scene here has grown and grown. We came in on a Monday night and it was PACKED. I loved the vibe. Small place! Dark, but not too dark, with great music on the speakers. It was bustling and loud enough to get that great conversation buzz/murmur feel, but not too loud that I had to yell at my dining partner for her to hear me. We were told a 2 hour (!) wait, but stalked the bar like crazy people and were able to sit down within one cocktail (yes, that's how I measure time). We both got burgers with bacon and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they cooked them at medium automatically. We also had the chopped salad as a app and the fries with mornay sauce as a side. More and more drinks were consumed. Food came, scarfed down with reckless abandon. Last pleasant surprise? The bill! It came out to about $60 for the both of us. Will be back again - hopefully the wait isn't too crazy the next time I come!"
Absolutely unreal burger.  Wait was 3.5 hours on a Friday night but solid bar next door was a perfect place to hang.  Get a double and extra thick bacon added on top.You'll be full for about 2 days after!
"5 stars for the burger. One of the best burgers, if not THE best burger I've ever had. Order it Au Cheval style and thank me later. 5 stars for the chilaquiles, only served after midnight. 3.5- 4 stars for the waiting staff service once you are seated. Typically fairly fast and friendly.Nice beer selection, very cool atmosphere and ambience. 1 star for the host/ hostess service on multiple occasions, and the reason my review is 3 stars instead of 4.5- 5. They will have a long wait out the door no matter how they treat their guests, and they seem to treat their guests when they walk in as if their business does not matter because of this. Not sure if the host staff is trained to act this way, or if we had bad luck or happened to get a couple jerks on a power trip since they've reached the peak of their career as a host at this Chicago establishment. The host staff in my experience has been rude, unreasonably inflexible, unhelpful and provided bad information. I'll spare the details, but wouldn't be writing about it if I had not had a negative experience on more than one occasion for different reasons. They need to get over themselves or someday the food won't be enough to come back and deal with the host staff of an otherwise 5 star restaurant. I don't think I've ever complained about the host staff in any other review, but the staff I've encountered at Au Cheval warrants it.If you read some of the negative to average reviews on Au Cheval, they are all about similar service/ attitude at the restaurant and not the food. I highly suggest that the management should take these seriously and do something to address it."
"I've been here for dinner and brunch and Au Cheval never disappoints! You can't go wrong with the foie gras and scrambled eggs to start off your day. The foie is very creamy and cooked perfectly and strangely enough it tastes amazing with eggs. If you are still craving more, then get an order of the crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy. Deliciousness! Cocktails are very much on point. Bloody Mary's is made with Tito's vodka and goes down very smooth :)! For dinner, try the honey fried chicken with chili! It has the right amount of spiciness and sweetness. Enjoy!"
"The 90 min wait was well worth it! Very friendly staff, an even friendlier bartender and food that blew my mind! The smoked bacon and the Bloody Mary deserve ten stars each!"
"The only bad thing is that the burger here is so good that you may have to wait for a table... But the burger!  oh em yum!Such a great spot! If you are visiting or have friends in town, this spot is surely to impress!!"
"5 stars for service, for pickles and for burgers.  The server was wonderful.  The hostess and the runners never once had a smile even though we sat at the small round table that they had to walk by to serve every other patron, so there was a lot of eye contact and no smiles... The side of pickles was ginormous and delicious.  And my husband ordered the double cheeseburger, which was almost too big for him to finish.  It was wonderful!  I had the open faced ham and cheese sandwich which was not really my thing.  Now we know.  The matzoh ball soup was delish and the matzoh was huge and presented amazingly."
"So I ordered a burger from this spot asked for Bleu cheese on the side. They told me they won't give me Bleu cheese because it doesn't taste good with their burgers. I don't understand that if that's what the customer wants then give it to them, how hard is that?  Very disappointed in this restaurants service."
"We got to Au Cheval at 4:30 and put in our names for 8 people and waited 2.5 hours. When we got to the door, it was a 4 hour wait for a party of 4, insane! But we hung out at another bar while we waited, and they called us when they were ready - so not a bad way to wait at all. We got the fried chicken to share - hot but delicious - and then I tried the single burger with fries. The single burger is actually 2 patties, and I got it with bacon. It was really good! The sauce on it was fresh and complimented the bacon well. I did find the burger and fries a bit over salted for me, which is why I can't give them 5 stars, but overall the meal was delicious. I got the Daiquiri and the flavor was unique and yummy. Food Network gave this place a rating of the best burger in the country - but I would argue otherwise. However, I did enjoy my meal and would come again. One FYI - its all small tables, so if you come with a party bigger than 4 people, you will be split up."
"I have a rule about writing Yelp reviews: only review this visit. I've been Au Cheval before and I had a much better time and I enjoyed my food much more (definitely a four-star experience), but I honestly didn't really like what I had last night, hence the three stars. I ordered the crispy potato hash with a fried egg and duck heart gravy, and the hash itself was perfect - super crunchy, oily but not in an overwhelming way. The gravy, however, was literally among the saltiest things that I've ever eaten. I realize that duck (and duck heart specifically) are pretty salty, but I actually ended up eating all of the hash with about a third of the gravy, and I still thought it was too salty. (For reference, I've also had the cheeseburger, bacon and fish, and they were all better than this.... but I did not eat them on this trip.) The service was okay. I think (as I always think when I see others around me getting better service) that I would have gotten better service had I ordered a drink, but as it was it was a bit of a struggle to get someone to pay attention to me."
"2 hour wait for 5 at 7PM on a Tuesday seemed excessive but the food was that good that it was 100% worth it. Best burger I have ever had bar none definitely get it with an egg and the dijonnaise they put on it is fantastic - honestly it is the perfect griddle burger.Other food was also fantastic, the chicken liver, General Jane's chicken wings, bratwurst and fries (garlic aioli was incredible). They do a great pickleback shot here as well.I'd come back every week for the burger it is honestly that good, just wish they took reservations"
"Great music, hip decoration, fantastic food! I also like the mixed drinks here but in general, when I get to Au Cheval, I cannot make it past beyond that amazing burger, fries with the fried egg, and an ice cold beer!"
"Came to Au Cheval during my time in Chicago for the best burger in town! We waited a long time in very cramped quarters since it was raining outside, got some attitude from the front end while waiting, and I got beer on tap spilled on me by a bartender (the spill unfortunately downgraded my rating since it took her about 10 minutes to actually realize she spilled all over, and didn't really apologize but blamed it on the tap) But, the terrible wait was worth the burger, which was juicy and served on a delicious bun. A SINGLE cheeseburger comes with TWO patties so be aware before you order! It was a bit pricy but filling and worth the price. Great pairing to one of their many beer choices. You have the option of adding an egg or bacon to your burger as well.Fries with the Garlic Aioli and Mornay Sauce was delicious! The egg was a little much along with the sauce and didn't really mesh well but the sauces were great. Overall, so-so service but juicy burger and worth a try if you are willing to wait."
"Au Cheval has been on my list of restaurants I've wanted to try for ages. Finally got a chance to go for brunch. Knew it would be busy so arrived right away at 10am when it opened on a Sunday. Must've been a line, because when we were seated (right at 10 on the dot) 3/4 of the restaurant was already full. I didn't realize how small it was inside, which explains the long wait times a bit more. Of course, tried the cheeseburger w/ an egg on it--was quite tasty (though not sure I would wait multiple hours for it). Also had the french press coffee (enough for a few cups for sure), the hashbrowns (so crispy on the outside--yum), and the traditional breakfast. The eggs were really great (a wetter scrambled egg), and the bacon was delicious. Also, loved that they were okay with having Heinz ketchup on the table. At the the same time, was a little surprised they don't do their own in-house ketchup. At any rate, would try this spot again during a time I could get there right when it opened or when I was willing to wait around for a couple of hours while grabbing a drink or two at the nearby establishments."
Burger here is truly amazing! Totally worth the long wait.  I usually don't buy into the hypes but once I tried the food here I was sold.  Burgers were juicy and flavorful without all the distracting ingredients to mask the flavor of meat.  French fries were fresh and crispy and their homemade bread and butter pickles were top notch.  Definitely  going back for more.
"I've been here twice, and had no issues with being seated immediately. Once Friday around 2pm and the other on Sunday around 5pm. I ordered a burger, or rather the server strongly encouraged a burger as I was an au cheval virgin. The burger was awesome and definitely worth coming back for. On my second trip I was a bit more enthusiastic about venturing out, and on the recommendation of another server, got the fried chicken. As much as people rave about it on yelp, I will no doubt be ordering the burger next time. The staff are all awesome, it's a bit tiny on the inside but still intimate enough to where you're not on top of another party or overhearing other peoples conversations. Definitely plan to come back with each one of my friends that hasn't been here yet, just to get my fill."
"Not to sound like another cliché review of Au Cheval, but this burger experience needs to be on eveyone's bucket list!  From the moment I first sank my teeth into the single (actually a double) attoped with thick maple bacon strips, my refined carnavoric taste buds fell in love. The fries were the absolute perfect compliment.  As an app, the messy seasame fried chicken was surprisingly tasty as well, albiet a bit pricy at $17. As reservations are not an option, it may not be a bad idea to camp out the night before as to ensure you get a table once the doors open."
"Foie gras scrambled eggsHash with duck heart gravyFries with mornay sauce (mehh), garlic aioli (mmmmm), and fried farm eggCheeseburger a cheval (we added bacon, you can also add an egg, or BOTH!)The above is one of many recipes for deliciousness, near-heart attack, and food coma at Au Cheval.Table for 3, please! 45 minute wait for Sunday brunch. Luckily, they take down your digits and text you when your table is ready. We ended up going to the juice bar down the street for a large cup of freshly squeezed OJ to hydrate and detox from the night before.The wait ended up being only 30 minutes, hooray!Brunch was phenomenal and I felt absolutely disgustingly stuffed. In my opinion, you should share these plates so you can try a bit of everything, but also because the portions here are sooooooo big! You'll probably get tired of whatever you order if you don't share. If we could do it again, we'd knock off one of the four items we ordered (can't decide which one). We definitely could have used the help of 1-2 more people.I've heard the burger is life changing from my friend's coworker. It was pretty good, but do I feel like my life has changed? Not really, aside from feeling chubbier.After brunch, we walked about to my friend's apartment and all of us PASSED OUT on the floor and couch. I kid you not.I'm interested in trying the dinner here. Too bad I don't live in Chicago. Oh well, I'll just have to visit again!"
"The Cheval burger is a Big Mac made with quality ingredients.  The dominant taste is the special sauce, American cheese and pickle.  Chicken wings were good but I would order the super salty Asian sauce on the side.  Sitting at the bar was an education in why the kitchen is usually in the back of a restaurant.  Copious amounts of salt where tossed by the handful onto everything coming out of the kitchen.  Cooks preparing food wore no gloves and handled everything including garbage and tasted fries while preparing orders.  Service was friendly and brisk.  Room is loud and bass is way too high for the actual volume of the music.  We felt like we got hit by a truck after eating lunch here, which seems to be the basic concept, but this is a one and done for us."
"I'll keep it short and sweet:  try the roasted marrow bones with beef cheek marmalade on thick cut toast points. Sweet and salty compliment each other so well.  It's umami heaven in your mouth.   If you've still got room, get a single cheeseburger with thick cut peppered bacon and an egg sunny side up. This might be the best burger you'll ever have in your life."
"First time here and we lucked out that there wasn't a huge line when we got there at about 515pm on a Friday night.  I thank the snow.  We waited less than 20 minutes for a table for 2.  I got the cheeseburger with egg and bacon.  I was nervous to get both because other reviewers mentioned it being too much food, but I thought it was amazing and I ate every last bite.  Maybe I'm just a fatty.  The fries were fine - nothing special.  My friend got the fondue which looked delicious - and she finished it all, so I gather that was a correct assumption.  I really enjoyed the Hemingway Daiquiri, which surprised me because I don't care for grapefruit.  Overall, just delicious!"
"thanks all for warning me about the wait.  we got there at 4:50, put our name down, walked to Grahams for cocktails.  by the time we finished our second cocktail, we were texted.  so about one hour and 20 min.  we walk over and had to wait another 20 minutes for them to clear and set the table.  ordered, honey fried chicken, OMG this was so good.  a brat, the potatoes under it was too decadent to put into words, so good.  we all ordered a version of the burger, some got singles, some doubles, but everyone had the quarter inch bacon, and the egg as well.  this combo somehow melts in your mouth with an explosion of flavor.  its messy, but so worth it.  off my bucket list now....  wish i knew the meats in the burger and the process.  how can they get it that delish? whats the fat/meat ratio? curious."
"Au Cheval is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!  I wish I could live above the restaurant and eat here everyday :) The only downside is there will at least be an hour and a half wait, but the wait is so worth it!  Everyone must have the burger and mornay fries at least once in there life or they have not lived.  I once waiting 3 hours because I had to have it!  I recommend putting your name on the list and then going over across the street to Haymarket Brewery and have a few beers while waiting.  Au Cheval will text you when your table is ready."
"Had some great drinks, cocktails and beers are unique, robust, and flavorful. Had the horse neck cocktail - lemon, ginger beer, and rye (if I remember correctly) I would suggest it! Enjoyed the ambiance and comfy seating too. Only down side was the server, had a horrible attitude and came off very aggressive."
"Hubby and I just had our anniversary lunch here and we loved it!  We both got the single burger with the egg and amazingly huge bacon and it's by far the best burger we've had.  We gave it for stars because the fries we good but not the best.  Hubby says they weren't the freshest but still very good.  Drinks were very good, I had the shake beer (delicious). Hubby got the flapper and he really enjoyed it as well. Overall great experience.  Service was fantastic!  We'll definitely be back :-)"
"For folks like me that are addicted to travel and food shows, Au Cheval is a good choice to get your butt of the couch and into a seat at the bar.Like everyone has said, it's not a big place, it's a respectable size, but with a large influx of people. Coming in on a Wed night, grabbing a solo seat at the bar was quick. On average, there are 4 people working inside the counter. It's amazing to see the orchestrated moves of the team. I watched chives artfully sprinkled on the fried egg, salt tossed high into a basket of fries. I almost passed out seeing the chef shave apples so quickly on the mandolin! The theater of culinary arts, exciting, isn't it?!? Having the best seat in the house (right in the middle where all the plates are swiped clean and bussed out), I can listen and watch the chaos of manning a lively gastropub. Pure entertainment. Loved it!Of course, if you are like most people, 99.9% are interested in the food. Is the best burger here? For me it was incredibly salty. It's tasty for a few bites, but because a single means two thin patties, you get twice the amount of salt than the average burger. There's something about the fat here that is absolutely delicious. Fries are amazing and with the aioli, it's heaven. I noticed above their fridge were individual containers of fries that were prepped. Something about doing that makes the texture of the potato very hardy and crispy. I would recommend splitting these. I was very full and uncomfortable afterwards, but damn, it's so good."
Hostess: What do you want?Me: I'm meeting some people.Hostess: you can look around.Server had a similar positive attitude.
"We stopped by on a Friday night and we were told the wait would be an hour to an hour and a half. The good thing about their long wait is that they text you when your table is ready so we went to Mariano's to kill some time. When we received the text, we have been waiting for an hour and 15 minutes. We all ordered the cheeseburger with a fried egg on top and shared the crispy fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli and a fried farm egg. The fries were really good and the aioli sauce was our favorite. The egg was a unique finish to the fries. For $9, we expected much more. The burger was just okay. The patty is so thin that it was disappointing. A single burger comes with 2 tiny patties and a double comes with 3. For an hour and 15 minute wait, we expected an amazing burger."
"The best burger in the city, worth the 45 minute wait on a Tuesday for sure. While you wait you can leave and go to a bar in the west loop for a drink and the host/hostess will text you when your table is ready. Once you get in and order it's not a long wait at all for the food."
"First, the wait: quoted 45 minutes or so, actual wait was around 15 minutes. Entire party must be present to be seated, but the hosts remain in contact via text. Very smooth process. Drinks: didn't try one of the menu cocktails, but sufficiently impressed by the beer offerings. Brews were well-curated & separated by style; two saisons ordered were different enough to justify their inclusion in the list.Food: tried the General Jane's chicken and the widely celebrated burger. The former was spot-on - six full pieces of fried chicken tossed in a sweet & spicy sauce. Full of flavor and not *too* much heat, sprinkles of fresh cilantro really helped make this dish.  The burger lived up to lofty expectations - two patties (or three in the ""double"") are flat-top griddled to a perfectly moist medium/medium-rare and nestled into an impossibly light brioche bun.  This is, indeed, the Krispy Kreme of burgers.  Standard toppings include well-melted American cheese, house-made pickles, and a Dijon sauce (mixed with mayo?); do yourself a favor and add a thick (very thick) slice of peppered bacon.Service: Quick and friendly - we were treated well and recognized after we visited twice in two days. Our server (same both times) was knowledgeable when it came to both the food menu and the beer list.Overall: An elevated diner done well and a standout in a decidedly trendy neighborhood. Would probably make a trip over to Au Cheval whenever I'm in Chicago."
"The most important thing that I can add to the conversation is this: get here as early as possible, with as few people as possible and be prepared to wait. This place is tiny, doesn't take reservations and is hella popular. Oh and we overheard someone asking for carryout as a solution, but they don't do that either.We made it to Au Cheval right in the nick of time around 5:30 on a Friday. We were told that it would be a 30-45 minute wait, but by the time we were finally seated at the bar, it had been about an hour. While we were being seated, a group of 4 people were told the wait was approximately two hours. They said that they'd traveled from out of state just to try it but didn't have time to wait 2 hours. I felt bad for them and cried a mental tear, but I didn't feel bad enough to give up our seats at the bar.The bar. Yes, let's discuss that part. I'm from the suburbs where I'm used to having plenty of elbow room. I guess I have to get used to this 'no room to breathe' thing if I'm going to hang in the city at popular places, but dang, I would like to enjoy myself at a nice table where I can sprawl out and have some leg room. The bar was pretty nice though since we got to watch the bartender work his magic and the chefs prepare the food.We were just hanging out minding our business when the darkest beer you've ever seen made it's way onto my all-white shirt. I can laugh about it now, but in the moment it was pretty damn tragic. Mainly because, a) I don't wear white very often because I'm a very messy eater, BUT b) It wasn't my fault this time and c) I didn't bring another shirt to change into. Yes, I was destined to hang out all night in a white shirt stained with dark beer. The manager was super nice though and came over right away to apologize and offer to have my shirt cleaned at a dry cleaner. (No need, it came out in the wash.) She handled the situation perfectly and me being one to not let things get the best of me, moved on and waited for my burger.Let me preface this by saying, I had the greatest burger in America a few months ago and every burger that I taste is probably never going to live up to that portrait of perfection (Holeman & Finch in Atlanta, look it up) The burger at AC was good. but it was just 'good' for me. I didn't have any orgasms or out of body experiences, but I liked it. The egg was perfectly cooked and oooozed all over my plate. The burger was so meaty and delicious. I would warn to skip the bacon because it's almost $4 and my husband said it tasted better without it. The burger doesn't come with fries and the fries are $5.95--but they are big enough for 2-3 people to split. These were some of the greeeeatest fries I've tasted in my life and the garlic aioli that came with it was to die for. I think I would come back solely for these fries & because there were tons of other things that I wanted to try on the menu.I'd recommend everyone to come try it because as we all know, no one will ever agree on the greatest burger ever, so just because I didn't have the big O over it, doesn't mean that you won't."
"My friends have hyped up this place for months and I was extremely excited. I read a ton of awesome reviews and even knew about the wait so I didn't mind that at all. When I got there I decided to order a single cheeseburger - no surprise. They asked if I had any dietary restrictions and I requested no bacon because of religious dietary restrictions. While they were able to accommodate no bacon, they told me they made their burgers and fries in pork fat and were not willing to accommodate for that. The only thing not made in pork fat was a salad and a foie gras dish, which I did not enjoy at all. Even the fries are made in pork fat. I'm really disappointed that I underwent a 3 hour wait and was not able to experience what most people experience at Au Cheval. The waiter was very cold and I feel like, given how common pork restrictions are, should have at least tried to see what accommodations could be made. For anyone who has dietary restrictions like that, don't come here because the staff will not be willing to consider your situation."
"This place seriously has the best burger I've ever had!!!! It was worth every minute of our 2.5 hour wait time (which seems crazy!) but it truly is worth it. Go across the street to HayMarket for drinks while you wait:) The restaurant is small and has a diner feel, the chefs are awesome and will answer any questions you have a it the menu. We got burgers with a side of egg fries (amazing). And go all out with the burgers and get the fried egg and bacon, you will not regret it!"
The burger is delicious. The fries are beyond delicious. The beer selection is hearty and incredible. The pickle shot is a nice palate cleanser. But...it's incredibly cramped and loud.
My trip to Chicago was complete after going to Au Cheval! My friends and I were craving a great burger so we decided to come here. We were so worried that we wouldn't be able to get seats since we arrived at 2:00 PM and the kitchen closes from 3-5 (duh who doesn't know that!) We were seated in about 45 minutes (got coffee at little goat). The place is small especially for such a busy restaurant but the staff was extremely nice and the food was amazing. THAT BURGER&BACON  I dream about that perfect burger and the fries with aioli sauce. It's pretty big burger tho so be prepared to feast! Taking a star off just because of how ridiculous the wait is. But it's totally worth it and I'll go back even in the polar vortex weather.
"Great place to go if you have a hangover or a long layover, as I did. Had the General Jane fried chicken, hash browns and cheeseburger (shared between friends). The hash browns and chicken were delicious. The burger was cooked to medium perfection, but the cheese had a Kraft singles taste that I was not fond of. Would totes go again."
"Best burger I've ever had. I was skeptical of this place and its notorious long wait times, but damn was it amazing. I went here on a Sunday night at 830. As I walked in some guy was walking out saying ""screw this place, I'd rather burn it down than wait that long""....... I prepared myself for a 3 hour wait time. To my surprise I walked in, and was seated at the counter right away. All I can say is it pays to eat alone sometime!! I ended up going with the single cheese burger with bacon and foie gras on it. Damn was it delicious. Literally the best burger I've ever had. didn't need ketchup or anything! I also grew up on fried bologna and cheeses, so I couldn't pass that up. The house made bologna was absolutely delicious. I left so full, but this was an absolutely phenomenal meal. I will definitely be back when in Chicago."
Hands down best burger. This is my favorite spot to bring friends and out of town guests.
"- First impression is, it's really dark - Second impression, it's really great- We got the vanilla custard and flay bread dessert, it's french and I forgot the name..it was tremendous. It is a must have, to close the meal- They have root berr. I haven't had a root beer in 15 years- If I wasn't so full off dessert...I definitely would have gotten the root beer float. How could one not?"
"Au Cheval is a great place. I went here for lunch. I got a burger and it was really great. Service was great, love the location, and food was on point. Prices were decent for what we got. My only is complaint is that I don't feel we got a lot of food for our money. For example, a burger comes just a burger, nothing else. It's almost like small plates. If you are going here id just make sure to ask and order based on how hungry you are."
"Yummy. I love so many things here, but most of all the Chilaquiles for brunch or late night snack. Love the dark and cozy vibe as well. Other notable menu items are the Rootbeer Float, General Jane's Honey Fried Chicken, and Crispy fries with eggs. Cocktails are quite good as well!"
"When you're in the mood for a solid cheeseburger this is the place to go but be prepared to wait. The kitchen closes between 3-5pm so I arrived a little before 5 and the wait was already an hour on a Sunday. But if you have time to wait, it's well worth it. Be sure to order a cheeseburger and add an egg and bacon. You won't be disappointed."
"Tiny.Lively.Burger was above average, but didn't live up to the ""best in Chicago"" hype I'd heard and was expecting."
"My brother is a Chef. He heard (from other Chef's) that this place had the best burgers in the country. I don't know if I'd go that far, but the burger was fantastic, tons of beer options, and well priced. The issue is that I was a single and got a quick spot at the bar but on a Friday night at 6ish when I left, I heard it was a 4 hour wait. I really enjoyed my meal but I'd never wait 4 hours. Believe you can make a reservation."
"I was told to go here for the best burger ever and wow did it deliver! We easily found Au Cheval and were told it would be a two hour wait. We did a few other things around the neighborhood killing time waiting for them to text us. They seemed to have the system down very well. We got in two seats at the bar right in front of the grills which was a little warm and very bustling. We didn't mind and it was interesting to watch the cooking. We ordered the double burger (actually a triple) with bacon but left out the sunny side up egg and got an order of the French fries. Very quickly our food was delivered. I have had a lot of burgers in my life but this one was incredible! Stupendous... spectacular... mind blowing! The fries are fried in pork fat so you can only imagine the taste. They are served with a garlic dipping sauce. Anyone who would ever think of putting ketchup on the food here should have their head examined. The prices are moderate and the wait is long but the food is so worth it. They have a large selection of beers on tap and the service was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The entire place was clean and nice. I cannot recommend Au Cheval highly enough."
"I love Au Cheval. I've been going here for the past 3 years, bringing everyone who visits Chicago to this place for an amazing burger and dining experience. My last few visits though have been utterly disappointing. Au Cheval is hip, trendy, unapologetically bold, and delicious. With that though, it has never been sloppy or forgotten what has made it so popular - the people. Until now that is. I wasn't going to say anything but this is an increasing trend, the staff is getting less attentive, less welcoming, and making the place less of a destination experience. Still a great burger, no longer great service."
"Perfection in a burger , fries and mashed potatoes. Worth the wait and hard to park locale."
"Judging on food alone, this place is fantastic: great tasting food at good prices. Some specifics: the burger is a must if it's your first time (2nd only to Owen and Engine), fried chicken is #2, I'd probably skip the bone marrowWhy 3 stars? The wait time (no reservations, no calling ahead) is always so ridiculous it's as if the restaurant is deliberately making you come and waste two hours standing outside because just because they can - I find myself often wanting to come back but don't want to have to plan a whole evening around it, food shouldn't have to be this hard."
"After hearing raving reviews from a true Chicago foodie, I was brought here for dinner and left feeling very full but also very fat. I'm surprised I didn't have a minor heart attack after everything I ate but it would have been worth it since everything was SO good.Au Cheval is known for their burger. Their single cheeseburger has double patties already just FYI. I added a fried egg. It was delicious but I had to cut it in half and eat it slowly since it was huge and quite heavy but it was delicious. Recommended.We shared the crispy fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli with a fried egg on top and it was an amazing combo. Recommended.My favorite was the roasted bone marrow. But not even the bone marrow... The side of beef cheek marmalade and thick toast was to die for!! SOOOO GOOD. I've never had such tasty marmalade before, I could eat that with toast for DAYS. The waiter kept trying to take the plate away when I wasn't done with the marmalade yet and I kept getting upset lol. Highly recommended.By some miracle, we still had room for dessert so we got the Black Dog ice cream trio and even the plain vanilla and chocolate flavors were so good but the peppermint stole the show. It tasted like a candy cane!Service was friendly and quick and we didn't have to wait too long to get a seat without a reservation. I can't wait to come back, there's a couple other things I want to try! Would definitely add this to your list of Chicago eats. Thanks so much LC!!"
"After returning to try their staple, the burger, I stand by my 3 star review. The burger was solid, but didn't blow me away.  I also tried the fried chicken which isn't fried chicken in the way more of us are used to.  It was very flavorful but also overdressed.  There was a huge puddle of sauce in the bottom of the dish.  I would classify as more of like a buffalo wing type of preparation as the crispy skin is covered in the awesome tasting sauce.  Service was sort of below par, as I do recall it was last time as well.  However the chefs do not disappoint as they are very friendly as well as putting on a little show for the patrons.  I enjoy it most for this but I prefer the food at Maudes or Bavettes."
"The wait often is brutal but there's just something about that delicious cheeseburger! I would encourage to go early, no matter if you're in the mood for a burger at 10 am or not. By the time you get in and get your burger you'll be ready to eat. Also, The root beer is delicious and thus the root beer float is magical!"
"High expectations for this place.  The burger pictures from other reviews looked so good.  I was in the mood for a great burger and beer.5:20pm on a Friday evening, I was told the wait was 35 - 45 minutes for two of us.  No problem, I'll have a great beer while I wait.  Strangely, they seat the bar and the only place to wait is the little nook at the end of the bar, the waiting pen.  I'm not sure how I feel about that.  I mean, it does make more space available for diners but it was a little off-putting at first.  Luckily a server was by to get a drink order and she tied it to my name on the waiting list so there was no messing with transferring the check or closing out.  Nice.The beer selection was great.  They have a great layout on the beer menu, splitting the beers by style.  I went for the Harviestoun Old Engine Oil and later, the Allagash Black.  Both great and lots more ""Rich"" beers to try in the future.Our wait was less than 15 minutes in fact.  Awesome.We sat and our enterprising server, Maggie, immediately steered us towards the 32oz pork porterhouse.  She said they usually only have one for the night but tonight, they had two.  Hmmm.  Fine.  Let's do it.We split the porterhouse and ended up ordering two sides of Smashed Potatoes... one was nowhere near enough.Yeah, it was pretty tasty.  It wasn't perfect but it was damn good.  The thing comes standing on its end and you butcher/carve your way through it.  The tenderloin side was medium rare and very tender and flavorful.  The strip side was medium to medium-well and was still tasty but maybe slightly overdone.  There was a pleasant rosemary seasoning and the apples and sauce on the side was a perfect complement.  The dish included a smattering of foie gras chunks.  By the description, I expected something else.  The foie gras was just kind of scattered in with the apple pieces.  I expected a more prominent role for it.  But hey, it's foie gras.  It was still plenty tasty and I was motivated to pick out the pieces.  I hope I didn't miss any.Service was good, the staff was cordial and we drank many beers after we ate.  If I had to do it over again, I would go somewhere else for beer after the food.  At $10/pop, the bill ended up being much larger than I was expecting.  Still, a great experience overall and I hope I have the chance to make it back before long to try the burger."
"This place deserves all the hype. All of it. At one point I came here every week! The food is worth the price. You're getting some quality and tasty stuff in this place. The bacon oh my, order it with everything. It's like candy! And the chicken dinner , my my my. Might be some of the best chicken I've had in quite some time. I really do just want to try everything on the menu. I will !"
"I've been meaning to come here for awhile as they're supposed to have the best burger in town. A few of my friends have described it as ""life changing"" and me as a burger fanatic and snob had to eventually try it. The times I've tried to come here had a two hour wait, and since I don't like to wait that long for most food, I opted out.This time around, my friends and I got there before 5pm and had no wait. The inside is nice and kind of standard for a Sodikoff restaurant. Of course I had to order the cheeseburger, which is actually 2 4-oz patties along with the cheese and a great bun. Most of my friends ordered the exact same thing, though one of my friends got the fries. I have to say, the fries with the dipping sauce are the best I've ever had anywhere in the world. They're amazing and I don't even like most peoples' fries (and I try to eat pretty healthy) but i'd eat these all day if I could.The burger itself was juicy, the bun was great, the cheese great and the egg I got on top was full of runny goodness. The only problem I had with the burger was the uniformity of flavor. Some bites were really, really good. Like one of the best burgers i've ever had good (though not the best still). Other bites were average and a normal slightly above cheeseburger good. My friends also got the bacon on their burgers, which is not your standard supermarket bacon. This is thick slab that probably came from some farm nearby and full of flavor.After I was done polishing off the burger, I somehow managed to fit in a bowl of Matzo Ball soup. If you're used to the kinds where you get three medium sized balls, then you're going to be out of your element. This is a big bowl with one giant matzo ball in the middle. It's a hearty soup full of more dill than usual (is that why Sodikoff named his former Jewish Deli ""Dillman's?"") and big chunks of hearty onions and carrots. It seriously tastes like something that would come out of your Jewish grandmother's kitchen.All in all, it was a good experience with decent service. I'm not sure I'd wait for two hours for the burger but then again, I wouldn't wait two hours for almost any food in the entire world. The place is definitely not a healthy option, but if you can cheat a little on that or don't eat healthy anyway, then definitely go here and try the food."
Had a really good experience here. Had the burger with bacon and fried egg which was well seasoned and just great all around. Likes the atmosphere and the music. Great place
"Sweet Mother Of Burgers..!  Excellent..!  The multi-patty with the bacon and fried egg is spectacular..!  The fries are just as incredible..!  We also tried the home-made hot bologna sandwich and that was also superb..!  Service is smart and crisp but the wait time can get bad.  Regardless, for me and my husband, we're hooked..!"
"Au Cheval all I can say is "" oolala"" the atmosphere is very hipsterish, and hey we know hipsters know how to get good food so we roll with it. I found the place to look very romantic but casual lay back at the same time, strange right? But that's how I felt about the place. You can look around and see friends having a good time, and  couples on a date. I wouldn't bring my kids here because it doesn't fit the atmosphere.  It's a the great escape from day to day hustle and bustle of life. Some times when you go there is about 30-50 minute wait. It is a popular place. It's a long wait for off the chain food! They have an open bar kitchen set up and you can see the chef's and cooks work in harmony. It's a beautiful thing to observe because as a diner it sets you at ease with the restaurant. We ordered the $14.95 single burger it's actually $10.95 but we added thick cut bacon and a fried egg on top, and we went for the crispy fries with mornray and Aioli sauce it was sexy. The burger looked sexy and the crispy fries with the two dipping sauces were off the hook! I would totally go back there because the food is worth every penny. I wouldn't go there often I would make it a special date night for me and my husband I would go back with a friend to show them what an amazing burger should taste like. We split the burger because it was too much for us to eat just one burger each. I'm glad we did that made our stomach feel less painful and our minds would be less guilty consuming all those fatty calories.Au Cheval is where it's at their burgers are bette than Kuma's corner in my opinion. I highly recommend going there if you haven't done it yet."
"OMG I DID IT. I finally went to Au Cheval, after walking by so many times and two sadly unsuccessful attempts. They are TINY, and there is almost always a wait...The wait at around 11:30pm was quoted to be 30 minutes, but we were offered counter seats after probably 15 min but waited for a table. Last time, we were quoted 50 and put our names down but decided to leave after 15 or so and was texted back that we had seats at 25 minutes - so I'd say it's worth taking your chances even if the quoted time is higher than you'd like.They shut down the full kitchen probably around midnight because when we sat down we were told that soon all that would be available are burgers and drinks. The espresso machine was shut by then too, so the only coffee option they had was a $7 (!!) french press. I guess that's where their ""diner"" concept comes in, because at the end of the day it tasted a bit like diner coffee...So we ordered chicken liver appetizer just before the kitchen closed. It looked a bit like cat food (sorry), and we weren't even hungry since this was second dinner, but the first bite was... perfect. PERFECT balance of saltiness, creamy liver and complementary dill on perfectly toasted bread. Then take a bite of pickle to cut that richness. My mom used to make me eat completely dry grainy overcooked chicken liver because it was good for me. This changes everything! This dish is a MUST. TRY. The burger. I wish I read reviews because the waitress didn't even warn us that a double is a triple -.-; It's funny that they give you a steak knife because this burger can totally be a knife-and-forker. But think before you act, because if you pick it up wrong with your hands the first time, you've ruined all hopes of eating it without getting a huge mess, and by then it's too late to go to knife+fork :( It was damn good though, at least the bites that comprise of all the components. Hits the spot.The side of fries ($6 for a huge serving) comes with the most amazing garlic aioli I've ever had, unique for having an extra hit of acidity and super pronounced garlic flavor. There's nothing like it. Lastly, the tiny overhead lighting provided for each table... It's so dark in there, but the small light makes all the difference while you're sitting right below it but doesn't take away from their overall desired ambiance. Brilliant! It so helps to be able to see the color of your food...Seems like they are very consistent at delivering all their hits. For an elevated diner/pub concept, skip Little Goat and come here instead. Worth the wait. Lives up to the hype. But don't bother with the coffee."
Amazing food! The only complaint I have is the long wait.
"I had a really bad experience here. We waited 45 minutes for a table and I was treated very poorly by a waitress while waiting. I asked if they had any beer in bottles and she replied ""we're not that kind of place!"" In a very rude tone. The fries are great. The bathroom was dark, dirty and scary. The ambiance is cute, but the staff is very pretentious and alienating. Drinks are overpriced.I had heard that Au Cheval served ""the best burgers in Chicago"" and got nothing that was even close to being a ""best burger."" Do not order the side of pickles, gross and waste of money. The burger are enormous, but size does not equal quality. If you order a single you get two patties. If you order bacon you get the thickest slices of bacon that I've seen, but this is just a super size average burger. Unless you are the type of person that is into slopping large amount of food down their throat and don't really care about taste, you should avoid this place."
"Au Cheval is not like your typical diner, but offers a higher class ambiance with their dim lights, oversized booths, and exposed wooden and brick panels.  They even offer a full bar for you alcoholics.  I came here with two of my friends one night.  You can say we were lucky because we got the last open table.  Score!  No wait.    We've heard many great things about their upscale spin on diner food.  So we ordered an array of items to share:Crispy Fries with Mornay Sauce, Garlic Aioli, and Fried Farm Egg: we called these the fat fries.  The fries were really crispy, but the mornay sauce, aioli, and egg gave it a nice creamy and gooey texture.Thick Cut Peppered Bacon: I'm not much of a bacon lover, but this bacon is like no other bacon I have ever tasted.  It's definitely a thicker type of bacon with a higher meat to fat ratio, but still really tender.  But warning, if you aren't a fan of pepper I would pass on these.  It is really peppery.  Single Cheeseburger: when people say this is the best burger offered from any diner, they were not lying.  Everything about this burger was perfection.  The meat was cooked at a medium rare which left the patty really juicy, the egg was still runny so it goo all over the patty flawlessly, and the bun was butter just right that it tied everything together.  If this doesn't make you order the burger, I don't know how else to persuade you.Toasted Open-Faced Ham & Cheese Fondue w/ a Fried Egg:  this was also another delicious dish.  This is a play on ham and cheese sandwich.  It's a gooey and creamy goodness in a plate.  Put as little or as much as you want on the toasted bread.  It can get a little salty though if you run out of bread.Fried House-Made Bologna Sandwich:  probably my least favorite dish out of the bunch, but it wasn't bad.  I'm just not a huge fan of bologna.  It was kind of overly salty for my liking and nothing made this sandwich stand out from other diners' sandwiches.If you're in the mood for some diner food but don't want the typical diner food, go check this place out.  The service here was ok, could have been a little better.  But eh, the food compensated for it.  I would probably hit this place up again, even if there was a wait time (it's just ever so sweeter when there isn't.)"
"I love this place!  I always have great drinks and a delicious meal!  In the past, I've only had one complaint: the wait.  This place is a cult favorite so I am used to expecting it.  After this weekend, I also want to talk about the chiliquiles!  They were AMAZING!  I know everyone goes for the burger, but it's definitely worth going after midnight for this delicious snack that could easily feed four!"
"Service from barmaids was very poor. Food and drinks are good. Open late.Sure they have a fine burger. Nothing to make it a cornerstone to the place. Over hyped and thus disappointing. I can't believe all the ravings in other reviews about the burger but I can name several places in Cincinnati that can out burger this place any day of the week. Loud proud, good location, there isn't much else to chose from later in the night and thus this can be your best choice at the right time of day.If the service wasn't a pain on each of my visits I would have given it three stars but when service shows me a bad face more than once I have to report it."
"Came in on a Tuesday night at midnight and got their late-late-late meal menu. Myself and two friends practically ordered everything on that late menu but I only had the Chillaquiles chips and their eggs + fries. The chillaquiles chips were B O M B! The chips were fried, fresh and crunchy. It was topped with jalepenos, fresh guac, sour cream, cilantro, cheese, and some other sweet garnishes. I absolutely loved it. The eggs + fries however was not that great. a bit too sour while the chillaquiles chips were sweet.My friends both got single cheeseburger with the syrup honey bacon add on. One loved the burger, the other said it was too sour/tangy.After that we finished it off with the gelato, and O M G! yes yes yes!! so delicious. They purchase it directly from a Gelato shop in Chicago. they offer three flavors, mint peppermint, seasalt caramel and a chocolate one. we got the sea salt caramel and chocolate. I would definitely recommend this spot. Cant wait to try the spot during its regular menu."
"Not much more needs to be said about Au Cheval. I certainly don't think I'll be mentioning anything new. But when my world is rocked, I feel compelled to share.Most importantly - I find Au Cheval's burger to be transcendent. Sure, sure, most of the reviews say that. And you, like myself before the Au Cheval experience, are probably thinking: ""It's a burger. I've had tons. How much better can it get?"" There's another level, and it's at Au Cheval.Before Au Cheval, I thought that there were essentially three classes of burger. The top 20%, which are great, but relatively indistinguishable at that level. The middle 70%, which are pleasing but nothing to write home about. Then the bottom 10%, which are an insult to burgers and have made a disastrous mistake.Then I went to Au Cheval, and I found a new tier. The Au Cheval, the one percent. And the beautiful thing is, they don't do anything dramatic or different. The single is two, fairly thin patties, covered with cheese, and a thick slab of bacon (do it). The patties themselves are fantastic - the meat is well seasoned, and has a very powerful and rich umami flavor. The bacon is phenomenal, though at this thickness, its basically pork belly. The ingredients, while all very burger typical, are perfectly executed and balanced. Everything else about Au Cheval is great as well. The diner vibe, the bloody mary, the horse's neck, the old fashioned, the bone marrow, the chilaquiles - all of it tremendous. But that burger is all I need.(Apologies for the high expectations. I'm a big fan of setting expectations low and being overwhelmed. So I changed my mind. The burgers suck.)"
"Been meaning to try this place for quite some time. Located in the West Loop, its near other cool restaurants along the Randolph street strip. From the outside, the restaurant looks pretty unassuming with tinted windows, where you can't see much of outside at all.We came here on a semi-warm spring day -- mid 70s. Although it seems like they have AC, they opted to just have the front door open. Inside, its an open kitchen setup, where on the right side was the kitchen and counter tops, and the right side and back were the dining area. The place isn't that big... I guess it fits about 40 people or so.Anywho, the menu totes a lot of breakfast items. Going there for lunch, I didn't want anything that was breakfast, so I ordered the cheeseburger. And oh my, was it a mighty fine ass burger. You have the option of bacon or an egg and I opted for the egg. The burger was big enough to split in half and have it as a second meal/snack, or you can go balls to the wall like my coworkers did and gorge and waddle your way back to the office. We also ordered some fries to share and it had the right amount of crisp to it. It came with garlic aioli which was a perfect dipping sauce. Overall, great food, small venue, so come here early or expect to wait.BATHROOM REVIEW: Bathrooms located near the back, it is a one-stall Mens bathroom. It had a latch lock where every mofo has touched, so that was a little gross, but I rather lock the door then have a dude walk in on me with ma pants down. Inside, it is rather spacious, with one toilet and a long sink. Bathroom was relatively clean. Sit or squat? Oooh, thats a tough one, but I'll go with squat."
"A lot of hype about this place and it's fair that there is. Went here on a Saturday at 1, naturally there was a wait so we put our names in and gave her my number so she could text me when the table is ready.   Went next door to grab a beer while we waited.  By 130, we were seated.  We were seated at the bar which was a cool experience watching the cooks work like a well oiled machine.  Server was great and very friendly.  We already knew what we wanted to order.  Obviously the burger and the foie gras and eggs.  Husband was disappointed that the fried chicken was not on the menu for lunch, he was very much looking forward to it.  I can't say much that hasn't been said before.  The burger is extraordinary.  I am a girl who loves her burgers and have had my share.  It's excellent.   The foie gras and eggs if VERY rich but so delicious.  Perfectly cooked eggs and a wonderful sauce with perfectly cooked foie gras.  What's not to love??  Ordered a bloody and it was a really good bloody not with all the ridiculous accompaniments that you see these days.  Just a good old fashioned bloody.  I will definitely be back!"
"Agh. I know I'm going to get a lot of heat for giving Au Cheval 3 stars, but to me, it was average. Tuesday night and the wait for two was an hour. There are so many good places to eat in Chicago, so that is just ridiculous to me. It's such a small restaurant with limited seating so definitely plan ahead. The honey fried chicken (~$18 & 5/5) - oh my god were these good. An enormous platter of chicken (easily feeds two) smothered in a sweet glaze. It is perfectly fried and immediately coated with the honey glaze that it keeps its crispness til the end. Yummmmmmmmm. Seriously, every bite was delicious. Hash browns with duck gravy (1/5) - I'm not sure what prompted us to order such a thing but we barely touched it. Hash browns with duck sausage smothered in duck gravy. It didn't have the most flavor as every bite was overpowered with the not so fun melt in your mouth fat, very overwhelming as it coats your entire mouth. It was just not for us. Fries - they're a side of fries for $6. Comes with some garlic aioli on the side which neither of us were biggest fans of. Two vodka sodas, fries, and two entrees ran about $60 which wasn't bad. Service is really friendly and the kitchen is quick. The open kitchen concept is pretty cool too. Glad I experienced it, won't be back any time soon."
A great burger. Great beer selection. Service was great. Thanks Dan for making a great time at the bar. Only down size is the wait time. Can take hours to sit down. You can wait and have a good time and atmosphere with great people and music. Will return.
"This review (about 2 months late) is for poor service on the part of a waitress who I'm hoping was on her period the Sunday afternoon my niece and I had brunch there. After we copped a seat in the first come first served bar area, this chic seated us finally acknowledged us, gave us menus and then proceeded to wait on 3 guests before us, all of whom were seated after she gave us menus. She was visibly pissed that I motioned to her, and became even more pissed when I asked her if she forgot about us (to which she replied: ""What would you like to order?"", to which I replied: ""Is there a reason why 3 tables were seated and waited on 15 minutes before I motioned for service?"", to which she replied, after rolling her eyes at me: ""It's a really busy place,"", to which I replied: ""I know it's busy because I come here often, but why did you wait on 3 tables before us?"", to which she replied with a long, cold stare before saying: ""What would you like to order?"", to which I replied: ""I need to speak to your manager."", to which she rolled her eyes and stormed off.A manager came over, who was super nice but unfortunately apologetic for her horrible behavior. I proceeded to ask him the same questions I asked her. After he realized he couldn't use the ""we're really busy"" line on me, he quickly apologized, which as a customer, that's really all I wanted from the evil-bleeding waitress who overlooked us in the first place.After trying to decide if I wanted to stay, I realized this was their Strike 2; Strike 1 is the stable of rude and cocky hostesses with the power of the pen who use their power to rule the world by determining who gets in and how long people wait, but I can usually dismiss them because it must be hard to be nice to a cattle of Hipsters while waiting on the next reality tv auditions to roll through Chicago. Then I looked around and thought maybe that idiot was discriminating against us because we were the only people of ""noticeable"" color in the place, but I thought, if someone is racist in 2015, I only feel pity for them, besides, thousands of Black people lost their lives fighting for my dumb ass to wait over an hour to overpay for a burger, but that's my choice because ""dat burger is gud"" [ebonics intended]. Nevertheless, I am giving them one more chance, especially given that everything else that's great anout the place should not be blamed for my P.M.S.ing waitress. I pass the restaurant everyday, wanting a burger, yet not feeling the people who are waiting in line BEFORE the place opens. I think that's part of their brand, but I can't be that person (I've mastered a plan to never wait more than 30 minutes). I'm still on my hiatus, more than anything because I have spent thousands of dollars on food up and down Randolph street and NEVER received poor service (even attitudes) from any of the other restaurants, from Girl and the Goat/Little Goat to G.E.Bistro to City Winery to Belly Q. And more importantly, when they do make missteps, they acknowledge them and apologize. So if there is one thing I would recommend to Au Cheval, use this as a training moment and do not disregard this review as being written by a crazy person, because I love your place (and the ambience and music even more). Besides, I'm sure I will give the hostess a fake name when I return to avoid the backlash. And one last thing, people should know that everything is fried in Pork fat, which I love, but my Muslim friends do not :-) :-("
"Best. Burger. Ever.I've been here a few times now and each time I love it a little bit more.  There is almost certain to always be a wait, but the host/hostess will take your cell number and text you when your table is almost ready.  Go grab a quick drink nearby while you wait.  Sitting at the bar is very entertaining as you can watch the chefs cook a number of different dishes.  I now feel that I have to go back and try one of everything, but it will be hard to ever veer away from that burger again.  I tried the fried bologna sandwich once because I heard it was good.  It wasn't bad, but I was kicking myself as I watched the rest of the table devour their burgers.  The fries are also a must!  They don't come with the burger which requires a side order, but one order is enough for two people to split and they are amazing!"
"Came here with a group of friends on a Saturday night. We were told the wait was four hours, but it was actually half that. Don't let the ""wait time"" discourage you. Seriously, stay.What we ordered:-burgers with bacon and fried egg: Everyone at my table got it except for me. I sampled some of the girlfriend's burger and it was great. GET THE BACON AND FRIED EGG.-bone marrow, beef cheek marmalade, and toast: I ordered this to check out their take on bone marrow, which I'm used to eating in noodle soups. The amount of marrow was decent, but the flavour was meh since the marmalade overpowered it. The marmalade was a great combination of sweet and savoury. And the toast they serve? Garlic toast, aww yeah.-thick cut bacon: Now, you might think the price is a bit steep but how often are you going to have life changing bacon? The taste and texture reminded me of samgyupsal and pancetta. I can dig a good pork belly.-fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli, and a fried egg: fried egg on anything is good. The sauce was nice and creamy (cheese based?) and the garlic aioli was good. Definitely tasted the garlic. I really liked the overall marriage of the flavours. Oh yeah, I guess the ambiance was nice and all. Two candles per table, so it was rather dark. Pretty crowded too, for obvious reasons. Bacon."
"Sat at the bar, and i noticed the cooks NEVER wash their hands after touching raw meat.  They then touch buns/fries and other cooked items with RAW meat on their hands. I went to the Website to City of Chicago Food Inspections!!  They are marked a HIGH Risk and the food inspectors noticed the same thing - improper handling of food!  data.cityofchicago.org/H…While this place is good - this place is a health risk!!  AVOID"
"I have been wanting to get out to Au Cheval for such a long time but whenever I am in the area it is absolutely packed. As fate would have it, I was in the area late on a weekday night and saw that there was no line (a first!). I had imbibed more than my fair share of drinks at the previous event I had been attending so I knew food was essential to start the next morning off right. With Au Cheval presenting itself so perfectly how could I say no?We went inside and were seated immediately at a table for two. Despite it being close to midnight, the place was still jam packed. We were just lucky to arrive as another couple was leaving. We sat down and immediately knew what we wanted off the menu: double cheeseburger (no pickles) and fries with garlic aioli. My friend also got a bloody mary (she had even more drinks than me and was ready to keep going).The bloody came out first and was super spicy. The beer on the side was nothing great (she actually said she didn't like it and had expected to be able to choose her own beer). Up next were the fries. When I say these were some of the best fries of my life I may simply believe this because I was drunk. Then again, I don't think so because they had a perfect crisp and flavor with absolutely nothing on them. Add on the garlic aioli and you are literally in heaven.Finally, the double cheeseburger arrived. When I say this was a monster, I have to say it was a real monster. I know the menu said double but it actually three patties on it. A delicious horseradish sauce and plenty of cheese made this the perfect way to end an amazing night of food, fun, and drinks."
"Another burger review? Yup... I think I need to cut down on my addiction to beef patties topped with cheese and toasted buns. Is there a group for burgaholic anonymous meetings? I think I need help.My addiction has brought me to Chicago and to a place rated by Bon Appetit as a perfect griddle burger. The place is called Au Cheval. Au Cheval is a high-end diner that serves their customers until 1AM. They also serve wines and beers from different zipcodes. Aside from their famous burger, they also offer some gourmet and upscale options like bone marrow and foie gras. They have the out of the ordinary as well such as chicken liver and duck heart. There are bold options and the safe options. The burgers, i'll put them down under the safe options. When its safe, it must be good.I went to Au Cheval on a late Saturday night. I got there around 9:30PM. That late at night, the wait time was two and a half hours. So plan ahead and get ready to wait for a very.. very.. very long time. It would help they had more seats at their bar. Unfortunately, only 6 seats at the bar were available for waiting guests. With a wait time that long, you might as well just get a reservation for the 6 bar seats. Luckily, their staff is very attentive. Which was a big plus. Someone spotted us waiting by the bar and immediately offered us their bar menu. The drinks made the wait a little more bearable amidst the very lightly lit room. I say lightly lit to a point that you would need your phone light just to read the menu. Blame it on the concept. It was supposed to make the place feel cozy, private and a little mysterious.Like I said, service wasn't bad at all. Though the wait time was for more than 2 hours, we were given a seat at the bar an hour early. Not to say one hour and a half of wait time while standing was fun. Food was served fast and it was served hot. Too hot in fact I burned my tongue on my first bite of the beef cheek marmalade that was served together with the bone marrow. I always find it nice when servers warn me to be careful if they are serving charcoal hot food. I just didn't get that warning from my server. Combine that with more than an hour of waiting to eat, you have disaster. Oh.. I had disaster.The food was really good but it wasn't over the top good.Let me start with the roasted bone marrow served with beef cheek marmalade and toast. The bone marrow was cooked well. It was creamy, salty and very fresh. On a toast and together with the sweet and chewy beef cheek marmalade, it was a bite of flavor and texture explosion. My favorite of all the layers was actually the beef marmalade. Overall combined, it did not wow me as much as the cost. At $17.95, this bone marrow breaks my bone just a little too much.Let's get to the burger. DO NOT EXPECT GOURMET BURGERS. Their burgers are very simple. It had layers of beef patties, cheddar cheese, light spread of dijonnaise, thin slices of pickled dill and toasted bun. I ordered the double cheeseburger which actually had 3 layers of beef patty. The beef component was seasoned well. You can taste the freshness of the beef that was used for the burger. I did miss some of the fat component that I expect from a burger patty. I think the burger lost a lot of the moisture from the griddle. The patties came out a little dry. The cheese however was perfectly melted. It hugged that beef patty like a cheese blanket. I ordered the burger with bacon and fried egg. In my opinion, it took away the focus out of the simplicity of the burger. If I get a chance to try this burgers again, I'll stay away from the fried egg and bacon. The bacon is really good (in fact, the best of my meal). There is a reason why the menu says cheeseburger not cheeseburger with bacon and egg. Overall, keeping the simplicity of the burger was really brave since the price was a whopping $12.95. At that price, i was expecting gold on my burger. The only gold I found on my burger was the cheddar cheese. The rest was plain, simple and ordinary.Dining at Au Cheval taught me a few things. Not all things famous are good. It applies to celebrities, so why not food? Not all things are worth the wait. I waited for an hour and a half to try their burgers. I could have gone to a certain in and out place or a place where I can be greeted by a clown and maybe get myself the same burger satisfaction without the wait time. Au Cheval is a nice place. But, really? Is Au Cheval burger worth the time and $12.95 of my hard earned money?Read my other reviews at themealexperience.blogsp…"
Best burger & best bone marrow I've ever had. Line is as aggressive as the food is worth the wait.
"The hype is real, we d the double cheese with bacon and egg, eggs and fois gras, and chicken wings. The food was beyond amazing, atmosphere was great (outkast playing in the background). The wait was less than half the time we were told at check in. Definitely will be back"
"Two hour wait? It better be good! After being picked up from the airport without even a chance to freshen up and change from our travel clothes, our host brought us straight to Au Cheval. It was a two hour wait, but we walked across the street to grab some beers at Haymarket to kill some time. This place is known for having the best burger, but I can't comment on that since I don't eat beef. I know, I know. However, the three other people dining with me said it was fantastic and they all gobbled them up with added bacon and fried eggs. They looked delicious. I went for the open faced ham and cheese fondue. It came with four pieces of thick buttery grilled toasts and a delicious mixture of melted cheese and ham with a sunny fried egg on top. Oh, man! We also got two orders of french fries and mashed potatoes with garlic gravy. We ended up using the mashed potatoes and gravy as a dipping sauce for the fries. This was absolutely delicious. The restaurant itself is cozy and dimly lit, but the best part was all of the old school hip hop they were playing. When I heard Deltron 3030 I knew I was exactly where I needed to be."
"My girlfriend and I decided to eat at Au Cheval for Valentine's Day. The 2 hour wait was well worth it. I strongly recommend the single cheeseburger with egg and the garlic fries. The way the burger is seasoned and the tenderness of the meat are nothing short of amazing. As I was savoring every bite, I decided there was no other proper way to wash it down than with a beer. The restaurant has a wide variety of beers to satisfy every taste bud. Lastly, the server continued to use formalities with me, even though he knew I was younger - which I thought was commendable.If you do not like dimly lit places, this is not the place for you. Also, they do not ask how you would like your burger cooked, so if you like it prepared in a special way you must request while asking.10/10, would definitely come here again."
"Au Cheval has been on my radar for quite a while but the lengthy wait is a major turn off. I consider myself a burger enthusiast so my boyfriend and I took the plunge and decided to handle the wait. We went earlier and the wait was luckily only about 45 minutes, yup...at Au Cheval that's considered not a bad wait. I was lucky to snag a seat at the bar and my boyfriend and I ordered a couple of beers while we waited. The beers, in my opinion were excellent. Au Cheval has a fantastic beer selection.  Alas, our hostess came over and showed us to our seats which were in the back of the already small and forcefully intimate space. Usually I do not like crammed spots but for how small the place, it's not unbearably tight. I was comfortable and relaxed. I do believe the low lighting and hip decor really helped. OBVIOUSLY, we ordered their signature burger, which FYI - THE SINGLE comes with two patties, and the DOUBLE comes with three patties. Our waitress did not inform us of that so my boyfriend and I ordered doubles... Let me tell ya, that was just way too much meat. I will order a single next time. Anyway, the burger was FANTASTIC. The burgers are cooked to a medium temp, and the patties are lightly beaten making them thinner allowing the stack of three patties to not look or feel overwhelming huge or obnoxious. The flavors in the patties really came through and each bite was better than the next. I actually really enjoyed that the only toppings on the burger was melted cheese and a layer of onions and pickles drenched in dijonnaise. Another quick note, the burgers do not come with sides! Honestly, if you are there for the burger, one side is good enough for two people. My boyfriend and I ordered fries and their smashed potatoes with garlic gravy (deeelicious), and we hardly finished our sides. I really enjoyed my experience (minus the wait). Well done Au Cheval! I will be back!"
"Well, looks like I've just found my new favorite restaurant in Chicago!!! Tried it for the first time on Wed (what took me so long?!) and came back again 2 days later.1st visit: I'd always wanted to try Au Cheval, but the inability to make reservations there always discouraged me from going. After work, I walked over to see if I could snag a spot for just 1 person... yesss I was seated at the bar right away. This was my first time eating alone at a restaurant - I thought it would feel awkward, but my waiter was extremely friendly & helped me narrow down my choice (so difficult when I literally want to devour every single item on the menu). I ordered the foie gras with scrambled eggs on toast, and IT WAS AMAZING. Each bite tasted like heaven. I will admit that it was a bit on the heavy side, so maybe sharing with someone else would be more wise.2nd visit: My friend saw a picture of my foie gras and asked if I wanted to come with her again... UM.. YES! In total, we ordered the crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy, hamburger with fried egg, foie gras with eggs (again), and each got a rootbeer float. Yeah, it's pretty obvious that we couldn't finish all that food already, but to top it off... the waiter remembered me (I think) and gave us a plate of bacon on the house. (This bacon literally changed my previous perception of bacon as dry, tasteless, too-oily and thin ----- to thick, juicy, flavorful... perfection). Best meal in a long time.I really could not compliment this restaurant enough. Food, ambience, service... everything. YOU MUST TRY IT. ESPECIALLY THE FOIE GRAS."
"When someone asks me what the best burger place in Chicago is, without a doubt I can give you the answer in my sleep. Au Cheval is the real deal when it comes to satisfying those burger cravings. Flavorful and delicious, this West Loop sensation is a gem of a find. I was introduced to Au Cheval last year, when a friend of mine took me here for late night dinner and drinks. Not expecting much out of a late night diner, to my surprise I was blown away with the experience more so then anything else. This hipster New York style old school diner, with exposed brick walls, booths near the kitchen/bar area and outstanding selection of hip hop classics sure got my attention from the moment I walked through the door. And for those wanting a little more action, there are stools located around the bar area that put you right in front of the kitchen crew where you see all the magic happen all while enjoying their wonderful creations. Aside from the overall experience this is not your typical romantic environment, it is loud, fast paced, and energetic atmosphere, so I advise you not to come here expecting to have intimate time with your significant other. Another downside is the wait time, so give yourself some time (2-3hrs at the most). Trust me it is worth the wait!Weather it is for brunch or late night dinner, this diner goes from day to night serving their master creations. What makes this place exceptional is the entire experience, and last but not least their food takes the number one spot. From their delicious fried egg on pretty much anything imaginable, outstanding burgers, their one of a kind chilaquiles and not to mention their amazing selection f cocktails/beers. There is no way you can go wrong with anything else on the menu, because it's all spectacular. Overall Au Cheval is your ultimate go to place when you're in need some serious comfort food and some good vibes. But most importantly their burgers off course! Hope your experience was just as memorable and enjoyable as mine!"
"Best burger I've ever had. Whenever someone comes in from out of town, I take them here (schedule permitting). I want everyone to experience this wonder of Chicago.My go-to order: single (two patties) cheeseburger with thick-cut bacon, fries with garlic aioli, and the Dr. Devon's Pickleback. Drool...Other dishes I've tried:- Crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy: fantastic, and I'm not normally a sweetbreads kinda guy- Crispy Fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli & fried farm egg: used to order this until I'd realized that the regular order of fries came with garlic aioli as well. Mornay sauce and egg weren't necessary for me to inhale these delicious fries.- Roasted marrow bones, beef cheek marmalade & toast: so rich, so delicious.- Matzah ball soup: best I've had, but I think I've only had it one other time :-/- General Jane's honey-fried chicken with chili, sesame seeds and cilantro: decent fried chicken, but wasn't too memorable for me. Probably because every time I'm here, I just want the burger!- Fried house-made bologna sandwich: disappointing, considering that it was their staple until the burger came along. The flavors didn't mix so well in my mouth.Wait times vary:- Came on a Thursday night (~7:00pm) with roommate. Took about 1.25 hours to get seated at the bar (I think there was something going on at the United Center).- I've arranged a few Saturday evenings with a group of 8+ friends. We'll typically put down a name and cell #, then head to Haymarket kitty-corner to this place. ~1 hour wait. Had to split up into separate tables.- Came on a Thursday evening (~4:45pm) with 3 coworkers. Seated almost immediately, but had to wait for the kitchen to open at 5pm."
"We visited Au Cheval on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm. The place was super tiny and our party of 6 was given a wait time of an hour and fifteen minutes. We saw a bunch of seats at the bar and asked if we could be seated there, but for whatever reason, we couldn't. So after deliberating, we decided to wait. We waited inside for a few minutes before feeling super claustrophobic and waiting outside in some light rain (wish they had more covered waiting area if they're so crowded). The bartender was kind of rude. We were talking about the bloody mary ingredients and my friend was just looking at what toppings they had and the bartender said (twice!) ""Don't touch those ingredients"". Really?? Why would we touch toppings we know will be on peoples drinks... and no one was even close enough for her to think they were being touched... Thankfully, we didn't wait more than 35 minutes before they asked us if we wanted to try to squeeze into a booth. We said that was perfectly ok and sat down. The restaurant itself is super adorable. The decor is cute, there was a huge mirror right next to us which definitely gives the restaurant a bigger feel. My complaint was the LEGIT bumpin' music. It got super annoying and I was sober and not hungover, I cannot even imagine how annoying it is for those who stop in hungover for brunch. The restaurant temp was set way too high in my opinion and it was super warm in there - pretty uncomfortable.The hostess somehow found out that the reason we were all together that morning for brunch was partly due to the fact that one of our friends there had lost her mom the day before. She was super sympathetic, talked to my friend for a bit, and sent over some complimentary muffins. Totally unnecessary but just a nice gesture. I thought they were alright. A bit dense and dry, but super moist once I lathered it with their delicious butter. For drinks, I ordered the bloody mary, which was decent. I also ordered the coffee which was amazing. Probably because they make it in a french press and set the press in front of you. Super strong, fresh, and delicious. And, of course, glasses upon glasses of water since it was so warm.For a meal, I got the chilaquiles. Never had this before but I FELL.IN.LOVE. Messy nachos with eggs and cheese and salsa and jalapeños and sour cream (and some more toppings??).. YES please. SO good. I also had a side of their hash browns with some cheese (should have specified shredded since they put slices of cheese on top... hate when places do that). But the hash browns were pretty good. My friend said the bread was really good, so I had a bite of one of my friends toast, definitely yummy. The other girls got scrambled eggs (looked creamy and delish), cheeseburgers (3 of them), and there was a salmon dip special that one girl got. Everyone REALLY enjoyed their meal.Overall, this place was decent. Food was good, service (overall) was good, although we encountered the rude bartender and one rude server when we were waiting for a table. I was not a fan of the music and the restaurant was super tiny, cramped, and warm. I probably won't be back since I try something new every time I'm in Chi. But, my friends who live there did say that they only have a few places that they actually frequent (since there's so much to try) and Au Cheval is one of them."
"The wait was 15 minutes, cocktail - horses neck was delicious, the burger was one of my top 3 I've ever had, and the fries should be illegal.. Twice fried with mornay sauce, are you kidding me? I've been dreaming about ever since.  It also looks like they make fresh mille feuille, but I had forged on too much mornay sauce and fries to manage it. I will be back, possibly tomorrow!"
"I've been to Au Cheval a bunch of times and it's always with out of towners to get the burger. It's a great burger. If you aren't getting it with bacon and an egg on it, you're doing it wrong. The burger is huge, though, so you might want to split it or plan to take half home. They've got some amazing fries too, so get an order for the table to split. While you're waiting for your burger, I suggest a pickle back shot. It's a shot of whiskey, chased but a shot of pickle juice. It's surprisingly good and the pickles juice always puts me I  the mood for a burger. They don't take reservations, so we usually put our names in and go next door to Lone Wolf to drink for a while. They'll call your cell when they're ready."
"Probably my favorite burger in all of Chicago!  We came here on a Friday night at 5:00 and had to wait about 1.5 hours to be seated for 4 people. We just hung out at the bar next door until they text us our table was ready.Their burgers are HUGE! So don't load up on apps! Make sure you stick with the single cheeseburger (It comes with 2 pattys) if you go double, you won't be able to move... I got the bone marrow and fries as sides, I probably could have done without the bone marrow, it was a little too much food.Also if you are a fan of bacon, make sure you get bacon on your burger, it's the most unique bacon you'll ever have! It's literally a half inch thick, I've never seen anything like it before. Also they have great rootbeer here!"
"I immediately wanted to go here seeing they played their music from a reel to reel player, but it took me about a year to finally go as I had moved out of the city. My cousin used to work here so I had to ask him what was good on the menu since I'm a very picky eater. I haven't had Bologna in probably 10 years but when I heard they make their own, I had the friend bologna sandwich with a side of their smashed potatoes. There was WAY too much bologna on the bun to even fit in my mouth so I took a lot off, but none the less it was great. The garlic aioli in the smashed potatoes was perfect. I have also never had Matzo Ball soup until that night, I was definitely a fan and I've been craving it every day since then. My friend had just a plain cheeseburger and said its one of the best he's had.On another note, I didn't realize that once I got in there I was on a time crunch, we just let our waiter know even though it was a full house, but he hit that chef to push our order out very fast!!"
"Hands down, best burger in the city, and possibly best I've ever had. Dreaming of going back.....YES, you will expect to wait if you go anytime after 4:30PM, but it's totally worth it."
"Best burger in Chicago. Hands down.  I had a burger with the egg on top and my husband had the same with bacon added.  We shared the fries... which were fried in duck fat.  So we were VERY happy.  Good service, clean, neat atmosphere... and did I mention that it is the BEST BURGER IN CHICAGO."
If I could give 10 stars I would. I came here last night with my boyfriend finally and it definitely loved everything about this place.It's not huge so you can expect a bit of a wait but service is great either at the bar or a table.I had a burger which was melt in your mouth amazing. Great selection of beers as well. Local breweries throughout the Midwest kind of beers. Definitely will be back!
"Long lines but worth the wait. Very friendly and accomodating staff. Order the bone marrow, foie gras, chicken liver and salmon. All amazing and will leave you extremely full."
"Believe the reviews! The burgers probably ARE the best in Illinois and probably further. Simply dressed as opposed to places that pile crap on their burgers to disguise lack of beef flavor.  As for the bacon. I don't know if my vocabulary skills can do it justice.  It's not that over-smoked, smelly stuff that's  a hit or miss age-wise. This bacon is a tasty melt-in-your-mouth buttery texture up against a wonderfully crispiness all lightly coated with cracked black pepper and a sweet glaze. you should get it as an appetizer with one of the many unique beer offerings and eat it with your burger."
"One of the best burgers I have ever had, and one of the best old fashions I've had as well. (Ask for a tray of bacon)"
"This was the most unbelievable bacon-egg-cheeseburger I have EVER had in my life. Also, the fries with aioli, cheese and a fried egg legitimately changed my life.....WHAT IS THIS PLACE?! It's amazing. It's life changing. It's a culinary masterpiece. You MUST come here. Unbelievably delicious food, creative menu, kind and attentive staff, and an experience that deserves to be recognized."
"This place gets the triple B. Bomb Burgers and Bacon. Food is worth the hype. Go get it. Where this place lacks is the front of the house. My buddy places his name on the list and we were told 30 min. Fine, go across the street and get a brew while we wait. Got a text - table is ready. Boom! Mange time!We get there and FOH says we will seat you shortly, 2 people are leaving soon. No problem, we say, we will be waiting right outside. 20 min later, not one person has called my buddies name. We go inside to check and FOH says we called the name, and someone said they were us. DOUBLE U TEE EFF! Now, I get this place is bomb, but cmon people. Lie to get a seat - karma's a bitch. Just saying. Also, FOH should have recognized my buddy's face and should have known that the person claiming to be him wasn't. All FOH could say was ""it happens"" - pretty shitty on her part. Again, BOMB food and service. Shitty FOH."
"Protip #1: They don't do reservations, so put your name in, and go across the street to Haymarket for some awesome beers and a place to actually sit. You'll be crammed in the waiting area otherwise. The host/hostess will take your number down and text you when your table is ready.  *Note: they won't seat you unless your entire party is present.Protip #2: The General Jane's fried chicken is almost exactly like Crisp's Korean BBQ in Lakeview, so if you want more bang for your buck, go there!"
"You may have heard all of the hype regarding their burger. Well, I did too, and it definitely didn't disappoint.  The wait is long (they told us 5 hours, what did you expect?), but I have a secret. There are 6 bar seats that are first come first served, and nobody really waits around. We waited only 1 1/2 hours with a group of 4, and snagged some seats.  They will also serve you drinks while you're waiting.  Now, back to the food.  The burger is really nothing fancy, but is cooked to perfection and has the perfect bun to meat to cheese ratio.  You must try some apps as well.  I recommend the bone marrow or chili.  Their fries are excellent as well.  Definitely worth the wait."
"All I can say is that the burger is entirely worth it. I will probably never be satisfied by a burger back home ever again. Au Cheval set the standard high. You will likely have to wait really long time (we stopped by at 9pm on a weekday and were told the wait was 2.5 hours), but if you get there about 30 minutes before opening on a weekday you should be good (we were). Note that the bacon and egg for the burger are add-ons, so be sure to ask. I believe it also comes with raw onions, pickles, and dijonnaise. I'm still thinking about this burger weeks later. Wow. If you're visiting Chicago, you MUST stop by. It was one of the highlights of my most recent Chicago trip."
"After a morning of being cultured at the Field Museum, I needed to get back in my own element. Beer and burgers at Au Cheval was just what the Doctor ordered. This is my kind of place. A cozy little bar with great craft beers and tasty grub. The beer selection is over whelming. But with some assistance from our server, I went with the Old Rasputin. This beer may have been named after the smelly old Russian Shyster who kept the Romanov's under his fraudulent spell. But there was nothing smelly about this delicious ale.  As most of you know, I've been on a mission to find a burger that can knock Kuma's off the beef throne. The Burger at Au Cheval just misses the mark on the Kuma's scale but its still ranks up there with some of the best in Chicago. But when you consider the great Craft Beers, top notch service and good food, it warrants a five star rating."
"I'm back at Au Cheval for lunch and want to update my review!I would give Au Cheval 6 stars if I could!!!!!  What was I thinking only getting the Single without the Fried Egg and Bacon????????? Stupid move!!!!You have to try the Double Cheeseburger with Bacon and Fried Egg!!!! AMAZING!!!!!!!! This place just keeps getting better and better!!!!!I don't understand the complaints about the service, the staff at lunch is phenomenal.    The complainers probably didn't order the Double Cheeseburger!!!!!By the way, the Double Cheeseburger is really a Triple!!!  This should satisfy the big appetites.  If not, order more sides!!!This place receives 2 AMAZINGS, AMAZINGS!!!!!"
"Came here for lunch as the reviews have touted Au Cheval as having the best burger in the city. We sat at the bar so had a front row view of the kitchen. My boyfriend and I tried the burger (with bacon and fried egg) and the chilaquiles. The burger of course tasted delicious but there was a creamy white sauce to help with that. The bacon was so thick and fatty -- glad we split the burger! The chilaquiles was just okay -- didn't like how we saw how the staff fried the chips and squeeze the guac and sour cream out of plastic bags. I left the restaurant feeling pretty sick (stomach was upset and I also felt like I needed to vomit). Overall, not the best experience and likely would not come back."
"4 star average! That's mortifying! Best burger on this planet - no question. Duck fat fries - addicting. The bacon is thick, juicy, salty, and everything else you dream of. The wait can be long so walk across the street to Haymarket for a beer while you wait. I crave this place and there is no satisfying me until I have it."
Best burger? Yeah. Does it make for the lousy service? Of course not. Manager  blake is the worst guy. I could come back here forever but i wont if im treated like shit.
"I might as well have skipped college for the amount of money I spend on Sodikoff restaurants. Honestly, it blows my mind how consistent and amazing his shit is. I'm panicking as I write this, impatiently waiting for my roomie to pull it together for our ritual Sunday Au cheval family dinner. We are on about 10 in a row now and it's like my crack. I don't wait for anything; I have the patience of I what I would imagine a crack addict has. The burger is awesome. Not my favorite ever, I'm more of a huge medium rare girl, but it's awesome. And unique. The fries are insane, the chicken app is fantastic. But we order bacon for an app because you have to save it all for the main feature. I go no egg, no bacon, because of our indulgence prior, and it's better that way. The puff dessert with whipped cream is orgasmic. Staff is usually great. And I'm not a hipster."
"What an unassuming place! I seriously couldn't even tell if the place was open from the outside. I tried looking in and all you can see is a reflection of yourself. I almost moved on to another restaurant fearing that this place was closed, lucky for me someone that was also wondering the same thing tried the door, so I scurried in behind them. So glad I did. The food is amazing. The hamburger was cooked perfectly with a fried egg neatly set on top of the 3x patties, I also got the sausage over mash and the au ju gravy. Everything about this dish was fantastic, there isn't one thing I would change. My experience was great and I am so glad I stumbled upon this place."
"It must have been an off day for Au Cheval when I visited.  I had the single burger with bacon & cheese. If you are looking to die young, get the burger with bacon and cheese. The burger was saturated in grease. I couldn't get through half of it without feeling like my heart was going to stop. Don't be fooled, the bacon is extra thick, maybe a good side order to share with someone pre-burger but not on the burger."
"Every time I've tried to come to Au Cheval, there's been some absurdly long wait. Since I'm not one to wait around for a long time, it took me a while to get here.Now, I do need to note that I didn't do dinner here, but, whatever. I met a friend here for lunch as it just seemed like the thing to do. I'm sure people are expecting me to talk about the burger(s). Here's the thing, I didn't get a burger. Instead I got the egg hash and it was absolutely awesome. They certainly didn't skimp on the potato hash. This was done beautifully and then add a sunny side up egg on top, and, well, you has something utterly awesome. My lunch at Au Cheval did feel like a bit of a teaser. But, what a teaser it was. Au Cheval has been on my mind since and I need to make sure I dig more into the menu in future visits."
"The best hamburger I've ever had.  Get a single or a double, it doesn't matter.  But load it up with bacon and an egg and you are in heaven.  I describe the bacon as bacon-before-the-fall...it's the type of bacon that Adam and Eve must have enjoyed in the Garden of Eden.  It is THAT good.If you have people in your group, the pork chop is huge and it's delicious.  They only have one or two a night, but if there's a wait, you can put it on reserve.Great fries.  Great old fashioneds.  The fried chicken is very good.  If you haven't checked out Au Cheval, go right now!"
"Their burgers should get like 10,000 stars - I can't stop thinking about it!  Only reason I gave them four stars is because it's difficult to get into and they don't take reservations.  I finally went at lunch - had to arrive by 11:15.  But that burger - is SOOOOO worth it!"
"Loved it!  Came for Sunday brunch. We prepared ourselves for a lengthy wait so we got to the restaurant at 930 am, a half an hour before opening.  There were only a few other people waiting and once the doors opened we were seated right away.  My husband had the Fried Bologna Sandwich and I had the Cheeseburger with bacon. We also has Bloody Mary's to drink and I had an iced coffee as well.  Oh and who could forget the amazing French fries with a fried egg on top and delish garlic aioli.  Everything was super flavorful and cooked perfectly.  We can't wait to visit again in the near future for dinner."
"Let me start off by saying Wow! I'm a huge burger fan and I think I've found one of the best, not only in the city, but in the country. Thurman's in Columbus, OH was my favorite, but the burger at Au Cheval has taken over the top spot on my board."
"Came here for brunch with my boyfriend. The wait was over an hour and a half, so we hung around the bar and luckily got some seats. We decided to split the duck hash and we each ordered the cheeseburger. We also shared the fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli and a fried egg. For some reason, the waitress only asked me if I wanted an egg on top and didn't give my boyfriend the option. He had wanted an egg, but we didn't realize that he didn't get to ask for an egg until she had left and after that we didn't see her for awhile. We also each ordered a bloody mary. I personally didn't like it much, because I'm not a fan of horseradish. I didn't realize it would be that prominent, but that was my fault for ordering it. The duck hash was amazing, but incredibly dense and rich. After the first couple of bites, I had already started feeling full. The fries were also good. I liked the mornay sauce, but I don't think we needed the fries on top of the hash. It was all too dense and too heavy. When our cheeseburgers came, they were...good. Uh.. not really sure what to say other than that. It was actually kind of disappointing, because I thought that was their thing? Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but it was amazing either. I think I would have been just as happy with a big mac in all honesty. It was also incredibly messy and, because we were sitting at a tiny bar with about four or five other people, it was really cramped and hard to eat.Anyway, maybe I need to come when they have their regular menu (not the brunch menu), but overall I was really underwhelmed. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."
"BEST BURGER IN TOWN, Kuma's Corner is not even in the same league as Au Cheval. This place was recommended to me long before it was on ""Check Please"" or it received all its accolades. I carve it just thinking about it, the mashed potatoes take me back to childhood, they are superb. Not to mention their thick cut bacon, if you are a bacon lover you not only do you have to get it on your burger but get yourself a side of it as well. Everyone I have ever taken has been thoroughly impressed."
"THE BURGER, PEOPLE.  GET IT AND SHOVE THAT BEAUTIFUL BABY RIGHT DOWN YOUR GULLET.Totally regret not getting it the first time around, but oh-so-glad I was able to get it this time.  **Note: the single burger, comes with two patties and the double burger comes with three patties.  The double is more than enough to fill you up and even with ""nothing"" on it but cheese, pickles, some ridiculously good sauce they put on it, it is ridiculously good.  One of the best burgers I've ever had.  Hands down.Also was able to try some of the bacon after telling my brother to get his burger with bacon and an egg and holy mother of God.  That thing could be a dish in and of itself.  I use the term bacon loosely here, because it's not necessarily bacon, but a huge patty of deliciousness.  So thick, so juicy, so good (that's what she said!).Paired with the crispy fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli and fried egg and a stiegl radler?  Total party in my mouth.*Edit: bacon can be ordered as a side.  Get it, eat it, and love it, people of Yelp."
"Got a double cheeseburger with bacon and an egg.... it was delicious, the bacon is crazy thickgood beer selection too"
"The burger is fantastic. The service is really, really terrible. We waited an hour to be sat, as was expected, so no big deal at all. Once we were seated, it all went downhill. Our server takes a while to acknowledge us, but I've come to realize that service in this city is pretty subpar anyway. She comes over, we order one beer each (considering we just had two each next door, we were feeling feisty and were in a mission to definitely order more).  She is clearly not pleased with our selection, and slumps away to put in our order. Eh, maybe we won't be having more than one. We sit, we sit, we sit some more. Shall I mention we are the table directly beside the server station? Not like the place is big, anyway... Ah! Finally, nearly ten minutes later, beers arrive, only to be brought to us by another server. So, we just keep hanging out until she remembers that we are also here to dine. A while later, once she decides to acknowledge us again, she takes our order. Two double burgers, two sides. Not too shabby, right? Wrong. She clearly doesn't enjoy this selection of ours, either. We honestly don't see her again until I wave her down asking for a box - and we politely tried to make eye contact with her for quite some time before I got desperate enough to do this. She brings a box, drops the check, and leaves again with no eye contact, no ""thank you"", nothing. Hey, I get it. You hate us? We pay, we leave, we speak to a manager to let her know that things weren't great, and we just wanted her to be aware. The couple in front of us was complaining about their service as well, and the manager shrugged us all off and could not care less. I get it, Au Cheval. You're cool. But you know what? Treat enough people like sh!t and the appeal fades.  Regardless of how good the burger is, and that we live two blocks away, we will never be back."
"Yeah buddy!!  Wife and I painted the town and decided to stick our heads in here since we'd always wanted to go.  The fact that we had already had dinner, drinks at two different sports, and were really looking for an ATM machine did not stand in our way.  Seated at the bar, it is impossible not to drool; you're looking right into the kitchen prep where mouth watering burgers, some doubles, many with thick, and no, you're lying if you think you know how thick, slabs of bacon nestled atop ... almost all with cheese .  So even though we were not hungry, and even though we had already had plenty to drink; we looked at each other and ""knew"" that our desert was going to be a Burger, make that a double, with a fried egg atop.  Wife had a cider I had an IPA and the only reason I stopped at 3 stars is because I need to go back and verify he burger was as good as I thought it was.  And we are definitely going back.  Two drinks and a split burger came in at under 30 bucks ... next time we'll each order a burger as well as an order of fries (they looked amazing)."
So....what can I say first about this place. The wait is long!!! 2+ hours long....and it seems that the minute you sit down you are given water but still have to wait for drinks...and this is on a Tuesday night!We ordered the chicken liver with toast and and had a single cheeseburger and a glass of wine.The wine was good...As well as the chicken livers yet they weren't as rich as I thought. The burger though topped with bacon was good but not great. Overall if the wait for a burger wasn't that long I would have given more stars to this place. First time here but not sure if I'll come back.
"Let me preface by saying that my friends absolutely love this place. I like it a lot but I wouldn't say this is the 1 place you have to hit in the city. The burgers are cooked very well and the meat is a excellent. Top burger in the city. Word to the wise, a single is a double and a double is a triple. You can get bacon and/or an egg on your burger, of course, I got both. The waffle dessert was very good, as is the fries. My cons to the place are the wait is always very long and the prices are above where I would like to pay for the type of food I am getting."
"Love this place. Burgers are amazing, my favorite thing there so that's what I usually get. The honey fried chicken is also good. The brat and bone marrow were just ok. Decent beer and wine selection.The only thing is that it's small so there tends to be a long wait."
"Food: Hands down best burger I've had in Chicago to date. I ordered the single cheeseburger with bacon (or whatever that fantastic cut of pig was). They make one long patty and fold it to make it seem like a double but it's just a large single patty. Really simple toppings that really let the flavor combinations shine and harmonize between the burger, bacon, and cheese. I would highly recommend this combination. The group I was with also ordered the fries topped with egg, which were good but nothing compared to the burger.Booze: good selection. I ordered a cider and it went well with the burger flavors.Service: The waitress did forget about a coffee but other than that the wait staff was friendly and attentive. There was an hour wait and we just went across the street and grabbed a drink, no big deal. Overall: get the burger with bacon and leave happy!"
"Came here for lunch around 1 with my boo on a Thursday and was seated immediately. We shared a double cheeseburger au cheval with a fried egg. Also shared the bone marrow.  I wasn't sure how to eat the bone marrow. First I tasted the bread...nice and buttery. Then I tasted the jam which had a weird texture but overall I liked it on the bread. The marrow was a bit too salty for me but on the bread with jam, had a nice balance. The burger was good to me...would not say it's the best burger I've had though.  The double was way to big for me to have a good clean bite.  I may possibly be back, but I'm still on the quest to find the best burger...Service was nice, friendly, and fast.  The bathroom had a nice soap and lotion dispenser which I do appreciate :)"
"My coworkers and I had heard to expect a wait at Au Cheval. We desperately wanted to go but we did not have much time to wait because we had several more stops that night. We went to Au Cheval right when they opened back up for dinner service at 5pm. Luckily we got a table and the place was quickly packed out by 5:05pm! No joke.We ordered the crispy fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli, and fried farm egg and the roasted marrow bones, beef cheek marmalade, and toast.These were both items that I had never experienced before. The egg on top of french fries was a new concept to me. The egg itself does not add much flavor but it definitely adds a nice texture and depth to simple fries. I very much enjoyed it!The marrow bones are a new favorite of mine! The marrow tastes like very flavorful meat fat. It was easy to spread on bread and was wonderful mixed with the marmalade. It felt like quite the delicacy.The ambiance is really an experience within itself on top of the delicious food. It's spectacular to see how they have transformed such a small place!I have heard that Au Cheval has fantastic burgers! I definitely plan on coming back on my next trip to Chicago to try one.I promise, Au Cheval is a must see, must eat, must do for anyone in Chicago!"
"Best burger I've had in a long, long time. Fantastic cocktails.Knocking off a star because of wait time. Hopefully soon they expand. :)"
"I'm a burger aficionado and usually take burger recommendations from others w/ a grain of salt.  I judge my burgers by the quality and taste of the meat, not by the abundance of toppings as many do.The first stroll here was a Monday at 6:30PM. First impression was not good, there were people standing everywhere, inside, outside, everywhere. We were told the wait was 2 hours.  For a burger, no thanks, we moved on and were quickly seated elsewhere and had a great meal. Came back a few weeks later at 2:45PM when I was hoping for a quieter experience. It was still pretty packed, but I was alone so I bellied up to the bar. What's great about the bar is it's not a bar, it's actually the kitchen making your food. I've been to places that have a bar kitchen concept like this, but haven't seen it in Chicago, and I love it. I immediately ordered a nice Saison, then almost just as immediately my burger. You can add bacon and egg, I added bacon. After I ordered a ""single"" I became nervous watching as the single patties were small.  Upon receiving my burger my nervousness gave way to realizing that a single burger here is actually comprised of 2 patties, in the end resembling something akin to a single 1/2# burger.  That's a unique way of serving burgers and probably plays into the taste a lot even. A double, I'm told now, is actually a triple.Burger came, first bite was a chewy piece of the bacon I had added.  I was worried, let down even that I needlessly added bacon. But then as I carried on the rest of the burger was pretty great.  I am not entirely sure what the actual toppings were as I did not see them actually mentioned on the menu, but it appeared to be American cheese with a chopped onion and mornay / bechemal sauce.  It was still a relatively simple topping combination, but added up to greatness. And the whole thing truly unique. Still, bacon didn't seem totally necessary.I would recommend this burger. Would I wait for 2 hours? Absolutely no way. Would I wait more than an hour even? Not in Chicago. A single cheese burger w/ bacon, 1 beer, and order of fries came to $38 with 20% tip.Also, the Yelp hours are wrong. While they are open for the period of time mentioned, the kitchen actually closes at 3PM-5PM."
Love love love this place. Food was delicious and the decor was just very warm & cozy. Had to knock off one star for the long wait (1 hr & 30 mins)
"FYI:they don't take reservations so expect to wait..Brunch menu is from 10AM-3PM..they don't really have too many options on the Brunch menu if you're looking for different types of burgers & omelettes.. I came here for lunch on Sunday with a couple friends..our wait time was about 40 minutes..Food: Cheeseburger a cheval ($10.95): consisted of 2 meat patties, cheese, thick bacon (tastes like Korean pork belly), egg, onions & a pickle on the side..this is seriously a HUGE burger..delicious, but also a little salty for me with all the meat in it...overall tasty though!...I think eating just this burger would consist of my lunch + dinner because it's soo huge!!Fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli & fried farm egg ($9.95) - good to share amongst 4 ppl.. delicious and a must try!! the combination of the sauces & eggs with the fries really make it taste good!! I really enjoyed the garlic aioli compared to the mornay sauce...**the garlic aioli will taste good w/ the burger as well!Customer Service: friendly and timely.. no complaints!Wait time: expect to wait to get seated..and the restaurant is quite small so come prepared to wait outdoors (if it's cold, dress warmly!)..I would come back for the burger or fries .. or just to try some different items on their menu!"
"Auuuuuu yeah. That's how I like it, baby. Au Cheval, is another golden support to Chicago's amazing eateries. The dimly lit restaurant consisted of a talkative crowd with just as friendly servers.We started off with a salad to get some healthy and fresh greens. The bone marrow is huge and is sure to jolt your taste buds to life. The fried chicken is of the Korean bonchon influence with its crispy sauced skin and moist white meat. A cheeseburger topped with a sunny side up egg rounded out our meal and it was eggshellent."
"A few things about Au Cheval...We arrived about an hour before dinner service to have some drinks and not have to wait for a table. The booths have a nice tufted chesterfield leather look and are reallycomfortable, makes for a nice drinking session. They have a decent local craft selection with Revolution, 3 Floyds, Goose and 5 Rabbitt. Th service was definitely disappointing.. The place had about 8 customers around 4 PM.. We ordered a couple beers with our server and about ten minutes later my wife looks at me like ""are we getting our drinks""?. I said I haven't seen our server and she said she has been sitting in the booth behind us.... We got our drinks about 15 minutes after sitting down in a virtually empty place.The food service was questionable as well... The place fills up fast.. The entire back end of the place got every order taken before ours although they all arrived after us by at least 45 minutes because the sever assigned to that area was at work 30 minutes before his shift and our server arrived 2 minutes before hers.... Mightily annoying. The burger was excellent .... One of the best around....  But I'm not dying to go back and deal with the sh!t show that commenced before our food arrived. There are burgers just as good elsewhere in the city with half the issues."
The burgers are simply just mouth watering. Yes crazzzy wait times to actually sit down but You won't regret waiting once you had one of there burgers and there honey fried chicken. Great selection of beers on tap prices aren't bad either.
I have only ever dined here very late night so the menu was limited but the food was outstanding and the service impeccable even though it was packed and we were seated at the bar.  The burger here is seriously seriously good and the nacho like thing I had on the late night menu was to die for and a portion large enough the three of us could have shared one order!  I'll be back again and again!
"What more can be said about their burger?  We waited 45 minutes to sit at the bar on a Wednesday night, and I wasn't bothered one bit.  I've now been to Au Cheval twice, and every time eating their burger is like a religious experience.  I forget all of my problems and stresses, and every ounce of my energy is spent focusing on the glory that I'm consuming."
"The Burger!!!! You cannot beat the  bread and butter pickles that are made in house.  I was shocked at the 9.00 price for a side of bacon, but once I saw and tasted the bacon I completely understood.  I would gladly spend 9.00 everyday for that side of bacon.My husband ordered the opened faced ham and cheese sandwich which was delicious and a heart attack waiting to happen.  I love the gentlemen's club feel of the decor and the sink in the bathroom.  Au Cheval does dinner food right!!!"
Must agree that it's one of the best burgers I've ever had.  The burger seriously melts in your mouth.  We started with a salad with bacon on it- amazing!   Never had bacon like that!
"The wait at Au Cheval was an hour long, but that was expected, as we have attempted to wait out our hunger here a few times before. We ordered a few glasses of beer off of their very selective menu dotted with some interesting stouts. The atmosphere is bustling and pub-like; and everyone seems to be happy that they are finally seated.The menu is small, but filled with deeply-savory, soporific foods like matzah ball soup, fries with mayo, bologna sandwich, potato hash, chilaquiles, and chicken liver. It's as if the chef tested all the dishes in the world and ranked them by the fastest sleep-inducing items. All in all, the food was good, bursting with flavor. The potato hash with duck heart gravy was especially outstanding, every bit of the ugly goop was promptly spooned into my mouth."
Thee best thing I ever ate.  The burger.  The bacon.  The egg.  And oh my God the bacon! The myriad of feelings and thoughts I had when eating this burger are almost too personal and intimate to share.  Do not leave Chicago without eating this burger.Ok so now Im going to recall the thoughts and words...Sensational.  Lord have mercy.  Mind blowing.  Erotic.  Nothing compares.
"Went here for brunch with my girlfriend during the holiday seasons. There wasn't much of a wait, we were quickly seated at the corner table and handed the brunch menus.Ambiance: Small, bustling restaurant. Very dim lighting with loud music. Cramped walking space between tables. Open kitchen next to bar with counter seating.Service: Staff was very casual and friendly, asking if we had any allergies. Refilling water quite often which was nice since my girlfriend prefers drinking water.Food: Bomb! Ordered the fried egg on top of fries with garlic aioli and mornay sauce and the cheeseburger with fried egg and bacon. Really enjoyed our brunch."
OH MY GOODNESS. Best burger. EVER. If you love the burger and egg hype this is your place. The wait is ridiculous but luckily its on randolph so whatever put your name and number down and wait (usually 2 hours) at a nearby bar. Im telling do not be shocked by the wait time. ITS WORTH THE FREAKIN WAIT!! Just wait it out. Thank me later.Ps- Order the fries with the egg too. If you are thinking wait thats too much egg? Think again. Amazing.
"I have heard legend of this place for a while so I checked it out. Portions where nice sized, bloody mary was great, but that is where it ended. The burger was so loaded with salt  I could barely taste it. I couldn't figure out what happened, I thought it might be the bacon, but I was watching the guy on the grill taking way to much salt and tossing it on the burgers. Eeech. I asked the guy next to me, who ordered the same burger, he concurred. The frys where worse then mcdonalds.  For a 45 dollar bill I expected a lot better. I am hoping, for their sake, this was just an inexperienced grill guy."
"excellent burger, fries and coffee but are they REALLY worth the hype ??? I personally do not think so.....Do not go unless you are a lip reader- the very loud music makes it impossible to have a conversation ...or hear your waiter...I also find it disingenuous that extra charges for egg ( $1.00 ) and bacon ( $3.50 ) for the burger are not mentioned in the menu. My curiosity about  "" the best burger in the USA "" was satisfied but I will not be back ( and I am sure that they will do very well without my business...)."
"I love you, Au Cheval. You had me at my first step in with your music. The food was frosting on a glorious cake, and you make a Seattle girl so happy, that I'm gonna rave about you when people ask, ""Where are the best food spots in Chicago?"" If they don't go, well then that's just their dreadful loss. For those who will read this love note to Au Cheval... among their delightful yummy menu, DO NOT LEAVE without trying their fries w/mornay sauce, garlic aioli, and fried egg."
If I had a dying wish Au Cheval's single cheese burger with bacon would be it! I just went yesterday and it has been a while... they did not disappoint! WOW!!!!
"My wife and I have been meaning to go here for a while and were very excited to try it a couple of nights ago. We had to wait for an hour or so, but they took our number and we went and had a drink elsewhere, so the wait wasn't a problem for us. The atmosphere and service were nice although the tables were incredibly close to one another (we ended up having a conversation with the couple next to us).We started off with the Matzah Ball Soup. I've had an incredible amount of matzah ball soup in my day of various levels of deliciousness. The flavor of the broth was good and I was happy with the consistency of the matzah ball, but there was just waaaaay too much fresh dill overpowering the entire dish. The salt level was perfect, and were it not for the dill, I think this would have been a very solid dish. Additionally, I despised how the server kept referring to the soup as ""The Matzah."" Matzah is a different food than Matzah Ball Soup, but perhaps it was just a personal annoyance.We both got burgers and shared fries. The burger was probably my second favorite I've had in Chicago (the first is at Fatty's). I got a double, which was the perfect size for me. It was incredibly moist and juicy, and the bun was the perfect choice. I don't in any way mean this as an insult, but I thought it kind of tasted like an upscale version of a burger I might get at a little diner in how moist (and greasy) it was. I loved it. I will be back for another burger. My only complaint about the burger is that I didn't like their pickles (too bread and buttery for me), and I usually love pickles on my burger.Now, onto the fries. I am happy to say that these were the BEST fries I've had in Chicago! (And I love fries.) They were the perfect consistency: crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The garlic aioli on the side was spectacular. If fries weren't so unhealthy, I would eat these multiple times per week.Overall, we had a great experience. I have it at 4 stars due to the overwhelming dill in the soup and the extremely close tables. Perhaps they'll get a 5 update on my return..."
"This place was on my list for a while, so I was happy to be able to make it over. The place is more of a diner, and it's always packed. I had to wait around for a while before they could seat 1. They have an excellent beer list, with lots of good options. I had some Kolsch and other beers. The menu looked very good, and I had to try to famous burger. It did not disappoint, really awesome burger, and I've had a lot of burgers... The fried chicken looked great too, but I couldn't possibly do both (although the guy sitting next to me at the bar did in fact eat both himself, I was impressed)."
"Phenomenal cheeseburgers! Ordered the single and it was definitely more like a double with a perfectly runny egg and thick cut Slice bacon. Also, ordered the fries, really tasty. The aioli sauce was perfectly garlicky. Au cheval burgers could arguably be better than kumas corner, minus the variety. Will definitely come back for more!"
"OMG the environment alone should get you in this place! The place was dimly lit but very welcoming. It was a good feel vibe. I felt like I was in Cheers. I had THE cheeseburger. With the egg and bacon and it was amazing every bite! Yes, I finished it! I Alain had their amazing pork fried  fries with mayo for dipping that had some hint of garlic. All was great. People and food. Must go."
Best burger in town. All the dishes look really. Place is a bit loud but perfect if you are looking for an old school kind of join.
Love for late night drinks and eats...used to be a standby the waits have become unbearable.
"Came here bc people have been raving about the burger. Got the single cheeseburger with fried egg on top ($2 add on) and highly recommend the fried egg if you have never tried it on a burger- makes it oozy and juicy!! Can also add on bacon and it's not your ordinary bacon, but fat slabs of bacon. Was a little messy, but it came with 2 thinner meat Patty's that were flavorful, juicy, and meaty! All the burgers come medium and I thought it was perfectly cooked for me. It was comparable to shake shack burgers, but more upscale. Also, got the fries with fried egg and garlic aoli- very delicious! highly recommend this place if you are looking for a yummy burger. Get there early bc there's always a line and the place is a little small inside. I would love to try their appetizers and other entrees next time too!"
"The ambiance was dark, the space quite small. I went on a rainy Saturday with A friend and there was a 45 minute wait. The staff were completely attentive, and they shot me a text as soon as our table was available. It ended up being a 30 minute wait. The bloody Mary here has to be one of my favorites. Just the right kick with so much flavor. My friend and I split a double cheeseburger with bacon and fried egg, and also split crispy fries with aioli. The aioli sauce itself was so addicting. **I'll be completely honest here, I'm not a big fan of burgers or fries but I truly enjoyed my meal here. As a cheat meal, it was so worth it!  You can really tell they throw tons of garlic butter and green onion on everything. The flavors were a bit intense but so so delicious! I wouldn't eat here everyday, but I would definitely come back."
"Really great late night spot! Had the cheeseburger and chopped vegetable salad, both of which were really tasty and a slightly different interpretation on classic dishes. The cheeseburger came with an amazing piece of thick cut smoky bacon and a fried egg on top- really great flavors and execution. The vegetable salad was more of a shaved salad, which was a nice sized portion with a variety of fresh vegetables. All in all, great place. Only downside were the size of the booths. Biggest party they can seat is four unless you have super models in your group. We fit six but it was tight!"
"Well....if I ever had a chance to taste the food then maybe, just maybe I could have added some stars. I stopped in, was greeted by the hostess and then seated at the bar. I sat there for 15-20 minutes completely ignored. Wow...not even something to the effect of ""we'll be with you as soon as we can.""...nope nothing. The vibe I got was that they are too cool for school. That attitude needs to change or you won't be around no matter how good your food is.When telling the hostess that I couldn't wait anymore, the offered up excuse was ""we only have one server working.""...at 1130am on a weekday in the West Loop? That's hilarious."
Bone marrow + rye and ginger beer cocktail + extraordinary burger + early-'90s Snoop Dogg = a superlative casual dining experience.And that fried bologna is simultaneously one of the strangest and best-tasting sandwiches I've ever come across.
"So the hype is real and warranted.  It took us 4 tries to get into the place, but it was well worth it. Finally lining up right when it opened got us a seat. Manpanion and I shared the cheeseburger with thick cut bacon, a side of bacon, fries, and the salad.  We also had a bloody (which was eh, nothing to write home about) and an iced coffee.   The Burger was one of the best!  Ooey gooey and delicious- great meat to bread ratio.   The salad was lightly dressed, laced with herbs and just awesome especially with the thick cut bacon which was  a star!  The fries were like the rest of his restaurants (i.e. gilt)  deliciously  crisp and fried in bacon fat.  The service was great and fast.   Overall a wonderful experience and if we can ever get in again we will be back."
"Amazeballs!! I'm pretty much repeating what has already been said, but the food, drinks, service, and ambiance are all just perfect.  The wait is the only issue, but everything else is perfection. The Pegu Club cocktail was a great way to start -- light, refreshing and not too sweet.My friends and I shared a ton of food: double cheeseburger, raw vegetable salad, crispy fries with mornay sauce and egg, and general jane's honey fried chicken. So delicious and hearty, perfect for keeping us warm in the brutally cold winter.  The cheeseburger was easily the best I have had in my life.The Mille Feuille was the perfect ending to our perfect dinner.  I'll definitely be back to try brunch!"
Mind. Blown. That burger is incredible. I will never have a burger as good as the bacon + fried egg + cheeseburger ever again. Life. Made.
"There's no denying that they make a good burger!  I added the egg and bacon and it was DELICIOUS.  They seemed to have a good selection of beers but being 6 months pregnant skipped that and got a side of fries.  They we're really just that...a side of fries.  Nothing really stood out enough to help me grasp what people were so excited about.  *Note: The single burger is two patties.  Also, I definitely recommend stopping outside of prime hours.  I was here after work (5:30 on a Wednesday).  Seating was immediate verses the 2.5 hours quoted when we decided to pass a previous weekend night."
"This place was cool, burger was good, and great music. Hostess took down our number and two hours later after never receiving a call we headed back and asked the hostess how much longer and he looked and said he texted us a while ago. I never received a text and I am positive he took the wrong number. On the bright side, we were seated immediately. My boyfriend and I had a burger Au Cheval style and ordered fries. Fries we nothing special and the burger was good, but not worth $22 IMO. However my BF absolutely loved it. I would recommend checking it out but I'm not sure I would go back."
"They say the good things in life are worth waiting for. Thus, a restaurant with the explosive flavors and chic decor of Au Cheval should be worth waiting a while for. Or in our case, one and a half hours. Granted, it was a Friday evening and the restaurant does not take reservations. That being said, I would totally accept the long wait time for a chance to dine there again. My date and I ventured out to this hip section of West Loop at my date's recommendation. A lot of pressure falls upon the restaurant recommender, especially on a first date. He passed with flying colors, or should I say ""frying"" colors after ordering three delicious items from the menu to share. The first was a side of thick cut peppered bacon which was absolutely phenomenal. The bacon was tender and marinated in a slightly sweet, slightly peppered glaze that oozed perfection. Perfect to share. The second was the General Jane's honey-fried chicken with chile, sesame and cilantro. A spin-off of the traditional Chinese dish, General Tso's chicken, the entrée  was an intense combination of sweet and spicy. The chicken was well cooked and glazed in a sauce that combined notes of honey with the spicy tones of chile peppers. What a kick. The third was the crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy. Quite possibly my favorite. It's breakfast-for-dinner done in a chic, sophisticated manner. The combination of the crispiness of the hash browns with the soft and creamy texture of the duck heart gravy was inspiring. Hopefully you have a history of great cholesterol before you indulge in this entrée...The modern, dark ambiance of the restaurant is both relaxing and invigorating. A great place to dine and spend your weekend. Overall, Au Cheval is now one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in the city of Chicago. The food is fantastic, the ambiance is awesome & the servers are spectacular. Will definitely be dining here again and recommend it to all of my readers!"
"OK so they make a great burger.   Seriously does it have the ability to stand up to a burger from the Snuggery?    I was very surprised but yes it it an amazing burger.   Equal to or maybe a little better than the snug ... Snug cheaper and better Cajun fries.   Au Chivau better date place.   Au wins on atmosphere for a date with amazing burgers, snug for watching the hawks and having an amazing burger."
The bacon is killer!
Best burgers! Bacon and fries were overhyped but the burgers were super. Love the atmosphere and music!
"Amazing food, bot just the burger but the chiliquiles. The service is a little rude but I dont know if its intentional"
"Food: unapologetically rich. This could be good or bad depending on your tastes. I ordered the burger (honestly dear yelpers, I don't think you need an egg or the bacon in it, unless you want to bring yourself closer to a heart attack! It was already so rich in itself.) and the bacon on the side. The bacon I ordered because of yelp recommendations. I wish I didn't. It's bacon. The burger was good but hello, there was a strand of hair in it. Hurray. Not.Service: good at first then terrible towards the end. We waited for the check for so long, I had to STAND UP and actually go to someone at the bar to ASK FOR OUR BILL. This was lunchtime on a Tuesday. I don't care if the restaurant was full. Service should still be good, especially for a place that is known for a 1 to 2 hour wait. Oh, maybe THIS is why there's a 2 hour wait.Summary: good food but not worth the wait or the crappy service. Be sure to go work out before or after your meal."
"Hipster paradise. In all seriousness I love me some brunch and this place was heaven in my mouth.  I've lived in Chicago for just 4 months, and I've managed to go here twice.  I've been advised by friends to space out my next visit. I cannot get over places that serve delicious, tasty, food truly worth every penny. This is the place.  Quality food, drinks and service. Typing about this place makes my mouth water. I recommend at some point sitting at  the bar, so you can see these crafty cooks do their magic.  I think I might have proposed to the frie chick at least 3x, I was just rambling off compliments to her without even a drop of booze. Fair warning there might be a line! I've been lucky enough to not have to wait either time.  Enjoy!"
"Great service, food, and beers on tap, but it comes at a price because the place is small and ended up packed on the Saturday afternoon I came in. Leave the kids at home. Not the place for them. Trendy place. I love Chi-Town!!!"
Everything is great about this place except for the ridiculous wait time for a table. Enough said.
I would give 0 star if I could. I'm not happy with the reception is.  The customer service is really poor that we didn't even want to stay. Maybe your business is great so you don't care at all. Maybe it's just a job so you don't care. But it's not right to treat customer this way.
Wait time is too long. 2 hrs every time you go. Don't know why management can't change procedure .its just ridiculous and unprofessional . Maybe they need us to stand outside for advertisement   They should either take reservations or expand . Waiting for 2 hours is frustrating . This  is not super fancy restaurant where you get awesome food.music is too loud ...
"You will wait an hour or two no matter the night but the fried eggs, burgers, and fries were worth the wait. Especially the fries with aioli. Plus they will text you ten minutes before your table is ready so you can go roam around or get a drink next door. No regrets!"
Fantastic food and beer! Definitely a hipster hangout. Get there early. Burgers and brats are delish!
"Best cheeseburger of my life.  Get the double with bacon and egg and you will walk away a happy man.Also, had the bone marrow.  It was extremely rich, but oh so buttery delicious.When in Chicago, GO!  It was entirely worth the hour wait."
"Dude, one of the most overrated Burgers in Chicago, if not the US. Last time I was in Chicago on business, went to Au Cheval. To sum it up in three words, A HOT MESS. Sloppy, greasy, wet bun Burger with little flavor. Maybe it was an off night, but my experience left little reason to want to go back."
"Entered Au Chavel, very dark but light enough to see people at your table. Good music and tight space so the vibe is active but not too fancy.We ordered the chopped salad w/ HUGE pieces of their famous bacon. Heavy with the ranch, but a decent appetizer to begin the night. Also had two beers, they have a great selection. Had the fries, great garlic aioli, but if you want some ketchup you have to ask :). The waiter warned us not to put the ketchup on the burger, so when we got it (with egg and bacon), the first bite was so juicy and filling. The flavors burst in your mouth, but as you continue eating it... it keeps getting heavier and heavier. And mind you, that we (my fiancee and I) were splitting it. Overall, I probably won't go again because our preference isn't for the burger to be too heavy. But definitely worth checking out and be very hungry before you go! PS - on a Wednesday night we had to wait for an hour (we got there at six)"
"Still one of my favorite high cholesterol places in the city. Come to indulge, but leave beyond satisfied! I finally had the burger after all these years & it definitely lives up to the hype. Get the fries with the fried egg! The brunch menu is different from dinner though. So no luck in getting my favorite chicken for brunch. That means you have to come back for dinner!"
"The burger is truly great and worth the hype. It's just a classic burger, so if that's what you're in the mood for, this is the place to get it. Don't expect anything crazy like from Little Goat or Kuma's. I was personally blown away by how good the bone marrow was; best bone marrow I've had in Chicago."
"For a group of 6 we only waited about 30 min (not too bad), that being said the seating was pretty cramped (3 people cramped into a 2 person booth on both sides). Got the single burger on the hash brown bun with bacon and fried egg. It was bye yummy. Maybe not quite worth the $18 price tag, but  I would definitely recommend for a one time adventure."
"Hands down, best burger of my life.Notes/Tips:  -They don't take reservations and the wait is long, so put your name on the list, go to one of the nearby restaurants for an appetizer and a drink to wait (especially in cold weather).-The french fries are fried in pork fat/grease.-The egg is a must.  Enjoy!"
"I was really and honestly expecting to be underwhelmed with Au Cheval.  When a place is as hyped up as this little joint is, I expect it to fall flat in some aspect.  But, entering Au Cheval is like wandering into a little slice of heaven with good hip-hop on the PA.The host and servers were all bright, professional, and personable and somehow managed to move about the rather cramped space of the dining room without bumping into anything.  And, believe me, that's a feat as the tables are packed in pretty tight in the back.  The interior is dark even with the windows lining the wall, and the overall tone is relaxed and easygoing.My wife and I are on a life-long burger odyssey and Chicago offers a lot of fare.  I'd heard the burger at Au Cheval was best in the city but was skeptical, so we both ordered a single (mine with bacon and egg, hers only bacon).  They arrived with surprising speed and with equal speed were assembled and eaten.  No fries, no frills, get in there and crush it.And, I have to say, the proponents were right.  The Au Cheval single was one of the most decadent, savory, and amazing things I've ever eaten.  The bacon was thick as a plank and perfectly cured, the egg was absolutely pristine, and somehow the non-pretzel bun held up to it all.  It was an astoundingly good burger that definitely warrants another trip.Visit time: 5:00pm on a Thursday.  Seated immediately and had a beer in my hand in five minutes with no lags in service at all."
"Almost impossible to get in during prime hours, but once you do, this place is something special. Best burger I've had outside of NYC and it still may even top that!"
"We had a late night venture here and I absolutely love the atmosphere of this place! They had the best has browns I have ever tasted! They were cooked perfectly! The ice cream flavors were ok, maybe it was because I could not stop thinking about the hash browns! My friend ordered the pastrami sandwich and it was good, just not my style."
"Here's the thing.  The burgers here are delicious.  Total hangover burger, but I'm not sure if they're worth the price, let alone the wait.  Oh believe me, I'm no stranger to waiting.  Hell, when the hostess said ""an hour to an hour and fifteen"" I ignored the shaking of the head followed by the ""no"" from behind me and put my name on the list ""just in case"".  I figured we'd walk down to Porkchop and see what their quoted time was.No need.  The hostess was awesome and ended up saying to wait a minute, inquired about a table and had us seated right away.  Sure, it was right by the kitchen and small, but it was better than waiting an hour+ for a table 2ft away.  The food was good.  Their burgers are confusing.  A double is 3 patties, which means a single must be 2.  If you order bacon on it, count on thinking you're now eating 4 patties.  No joke.  No wonder a side of bacon is $9, shit is huge!  The fries were average, although that garlic aioli was great.  My favorite were the smashed potatoes and gravy.  I rarely order mashed potatoes, but do yourself a favor and get an order of these.The burgers were greasy.  I was happy, since I was still nursing a hangover (despite it being 7pm), but for the price I felt I could go to a greasy spoon diner and get it for 3/4 of the cost with the same taste!  Assuming you know the right diner....The staff was friendly, and surprisingly attentive.  The decor was cool.  Reminded me of Scofflaw without the pretentious cocktails.  The beer list is adequate, if you're still newish to craft beer.  I'd go again, but I definitely would not wait more than 15 mins."
"As usual with places like this, I was expecting it to be more overrated than Paul Walkers death. But I enjoyed it. However I don't think I'd wait the hour and a half we almost did. There were only two of us, so we were actually seated right away at a small table in a cramped area. Not very comfortable.To sum it up quickly: really good food, but too small and crowded. If you aren't sure what to expect like me, think dimly lit bistro meets greasy spoon diner. The setup, and in some areas the food of a diner, but more much more elegant. They were bumping 90's rap music, so that's where the amorous ambiance ends. The menu ranges from standard fare to slightly unique. I ordered the double burger (here double means triple, regular means double. Don't ask me) with bacon. The bacon itself was nearly as thick as one hamburger patty. The burger was hella good, albeit very greasy. I tried both the fries (comes with an awesome dipping sauce) and mashed potatoes. Both were excellent. Things are a bit pricey, but at least you won't leave still hungry. If you're in the mood to try something a little quirky but good, add this to your list."
"If hype is your thing, and airhead hostesses are your turn-ons then by all means wait the three hours! We did for nothing. Talking to an idiot at the front door 3-4 times who seemed to forget what was going on and that she was working (and her sidekicks were the same little sort of dummies) is  cool if you are a chaser chasing down the best new burger which in the end since other friends were seated was - you know - a freaking burger. We were glad to have great beer and wonderful cocktails next door. That place is awesome. For me, Certainly I will try this place when I can do more than wait 3 hours and not have to waste time chatting with morons. Until then, I will go other places who make basically the same food. Same as the other guys and same as those other guys. That's the menu. This is what cracks me up. Chasing the ""hype"" you forget that there are some wonderful places doing 98% the same thing. After all that wait for nothing and having our friends report back that their experience was ""just like all the other BUZZ places."" How original.  This is not NYC. Who cares if your buddy was on some dumb chef show? Really? Why wait? Why bother? One must stop and ask what exactly is being prepared, and ""put an egg on it"" is about as mundane these days as ""put a bird on it"" was 2 years ago. Chase on, chase on. I won't bother."
"Nice experience here.  I showed up for a table at 6pm on a Monday.... and it was packed!  They don't take reservations and I was honestly astonished by the amount of people already waiting so early on such a random day.  No seats at the bar, no tables.  Having said that, the host told me it would be a 45 minute wait, we walked over to another bar, and he texted 5 minutes later saying our table was ready.  Seems they exaggerate the wait for some reason, as others have noted this.The cocktail menu was a bit limited but they had a nice selection of beers, even some affordable options, like a tall can of PBR.  Whiskey shots are on sale every day, so we promptly had those!I was looking forward to the burger as I'd been told by many people it was the best in Chicago.  It was delicious after all; perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the bacon was excellent.  The fries and garlic aoli were also yummy.I have to say that I may have agreed with the other reviewers and said it was the best... it's better than Kuma's, at least, but I had just been to the new Umami Burger in Wicker Park a few days before, and I'm sorry, Umami won this fight.Still, it was a delicious meal and they had a lot of intriguing items on the menu, so I'll definitely be back!"
"The Fulton Market Area ended up being my dinner spot for the past few nights. Every night ended with a food bang and this night was no less. Au Cheval was not on our radar at first, but was recommended by our bartender at The Office. She does not crave for burgers, but she craves this one. I had to set out and investigate this matter.Au Cheval was a lot more popular than previously thought. It was the feeling that everyone who was hip was here. Interior looks like this place was formerly a 50's style diner with bar stools and booths. With a 1.5 hour wait on a Saturday night, we investigated into first come bar stools and lo and behold, there are 5 unassigned but highly contended seats. A couple others already knew this and were hovering as we were. With the luck of the Irish, we scored 2 after about 30 minutes.-=-Burger, Foie Gras Added-=- So it seems my Chicago trip can also be labeled as a foie gras extravaganza. The California ban forces me into this situation of splurging purging then splurging, and this night the crowning jewel would be this burger with a foie gras spread. It was 9 dollars extra charge which was probably good for the shock factor, but I could see better ways to get my foie/dollar. Regardless, this burger was heavenly. Highlights go to the flavorful beef patty which was medium rare and extra juicy. I could say it's comparable to the best burgers in Los Angeles, the self proclaimed ""undisputed burger capital of the world."" Sodas were all canned. A bit of a letdown, but I do believe that they'd rather you try the beers."
"We headed over to Au Cheval after enjoying a can of Yoho Wednesday Cat at Lone Wolf next door. After you get over its ""we will survive with or without you so it's your call whether you want to wait an hour or not"" greeting (welcome to the new cooler than River North West Loop, get over it) and cramped quarters, Au Cheval proved to be worth the queue. Drinks hit the spot, the raw veggie salad was refreshing, the fries and aioli addictive, and the""single"" burger is a really a double patty...and the ""double"" is a triple decker. Add egg and bacon and you have yourself a $16 masterpiece. God Bless America and its French-named burger joints. The West Loop, Randolph St and Hogsalt continue to impress."
"It was Thursday night closing in on 10pm and everything was shutting down in downtown, I guess it's a mid west thing.  Luckily, we decided to cab it over to Au Cheval and a cranky hungry couple had our frowns instantly turned upside down.  Firstly, it's open till 1am which helps people like me who can never decide what to eat before everything closes.  However be prepared to wait, they told us it was an hour wait but that was a bit of an exaggeration, we were seated a lot sooner.  The staff is all extremely friendly, the people working the host, waitress, bartender, and waiter were extremely friendly and helpful, major points for that.Now onto the food.  I got the cheeseburger with a fried egg and it was juicy, rich,  and sumptuous.  Believe the hype, highly recommended.  We also got General Jane's Fried Chicken which was extremely good also.  However these are more like chicken wings than fried chicken.  We didn't get any breast or thigh pieces.  Still though, really good flavor... kinda reminded me of Korean Fried Chicken.  I really wish I was in Chicago more to explore the menu further."
The hashbrown burger is a gift to the world.
"Most of chicago's hot spots are a once in a while affair; however, for some reason, this place remains a regular go to. The food is most definitely on the heavier side (foie gras eggs, bone marrow, fried bologna sandwich, etc.), but that doesn't mean it's not delicious! Because it is. The cocktails and beer are on point too, classical, local, and obscure selections to suit any taste. One of the best bloodies in the city. And the burgers are second to none."
"Outstanding restaurant. Service was great - although as everyone else notes, be sure to get your reservation in early (and like us, go have a drink upstairs at Maude's just a block away while you're waiting) and be prepared to wait a bit. I had the cheeseburger with a fried egg on tap, and date had the ham & cheese fondue sandwich - both were absolutely delicious and incredibly rich - alongside an order of fries. Probably the best meal I ate while in Chicago for the holidays.Overall with a few drinks (very good drink menu as well) each and food, the bill was very reasonable for such great quality. Absolutely will be back again!"
"Any words I write in this review are inadequate compared to the decadent and delicious food here.   To keep it simple, the best burger and fried chicken I have ever had in my life.  Absolutely outstanding.  It's worth all the time in the world to come here for dinner.  If you hate waiting, then come at an obscure time, do what ever you can to get this food in your life."
"Had lunch at this place last Thursday for my birthday and was quite impressed.A very busy place at 1:30 for lunch, but we were cordially greeted, seated at the only table open and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, from the beverages to the food and the dessert and waiters singing happy BD.  Great cheeseburger and great smashed potatoes!"
"A long wait but worth it.  The burger was really great as was the fries with egg, aollie, and cheese, plus the pickle. But I do think Kumas is just a little better..."
"Pretty good without being TOO expensive considering it's in the west loop.Here's my standard breakdown, enjoy.Food:You can tell the menu has been prepared by some gal or guy who has been slaving in the food service industry for 20 years because it's really pretty tasty.  The burgers are good and all their fancy shit like confit is masterfully seasoned and textured.Drink:The beer is beer.  Every damn bar has a craft beer selection these days, so its beer selection is par with the 800 other hip bars in Chicago.  The cocktails are pretty good, not the best I've ever had, but  ""7/10 would put in my face again"".Ambiance:Standard ""I'm upper middle class and live in the West Loop"" decor and crowd.  I.e. expensive cherry wood laid against fancypants brick.  Crowd == business casual folk talking about investment portfolios.So after I left, I didn't turn to my date and say ""OH DAMN BABY, I'M READY FOR YOU NOW"", but I did say ""so that was better than average eh?"" and she said ""yeah, that's right""."
"Unassuming and out of the way this place makes the ordinary extraordinary. Great beers on tap, stellar menu, inviting and competent staff, boisterous incidental music playing on reel to reel, and a sexy open kitchen makes this joint one of the best casual restaurants in Chicago if not in the states in general. Come early or late... Not a well kept secret."
Best burger. Hands down!
"So, I'm a little on the fence here. We knew this place was popular. It was a Friday. We came at lunch and the wait was over an hour. Then, when we finally got seated, it was another 15-20 minutes or so for our burgers. Don't get me wrong -the burgers are pretty good. Everyone was super friendly and accommodating. So, I get why this place is popular. It has a really cool, kind of ""rock star"" vibe. There was music playing, and a lot of local (meaning downtown workers) off already having a beer (lucky bastards). If you go -I would definitely try to go at an off time due to the wait. The irony is that when we left around 1:30pm or so, there was no line. So our idea to get there early was an epic fail. Go for a late lunch and you will not wait and will not be disappointed by the food.I would definitely come back during a less busy time and then update my review accordingly. I just wish the wait wasn't so excruciatingly long, as we try to keep our lunch to an hour. Otherwise, the service, vibe and food were really good!"
"We had a fabulous meal at Au Cheval, and have every time we've been there. Tonight was something special though - a birthday celebration for someone very dear to us; and we finally had that 32-oz pork porterhouse. It was out of this world! (You have to reserve this ahead of time - they only make one per day Mon-Thur and two per day on the weekend, if I remember correctly). Also had the roasted bone marrow, which is delicious. It was a great meal and a wonderful evening all the way around.  Many thanks to Erika for help in setting up our celebration for our family member (and for the wonderful dessert surprise at the end of the meal). We had a great time!"
"I loved the food here, party of four plus a kid and we all were very happy.It is not so kid friendly, but that might make this place a six star venture for some.  Note there are no high chairs or booster seats and only one or two foods that little kids can eat solo (fries and mashed potatoes).  However all staff were more than accommodating and nice to the kid in our party so I was very satisfied despite a tyke crawling all over us.Salad with ranch, egg, and bacon was delightful.  Delicious non-alcoholic drinks, I especially enjoyed $2 home made lemonade.  Loved the burgers, pickles, fries, garlic aioli.  Adored the mashed potatoes.  It was a quick dinner and the staff was really great."
"I went for brunch and shared a bunch of food with two of my friends. Everything was amazing. The ambiance was busy but not snobby in any way.Spinach, blue cheese, and caramelized onion omelette - this was the softest fluffiest omelette I have ever had. The combo of the blue cheese and caramelized onions was great.Crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy - the potatoes were perfectly cooked and you clearly cannot go wrong with gravy. Foie gras and scrambled eggs - although I definitely enjoyed this dish, I felt that the caramelized onions overpowered the foie gras.Thick-cut peppered bacon - to die for. Best bacon I've had in my life.Fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli, and fried farmed egg - delicious, and the two sauces work well together.Great experience. I would definitely come back the next time I'm in Chicago."
"I have lost count of how many times these guys have had me return. This upscale diner is just amazing on every level.They definitely have the best burger I have ever had in Chicago. I will defend this opinion with absolute servility. You must get it with the egg and bacon; you will not be disappointed. The bologna sandwich is equally as great (savory tho a bit on the salty side but absolutely delicious), I almost always take one to go. Really you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.No Reservations + Amazing Food = Large Crowds & Purgatory Wait Times. It would be best for you get there early and/or be prepared to wait. Though you can get seated pretty quickly during lunch hours and if you head on over around 10pm during the work week.With regards to service, you'll be well taken care of. I would ask to be seated in Erin's section if possible, even if that means waiting longer. I absolutely love her!"
"After a cold but victorious outdoor Blackhawks Stadium Series game over Pittsburgh last night we needed a bite to eat. Au Cheval seemed like the right fit having never been and boasting a menu with some tempting dishes and drinks. We made it there just before midnight on Saturday and the wait was short, bonus.We shared the bone marrow with beef cheek marmalade, foie gra scrambled eggs and toast, and the double cheeseburger. The marrow was our favorite, it was tasty and the accompanied beef cheek marmalade had a nicely balanced sweetness. The foie eggs were rich but went so well together I imagined how gluttonous this combo could make my Sunday breakfast. The burger was good all around but not necessarily a contender among Chicago burger offerings. We also had the Strange Brew which had an interesting seesaw between the pineapple juice and IPA, the Bloody Mary that was just alright and unfortunately came with sweet pickle slices rather than sour, and a nice and hoppy IPA of which the name escapes me.Overall the experience was great. The dishes while not cheap were satisfying due to quality and portion, especially the foie scrambled eggs. The staff was helpful, courteous, and prompt. It was a tad dim making it a little difficult to see the menu as well as the darker components of the meal, a shame because you should be able to read a menu without using their candles and actually see what you are eating. Great food, so why hide it?"
Delicious. Great place for breakfast & lunch. Good service.Be prepared for a bit of a wait.
Incredible atmosphere and great wait staff.  Three words sum it up; BEST BURGER EVER.  Worth the standard 2-hour wait time.
"Service is great, as is the space (especially the open kitchen seats). The thick-cut bacon is fantastic, but the signature cheeseburgers were a little disappointing. Everyone raves, but they're really simple. While the prep and cooking of what's there is fantastic, the flavors are not super complex or adventurous (or sustainably interesting). That said, still easily a 4+ star experience."
"Best burger in the city. Went at lunch, was told it would be a half hour wait but we were seated within 10 minutes. It's loud and small inside. Service was not great. Had to flag down the waiter to place our order and also to get the check. Other servers tried to help but it caused confusion. For example, after giving our credit card to our server to pay, another server gave us another table's check. The burger is worth it though."
One of the best places in chicago to grab a burger.  The place is small and you have to wait awhile to be seated but it's totally worth it. The bar is basically in the kitchen so you see all the hard and delicious work being freshly made. I had the single cheeseburger it's big and has two patties so don't get the double cause it's bigger lol. And this place also closes at 1am if you need to sober up with a delicious burger
"Au Cheval is now my go-to traditional burger place. I went there alone on a cold Thursday night. Got seated at the bar instantly, so that was nice. Got a simple single (which came with double patties) cheeseburger with an egg on top ($10 + $2 for the egg). At first, I was surprised at how cheap it was for a gourmet burger, but keep in mind that a burger here doesn't come with fries which is like $6 extra. The beer list was reasonably priced and interesting. My waiter was fine, but I wasn't looking for attentive service when I was just sitting at the bar eating, drinking, and reading. I sat next to the manager's area. not really sure what he does, but he seemed to be in charged. He wipes plates and makes sure the presentation is good before giving the plates to the waiters. The manager was very cold and blunt when I asked him questions about the food that's coming out which gave me a very negative impression of their usual service. My cheeseburger was pretty damn good. It's simply just a basic cheeseburger done well. I think comparing Au Chevel to places like Three Aces/Owen and Engine isn't fair since their burger are so different. I think they use frozen processed burger patties.... which is surprising given how good the burger tasted. I also got the gelato for desserts because their other dessert option is like $12 and huge for one person. The peppermint was light and refreshing but the vanilla was way too sweet. My total bill came out to be $30 something for a burger, a beer, and 2 scoops of gelato.I think my favorite part of Au Cheval besides the cheeseburger was the ambiance. I felt like I was in the meatpacker's district; something too ""cool"" for Chicago. It was warm yet hip; a great date place."
"The Burgers are AMAZING . The flavor was all there and the toppings were not so over bearing like some other burger joints. You can add an egg or bacon or just have it as is. The fries are also delicious , and they give you a side of a garlic aoli type dip. The ambiance is intimate and they play VERY good music (hip hop) so overall it was relaxed. You can go straight to the bar if you don't want to wait for a table otherwise wait times average at about an hour/hour and a half. Good thing is there are plenty of nearby places to go to if you decide to wait. Overall had a great experience here and parking wasn't as bad as I thought it would be."
"I knew I would have to wait on a Saturday. Three hours was a bit much. We got the roasted bone marrow and beef cheek marmalade for an app and this was beyond delicious and so full of flavor. We all got the burger for dinner. While it was good, it was not the amazing to-die-for experience I was prepared to have. Worth trying but not the best of the best."
GO!! JUST GO!!My favorite brunch spotGet the single or double Burger!!!The burgers here are amazing. Melt-in-your-damn-mouth amazing. Best hours is right before they open at brunch around 10ish. If you decided to go after be prepared to wait 2 hours !!!!!!! it's worth waiting !!!!One more thing coffee there is beyond amazing!
"Two servers refused to take drink orders, bartender gave us cold shoulder.  Bologna sandwich, fries and even salad were wayyy to salty.  Burger was good but overshadowed by saltiness of other food.  Was expecting a flawless experience due to almost all 4 and 5 star reviews."
"Damn, this is a good burger!  Worth the wait...on off peak times...hah.  We waited close to an hour, but were able to go to a bar close by and have them call us when they had a table ready.  Not too bad on a nice summer night.  This burger can get pricey quick with all of the add-ons, but you seriously can NOT not get bacon...that would be a sin.  It's SO good!!  Normally, I would give 4 stars because of price and wait, but the service was above and beyond.  I was in my first trimester when I ate here and totally forgot to ask for my burger to be well done (as I like medium rare) and when it came, I saw that it was kinda pink even though it's pretty dark in there. I explained to our waitress my ordeal and told her since I forgot that it's OK to take it back and cook it longer....but noooo, that would ruin everything so she gave me a brand new burger with no fuss or attitude.  Super thumbs up!!  I'm sure one of the staff enjoyed my delicious mistake anyway...so its a win win and a 5 start from me!!"
"Everyone in Chicago has a place they claim has the best burger. While I can't say I've been to them all, I've been to a lot. Au Cheval has the best burger in Chicago.First off be prepared to wait. However, like most reviews on here they will overestimate your wait. We got there at 6:30pm on a Friday night and they told us 2.5-3 hours. But if you know going in you're going to have to wait it's OK. They will take your phone number and you can go over to The Lone Wolf or Haymarket and have a beer. The Lone Wolf is the only place in Chicago that I know of that has Zombie Dust on tap. After about 2 hours we went back to the restaurant to see our status. The hostess told us she was about to text us, and we got seated right then. Wait was only 2 hours and it wasn't bad. We got to sit at the counter which is cool if you have a party of 2.Get the burger. I'm getting sick of this specialty burgers with 100s of toppings and 18 types of buns and different meats. A single is a double and a double is a triple. They won't ask you how you want your burger cooked or what kind of cheese you want. They will ask if you want a fried egg or bacon. For the love of God get bacon. It's not a strip of overcooked breakfast bacon. It's 2 thick cut strips of the most amazing peppered bacon ever. It's an extra $3.5 or something like that but well worth it. The burger is pretty cheap itself.The fries are also amazing. We didn't get the fried egg fries, just the standard fries with garlic aioli. The burger was perfectly cooked and the bacon added another element that was incredible. I've been to Kuma's and this place beats Kuma's easily.Bottom line: It's worth the wait. It's not expensive. It's the best burger in Chicago period."
"Came here when visiting Chicago with friends. Had to get the burger- though nothing else on the menu really appealed to me anyway. The single burger comes with 2 patties, cheese, aioli, and your choice of fried egg or bacon as add-ons. I got mine without the egg or bacon and it was really good. Not the best burger I've ever had, and I wish they had told me about the aioli since I would have asked for it without, but overall pretty good. Not quite worth all the hype, but would recommend."
"Nothing like coming off a night shift and getting a burger at Au Cheval. Good food, good music, and drinking at the Lone Wolf afterward.  Au Cheval makes a homemade bologna that's pretty awesome, don't be scared!"
I will keep this simple. You must go here. The best burger you have ever had is waiting for you. Enough said.
"I know, I know - I'm probably one of the last Chicagoans to dine at Au Cheval, but I finally made it over. With that being said, the food is absolutely incredible and is totally worth all the hype!My group of friends and I made our way over to Au Cheval around 5ish because we've heard horror stories about how long the wait can be. Luckily for us, we beat the rush and were able to snag a comfy booth next to the entrance. The atmosphere is warm, vibrant and lively. They even have their own playlist of music that plays on this funky-vintage-mechanical apparatus. The concept of Au Cheval is pretty much a French twist on class American diner fare.  The name 'Au cheval' in French means 'on horseback,' but in culinary terms it means 'egg on top.' Everything on the menu looked great so it was a challenge to decide, but we ended up ordering:CRISPY FRIES + MORNAY +GARLIC AIOLI + FRIED EGGAnything with a fried egg on top is a no-brainer. The fries were crispy on the outside and creamy inside plus they are fried in beef fat! How can you go wrong with that!? The sauces were just as amazing. The mornay was thick and creamy while the aioli was smooth and tangy. Perfect pairings for the fries!HAM & CHEESE FONDUE + FRIED EGGThis dish was just as impressive with its ooey gooey buttery cheesy goodness along with generous slivers of ham all broiled until golden brown. As if that wasn't enough, it's topped with yet another fried egg (see the theme?) The dish is served with several slices of buttery brioche Texas toast as a vehicle to eat the fondue. The bread was so good we asked for more!DOUBLE CHEESEBURGER + FRIED EGGNote: a single burger is two patties and a double is three - odd I know, but whatevs. I knew I had to try this out after discovering that Bon Appetit (yes, you read that right) named Au Cheval's burger as the best in the country. I know dem some fighting words, but it was everything I expected and more - the patties are thin, but they're cooked and seasoned perfectly with the crispy bits of the exterior while the inside was moist. The rich and buttery brioche bun complemented the burger well. It's served with  homemade pickles, red onion and dijonnaise. I also added a fried egg = no-brainer, duh (only $1 more, YOLO).FRIED BOLOGNA SANDWICH:This B-O-L-O-G-N-A ain't the stuff you saw on those Oscar Mayer commercials. My friend ordered this and from what I tasted, it was frekin' delicious. The sandwich is stacked high with homemade bologna and oozing cheese that they need to be secured with skewers. Definitely remembered flavors, but so much better than I remember!MILLE FEUILLE Although we were in dire need of doggy bags and a bed, we opted for dessert! Our server Kaycie described the mille feuille as eating a cloud - she had us at cloud. It was stacked high with luscious vanilla cream sandwiched between layers of puff pastry. And to our surprise, our server took the knife and chopped it in half with one fell swoop, which was quite the spectacle. Needless to say, it was delicious and we did everything, but lick the plate. Great way to end such a heavy but satisfying meal.Every part of our experience was phenomenal. Service was spot on from our server to the bussers - Kaycie did a great job offering suggestions, answer questions and checking on us despite the hoards of people. Our glasses were always filled and plates were cleared in a timely fashion. She even let us split the bill a billion ways, which we appreciated. Parking in this area can be hit or miss so just drive around in circles and you're bound to find a spot. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend trying it out it for yourself! I know I'll definitely be back soon!"
"Interesting food, great drinks and great atmosphere. The reel to reel tape machine for the music is a nice touch. The menu is always changing, and the food is not for someone on a diet, to say the least. Its upscale comfort food, which is usually not my thing but Au Cheval does such a great job with it.Order the Bloody Mary. Best I've ever had. My friend who hates bloody marys even had to agree that this one was good."
"Don't believe the hype! The burger was good, but not worth the long wait. The place is too small and they don't have an adequate space for those waiting to be seated."
"I came on a Saturday night around 630pm and I was surprised to only find a 5 minute wait for a group of 4. The largest party they can sit is 6, so they split our party of 8 into two. I ordered the crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy and it was delicious. Never had anything quite like it before and the gravy certainly made this dish special.I also tried some of the chicken wings, which had ginseng on it, giving it an Asian spin to it. The size of the wings were huge and all my friends who ordered seemed to have trouble finishing it.Our server convinced us to order a dessert that was suppose to taste like a cloud, but ended up being kind of flaky/crunchy. For some reason, our server had the brilliant idea of chopping the dessert into two with a knife, which caused the top of our dessert to land onto the table. She didn't even bother to apologize and just said ""oops"". 4 star food quality2 stars for poor service"
"I've heard so much about the burgers at Au Cheval. After months of putting it off, I finally got myself here and experienced it. We came in around 6pm on Thursday; I barely got a sip of the beer I ordered at the bar before we were seated at a table. I was impressed by their use of space and how quickly we got a table, but I will say that the tables were a liiiittle too close to each other. The server kept bumping into my chair and a few times when he would lean in to give the table next to us food, his butt would bump into my arm :/I don't know how math works here, but the single burger comes with two juicy patties, while the double comes with three. The burgers are topped with delicious, thinly sliced pickles and a dijon mayonnaise. They're served with a pickle spear and stabbed through the middle with a steak knife. I recommend getting a side of fries to share; it's a big portion. That is served with a garlic aioli, which was too garlicky for my dining companion, but perfect to me (though it did require an extra mint post dinner).I will definitely return and will do my best to try the other items on the menu, though I can also see myself just getting a burger each time I'm here."
"Lives up to they hype, worth the wait."
"4.5 stars, need to revisit before giving it 5. Came here on a weeknight with a friend around 10pm, seated immediately.Single cheeseburger w/bacon and egg ($9.95, bacon +$3.50, egg +$1. Total $14.45) - 4.5 stars. One of the best burgers I've ever had. Comes with a pickle. No fries. I'll have to try it again before giving it 5 stars.. General Jane's honey-fried chicken ($17.95) - 4.25 stars. Sweet & sticky ginger marinade. Reminds me of Korean chicken wings, gampoongi.Fries w/aioli ($5.95) - 4 stars. Crispy, delicious, well-salted, but pricey.I will return.. !"
"Their burger with bacon and egg is my favorite in Chicago. So perfectly balanced, creamy, and.. pretty. The bone marrow is a pretty generous portion. It's definitely large enough for more than 2 people to share. The fries with garlic aioli is really yummy, too. The second time I stopped by, they were out of the matzoh ball soup.. bummer. On a weekday night around 5:30pm, there was a 20 minute wait for a table for 2. On a Sunday at 10pm, there was no wait to sit at the bar. I will definitely be back for their burger and also to try the matzoh ball soup."
"Let me start off by saying that THE WAIT IS WORTH IT. Au Cheval is amazing. The dishes are so different and some even sound intimidating when read on the menu, but don't be! Don't leave Au Cheval without trying- roasted marrow bones, beef cheek marmalade and toast- foie gras, scrambled eggs and toast (SO GOOD)- and the cheeseburger, of course!Service is pretty great too. I'd go here every week, if I could!"
"Simply put, Au Cheval cheese burger with egg and bacon was the best burger I've ever eaten. You've got to be in the right mood for it though as it is quite rich. I went with a friend for her birthday and we split that alongside the crispy chicken and a side of fries. The burger and the fries could have been enough to split on their own.I'm not generally a fan of asian ginger sauces, but the fried chicken at Au Cheval blew my mind. Perfectly crisp, so flavourful and a hefty portion. The fries were awesome too... can't go wrong with fries in duck fat."
"When you got it, you got it, and Au Cheval's still got it.  Took probably my 10th or 12th person here for their first time a few weeks ago, and I've yet to have anyone not love it. I've recently gotten into ordering the raw vegetable salad, it's the perfect way to start if you ask me!"
"This place is ok but not great... The butter and bread pickles are oddly sweet in flavor. The chili con carne with corn chips was tasty and flavorful. The waitress was nice but oddly enough when the bus boy came to retrieve our plates he gave me a weird attitude when I asked him for a to go container. Hey If i have left overs, you bet I'm taking them home! My experiences here was a weird one. I probably wont be back..."
"I'm a big burger fan.. and once i heard about the burger here and saw the pics on yelp.. i knew i would have to come and give it a try!i ordered the double cheeseburger with fried egg.. i thought it was average only.. maybe because i didn't get the thick cut bacon? but judging by the patties, in my opinion it is lacking flavor..also tried the crispy fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli and fried farm egg.. the fries is decent but its the sauce that made it good..i give this place a 2 1/2 stars.. i will be back to give the burger another shot except this time with the bacon.. hopefully it will change my mind about this place and give it a higher rating.."
"Everyone freaks out about the burger (which is delicious), but try the bologne sandwich.  Sounds gross and feels like you're reliving your unhealthy elementary school years, but it will vastly surpass your expectations.  Juicy and full of flavor!  Also get there at 10:30am for brunch (which opens at 11) and you should get seated in the first round."
AAAAMAZING! Service was amazing from the time you walk in until you leave. When I walked in was asked for my cell number so they can call me when my table is ready. You don't have to stand around and just wait. The burger was perfect and so was the cheese ham dish we ordered. I would highly recommend this place.
"Well first things first, I walked in and it smelled AWESOME. I did so to leave my name because I knew the wait would be long. The host was very nice both when I gave my info and when I came back with my brother and Mom. We all had the single (which is really two patties, I love their logic!) cheeseburger and the fries with mornay sauce and garlic aoli topped with a fried egg... Everything delicious. Our waiter was a redhead whose name I didn't catch. He was great AND knew the correct pronunciations of weird stuff like Weihenstephan! The musical play list was on point as well,  if a bit loud. They could stand to lower it a bit. Honestly though,  a minor quibble for a great establishment. I'm definitely coming back but during dinner hours so I can try the smashed potatoes that my brother and a chatty regular at the bar both assured me are heavenly."
"Chicago can very easily lay claim to being the best burger city in the world. Being from the south side, Top Notch Beefburgers has always been held up as the gold standard. Now it has company. Au Cheval's burgers are phenomenal. So good, in fact, that they do not require, let alone put it out on the table, ketchup or mustard. The cheddar cheese is perfectly gooey and and adds a nice bite to the burger. The buns are not too thick yet are big enough to hold everything inside. And finally, it comes dressed with pickles because every sandwich is better with pickles. Simply, Au Cheval makes perfect burgers.The ambiance is great. The place is set up like a classic diner with a counter and very few tables. You can watch them prepare your food from behind the counter. Music is always played at a perfect level, not too loud and not too quiet. I wanted to know who made the playlist, it felt like every ten minutes the genre would change, classic rock, rap, reggae, they played it all. Service was pretty good, I feel they could have come and offered us drinks a bit quicker, however, I did not mind because the drink list was so expansive that we needed the time to look it all over. Fantastic craft brews from all over the country and three dollar tall boys for those of us who wanted to save some money. Not my best written review, but trust me, if you go here you will not be dissapointed. Wonderful place."
"We were early for our reservation at the Girl and the Goat, so we decided to stop by Au Cheval for a couple of drinks.  I tried out two of the hard ciders, both of which I enjoyed.  I was surprised that one of the ciders was listed as being from Long Grove, IL.  I like in Long Grove and had never heard of it.We sat at the bar which allowed us to watch the chefs at work.  This made my tummy grumble and now I have to return to try some of their dishes!"
"Have been here twice now, and it lives up to the extremely high expectations I had set for the people I brought with me. Which is not an easy accomplishment when you tell them ""it is the Best Cheeseburger in the city."" But it is and I know I will be back. There is always going to be a wait for dinner so learn to live with it and not let it take away from the food experience.What to Order:Single Cheeseburger with Bacon and EggCrispy Fries with Mornay Sauce and Egg(and 2x pickle back shots for good measure)"
"I love burgers so upon arriving in Chicago had to make the trek by foot to try what I read to be the ""best burger in Chicago"" and I must say that my visit was worth every step. The place was packed and there was a wait for tables. Everyone there went out of their way to accommodate getting me the first available seat at the bar. The drink and beer selection was outstanding. The service was fantastic. The entire staff was extremely friendly and worked as a team to deliver a top notch experience. The burger was incredible- everything it was cracked up to be. I really enjoyed my experience at Au Cheval and would love to return to try their other great menu options. I highly recommend this place."
"Came here last night. It was crowded, but managed to snag a stool at the bar. Was worried this would mean I'd get ignored by the wait staff, but someone came by as soon as I got my coat off. Ordered the burger and fries. The burger was a solid effort for 10 bucks. A double patty with cheese, pickles, and onions, cooked to medium rare and on a toasted bun. The meat was tasty and juicy, and with a pickle spear, was a nice cap to a long day.The fries were tasty and mealy, with a dash of salt and a side of garlic aioli. Very tasty, despite the knowledge of dipping your fries in egg yolks and olive oil. A bit on the pricey side, but the service was excellent and a wide selection of beers on tap. Gotta come back for the fried bologna!"
"We came as a party of 5 and waited about 45 minutes per table.  We were seated at a booth and ordered the following: General Jane's Honey-Fried Chicken with Chili, Sesame Seeds, and Cilantro; Crispy Fries with Mornay sauce, garlic aioli, and fried farm egg;   bratwurst plate, 2 Double Cheeseburgers; a side of thick cut peppered bacon; and a Griddled Bratwurst with smashed potatoes and roasted garlic gravy. The sesame chicken was pretty tasty as it came out hot and crispy, and the sweet sauce complemented the dish well.  I wasn't a fan of the bratwurst, but the mashed potatoes that it was nestled in was good.  I was a fan of the crispy fries as the garlic aioli dipping sauce made it amazing with its creamy/garlic-y-ness.  I really enjoyed the bacon as it was a thick-cut and it was quite tasty.  The burgers were good and they were juicy.   The restaurant itself was very dim-litted and the idea of a 'gourmet diner' was quite interesting.  A great experience!+mashed potatoes+crispy fries with garlic aioli dipping sauce+thick-cut bacon+juicy burgers"
"I have been looking forward to eating at Au Cheval for a very long time, the long wait times have been my nemesis. As I am waiting to be seated (for 30mins) I scan the menu to look for their burgers and wings. Once seated I was informed they don't substitute the burger patty for turkey (which I was willing to forgo) but they were out of bacon! It was only 7.30pm and they opened for dinner 2 hours ago. The long waited burger comes and I have to say I was kind of disappointed. With all the amazing reviews and horrendous wait times to eat here I was hoping for an extra ordinary delicious burger and yet this was just a regular burger, a 5/10. Disappointed? Yes, will I go there again? May be just for a drink or try other things on their menu #chicagofoodhop #aucheval"
"Imagine a restaurant where everything you eat competes with the best you've ever had.The hamburgers, fries, mayo, egg, bacon were all amazing.The pickle was amazing too. The EFFING PICKLE WAS AMAZING.I'm not sure how I can go back to normal people food after this. I may either move to Chicago or die of starvation."
"This is hands down the best burger restaurant in Chicago. The food is delicious! However, wait times can be 3.5hrs or more on weekends. When they finally text you, your table isn't ready and they expect you to wait in a small cramped space next to other diners. I once had the misfortune of sitting in one of those booths in the waiting area where service lacked and another customer kept farting as they waited for their seat. The workers can be curt as they run around from the bar to the tables. When I was seated I was in the process of taking my jacket off and the server bumped into me while she squeezed by instead of waiting. Aside from all of that, I still dine here because the food is amazing!"
"A trendy spot for craft beer and comfort eats.  Go early and get on their wait list.  Seating is for right around 50 so it can take some time for your table to be open.  Don't worry, it is well worth the wait.  Go once and you will find a reason to come back!"
"My wife and I have been here twice and we've ordered the same thing both times.  We've been meaning to try their other dishes but the burger and foie gras, scrambled eggs, and toast are just so amazing!One of the best burgers in Chicago!  If you order the burger make sure to get a fried egg on top.  They have an option to add bacon if you're into that.  The foie gras, scrambled eggs, and toast is very rich, buttery, and smooth.  A must try."
Great atmosphere -- the reel to reel tape for hip hop sets the tone.Usually very crowded.I've had the burger twice.  Both times mine was too salty and slightly more done than I had hoped.  Next time going to get the double and also request slightly less salt. Great flavors. Still not convinced it's the best burger around but will give it a few more tries. Definitely the best reel to reel hip hop scene around.The staff is very attentive and professional and a few times went out of their way to make my visits great.
Came here for my birthday on a Saturday night. No reservations. First come first serve. The wait was 2 hours! Thank god for cocktails! Of course the first thing ordered was the bone marrow. It's an acquired taste. Along with foie gras and the honey fried chicken. Everything was amazing! Hence the four stars because there was no defined place to wait especially waiting for 2 hours!
"Went at midnight and still had to wait 30 minutes - but I'm not complaining; I'm thrilled that this spot commands that kind of a following!  The drink from the bar was great, staff was friendly, and the burger & fries were incredible.  I'd rather eat two-day-old Au Cheval leftovers than go to a different burger spot.  Hard to hear a conversation over the music - but the music is on point, so again, not complaining!"
"This place is unreal. THE BEST BURGER.No one gives the honey fried chicken enough credit. It is to die for. Matzoh ball soup is also noteworthy.I liked the mashed potatoes more than the fries with egg, but both are incredThey also play awesome music and have great beer. Be prepared to wait and get a drink at Haymarket"
"Just damn good. The burger is my go-to in Chicago. It is so good and their bacon should have a ""controlled substance"" classification, because that stuff is addicting. Also, had the painkiller drink and I really think it rivaled ones I've had at famous Chicago Tiki bars, it was exceptional. Definitely recommend this place, without hesitation."
"Sweeeet Baby Jesus.  This impromptu lunch changed my life.  I need to get back there for a second round so I can try their full menu's bounty.  The brunch menu is a little truncated but they had what I wanted, that gorgeous cheeseburger that's been haunting me all around the internet.  Finally it was to be mine.  We each had a burger which was perfect from bun to housemade pickle, though adding the bacon was really gilding the lily, good though it was.  We also shared the pimped out fries with the mornay sauce and egg.  Whatever to the egg of which the white part was kind of silly and weird to cut, but the mornay sauce and aioli (and I'm not an aioli fan) were good.  They also let me order an off-menu beermosa.  Score!  We got there at 12:45 on a Saturday and they told us a 45 minute wait which was an overestimate.  I love when that happens.  I need to get my butt back here ASAP to try more goodies and possibly order some pickleback shots.  Not to be confused with Nickleback in any way.  Ugh.  They get negative 5,000 stars."
"This place makes the best burger on the planet, I really can't speak highly enough of it. And don't skimp out on the bacon, seriously. The fries are also good but I'd say skip the hash browns, they weren't the most flavorful and I would've rather just got another burger. Lastly, expect a wait any day of the night if you don't get there when it opens. We got there Wednesday night at 5:15 and had to wait a solid hour. The good news is there are plenty of other good restaurants  around them so you won't have to starve waiting."
oh la la ah-mazing!!!!! downside is that they dont take reservations.
"Just like all the other reviews, definitely worth the wait!  Put your name on the list, walk across to Haymarket Brewery and have a few good beers while you wait!I highly recommend the bone marrow for an appetizer...it's interesting and unique! The bone marrow itself is just fatty and salty..but there is some kind of jelly/spread that you put on a piece of toast and everything just goes really well together! Plus, you can then say you've tried bone marrow! I probably won't order it again, unless if the person I'm with wants to try it, but it's worth it if you've never had it!The burgers are great! They do have a small menu, but you should go there for the burgers.  The overall atmosphere is really cooly.  It's a tiny restaurant, but they play some really good music!"
Au Cheval burgers are where it's at. 9.95 for a single and 10.99 for a double and a dollar for an egg on top is something you don't want to miss. The burger is very flavorful and juicy especially with the well seasoned sunny side egg on it. There's an option for the pork belly slice on top which I can do without. There's a lot of beer on tap so don't be afraid to try one. If you ask the servers they know their beers also. This place is almost always packed at least when I get there. But the wait is generally 20-40 minutes. The ambiance is not so suitable in my opinion for families or large groups. It's very dim and loud as well. They also only seat 4 at most unless you split up.
"Been to so many restaurants all around Chicagoland and it's safe to say AC is one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. Unfortunately I didn't get there till past midnight which they only offer the ""late night menu"" then but the double cheese burger was fantastic, competes with Kumas and others. Their fries with an egg on top were perfectly cooked. The atmosphere was vibrant, would be a great hang out spot. Can't wait to go there again this week  keep it up."
"The burger is definitely worth it. Is it as good as the reviews below me say it is? Yes. Is it worth the hour plus wait? Hell yes.Came here with the bf, we both had burgers, with a fried egg and bacon. Man was the first bite amazing! I'd say better than the burger at Owen and Engine. We Also got an order of crispy fries with a fried egg. That, too as delicious.  I wanted to try the bone marrow or the fois grois, but it was too much food between the both of us.For dessert we had the mille feuille.  It's like eating baclava and creamy frosting. If you're full, I would skip it.The only thing I would recommend passing on was the ten ninety imperial witbier.  It's a 10% beer, but it really tastes like baby shampoo.Overall, excellent food and an amazing burger."
Great burger!  Good crispy fries.  The wings coming out look really good as well.  Ambiance is retro feeding an average millennials idea of a cool place with good EATS.  It fits the package.  I like the style of the booths.  Those chefs work their butt off!  Look forward to going back.  Place is on the small side but we all make sacrifices for a great burger.  Top 5 Burger in Chicago.
"This is a great burger place. It was soo good. I had the single burger, which is actually 2 patties. It was very delicious and juicy.  You can actually only get the burger 2 ways....medium or well done. So for all you rare burger lovers this is not the place. Let me warn you if you try to come during lunch or busy dinner rush there will be a LONG wait. We got there at 12:30pm two different occasions and both times the wait was 1hour and 30 min. And they don't take reservations. I recommend getting there right when they open at 11am."
"My friend I and met here for dinner tonight.  Based upon the menu and the reviews, I was pretty excited to come here.We decided to split the chopped salad and French fries and each got a burger. The chopped salad was fantastic and the fries were perfectly crispy.  I followed the suggestion of others and got both egg and bacon on my burger. OH.MY.GOODNESS.  Probably was of the best burgers I've had.I will be back!"
"It's hipster. That's the only negative thing I can say about this place. The burgers are famous but are probably not even the best things on the menu. A good selection of beers. The chopped liver is DIVINE. There I said it. Divine. They serve it with dill and Texas toast.The bone marrow dish was excellent, with enough marrow to clog your family's coronaries for the next three generations.For dessert, the milfoy was huge, and not too sweet. The garlic aioli that comes with the fries is a hit. Service is excellent. I wouldn't leave Delaware, and move to Chicago for this place...Or would I...?"
"Finally decided to try this place after hearing all the hype. Simply put, they make a very good burger. If you don't mind waiting for 1-2 hours, you won't be disappointed."
The burger:a single is a double.a double is a triple. GET IT.
"Upscale bougie diners are catnip for white people.  The line was out the door on a stormy Wednesday night, and I think they had a cassette player hooked up to the stereo.  I mean, come on.We split the chicken liver and had a couple of burgers each.  The burger is a monstrosity - single actually means two patties, both cooked to a perfect medium rare.  I didn't even know you could do that with thin burgers.  The chicken liver tasted as good as cat food commercials make cat food look.  House whiskey is 3.50 a shot.  Tallboys are 3 bucks apiece.  It's like they wanted me to get belligerent."
Awesome food! Long wait but you can go to the bar across the street for drinks and they text you when your spot is ready! Burgers are amazing and the bacon is the best bacon ever!
"The wait was long, stumble into this place after a long hard day, was dying for a burger. Trust me, after having a double burger with bacon and cheese, you don't want to have any other burger, simply they aren't good enough. After peeking to the side, I ordered the bone marrow, the sauce was amazing, the marrow was amazing, leave my mouth watery while thinking about it again. Harsh brown was a little salty, but nothing a ice cold beer can't fixed. Server was helpful."
"Perhaps the best burger I've ever had! I ordered mine with an egg and bacon and I definitely recommend it. The egg was cooked to perfection and the bacon was thick and juicy and so delicious. The restaurant is a cute little place with exposed brick and industrial furnishings. Very chic. The wait wasn't too bad for a weekday lunch, but I've heard it gets pretty crowded around dinner time. I was visiting from the suburbs so I needed to valet. I don't think Au Cheval has their own valet but it was super easy to valet at Little Goat down the block."
"I came here with the boy this afternoon for lunch. We were seated at the bar next to the chef and watched him expedite the food. Coming into Au Cheval, I knew I wasn't going to leave this place feeling ""skinny"" but I didn't care. I knew this was going to be a splurge and it turns out, I didn't leave the restaurant waddling like a penguin!While we sat at the bar, the boy chatted up the chef and I watched the cooks working the line. I saw a lot of burgers on the grill. 75% of the food coming out were burgers, which I understand why after I took a bite out of his burger. It's juicy, it's soft and flavorful. I ordered the salmon rillette, which isn't listed on the menu. Thanks Chef for the secret dish! It was light, tasty and still chunky. He brought us a complimentary side of bacon as well, which was a little too sweet for my taste, but very nice and thick. I love the peppercorns on it! If only I had more room in my stomach.I'm not giving this place 5 stars because of the service from our waiter. I barely saw him and I didn't even know about my dish until the chef told us. He apologized for the delay in our food because of his mixup with something, which isn't that big of a deal. It's hard for me to digest meat like beef or chicken, but I am willing to go through the pain and misery the next time I come to Au Cheval. I want that bone marrow and foie gras!"
The hamburgers and chicken wings are always great! The only thing that i did not enjoy on the menu was a bologna sandwich. The Cocktails are also very good. Au Cheval is a must try.
"HOLY CHILAQUILES. HOLY BURGER. I thought this place was great before but omg my recent experience for brunch was terrific. Granted, I was starving and was craving some greasy food but everything was SO DELICIOUS. The chilaquiles with its fresh chips, house made guac, and amazing pickled onions. HEAVENLY. And the coveted cheeseburger with thick bacon and sunny side egg; CRYING. Simple, yet so good. Seriously one of the top two burgers in Chicago. Note: ""single"" cheeseburger has two patties. And the chilaquiles is served after midnight every night too!"
"My friend and I strolled in on a Thursday evening at 6:30pm. We weren't the only ones and the next available table was 45 minutes away. With little room to loiter around, we went to a nearby café to kill time. In some 45 minutes, we were promptly notified by text that our table was ready. Both of us had to be present in order to claim the table. The dining area is very tight with limited room for daring maneuvers. Thick, winter coats and stuffed bags are a hazard in this vintage corner!  Our dinner consisted of roasted bone marrows with beef cheek marmalade and toast, single cheeseburger, and a side of thick cut peppered bacon. Food was served within 10 minutes. I must meekly say this was my first time having bone marrow and I can't quite grasp the hype. To me, it resembled cooled grease. Maybe it's adaptive? Or there's something wrong with me? I was much more impressed with the marmalade and toast. The single cheeseburger is a misnomer served with double patties. They were perfectly sizzled with the cheese happily melting away. And forget staying slim and healthy, those peppered bacon slabs are not to be ignored. Chow down that fatty meat and feel guilty later! You won't regret it! Other than the food and environment, what was a forecast to a memorable dinner? When the friend gently and enthusiastically cues you to take a picture of her entrée before either of us digs in. She sat back in the most patient and elegant manner as I snapped away from different angles. I don't know about you, but for a food-whore, picture-snapper, that meant a lot. A whole lot."
"I went here last week with my fiance. We came here after all the amazing reviews but it definitely didn't live up. First impression was that it is very small and crowded and the wait was about 1.5 hours. We ended up eating at the bar and got the Fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli & fried farm egg which was really good. We both got single burgers and got mine with egg. My fiance really liked it but I felt like tasted it had McDonald's patties in it. I've never came across a restaurant burger that tasted that bad. I'm not sure if it was just my burger or just me but I don't get why people rave so much about this place. Overall the fries were good but not great and the burger was pretty bad. I don't think it worth the wait or the rush to go this place. I've had better burgers at Ruby Tuesday's. I gave it three stars because the fries were still pretty good and unique."
"Au chevallllllllllll so in my years (26 to be total) I've always been in search of the perfect burger and God Damn It they have it. There is no glamour nor frills about this place its a ""hippie ish diner"" that puts out a fucking awesome burger oh they also have the best bacon in chicago PERIOD!.. Service is cool, smart, witty..... But here its all about the burger...........Service- B+Ambiance- BLocation- BDrinks- AFood- A+"
"The long wait on a weekday is wroth it.  Just head across the street on a Tuesday night for half price wine while you wait.  And they will text you when your table it ready. The burger lives up to the hype, with your choice of topping with an egg or bacon (or both).  I recommend fries to share on the side."
"Au Cheval truly does have the best burger in Chicago. I've ventured to all of those restaurants that make the burger list and Au Cheval is número uno to me. Better than Kumas! The bacon is delicious and unlike any bacon you've ever had before. It's almost like a slab instead of a crisp, but it's delicious. The Hashbrowns are delectable. The vibe of the restaurant is totes up my alley. The waitresses are hit and miss. Sometimes they seem too cool, sometimes they're great. I am younger and usually get prejudice from waitstaff thinking I'm not going tip well, when in fact I always tip accordingly. If you're excellent then I'm willing to bust my bank for good service. If you're not friendly at all. My tip reflects it. Rant over. Regardless of the service, the burger is phenomenal. I love it. If you have to wait in line, which mostly likely, you will, give them you're number, go to Mariano's at Monroe and Halsted and sample some stuff for appetizers. They'll text you when your table is ready! Woo woo!"
The juiciest burger in town. It's simple with no flare. I enjoyed every bite. The fries are fresh and extra crispy. Fried chicken is in a tangy sauce which is good. The wait for 6 ppl was about 2 hrs on a Saturday night. Only downside is that most of their food is cooked in pork fat which is unfortunate for people with dietary restrictions.
"Fantastic burgers served up here. The menu deceives you, as the single burger comes with two patties. The meat is perfectly cooked, and Au Cheval's extras are some of the best. Unfortunately, I didn't add the thick cut bacon when I went, but from what I hear, it's sublime. If you can shell out the money, the foie gras comes at an additional $9 to your burger. However, I merely opted to add an egg to my burger, and that already made it all to be a decadent and rich culinary experience. Because the burger is so rich, I'm thankful they give you a fairly generous pickle spear. I'd also recommend ordering an IPA to go with your burger, as serves a great compliment. Besides the food, the drink/beer list is fairly impressive and satisfactory. The ambiance is great, providing a fun, intimate feel as well. Very worth coming here. If I ever get the chance, I'd love to return and try other things on the menu. Lastly, the max table size is four, so if you have a group bigger than that, expect to be split into separate tables. Au Cheval is best suited for small groups. For out of towners such as myself, this place is busy for lunch. I came at 12:30 on Friday, and I ended up waiting an hour to be seated. The crowds of people and the small space make things really cramped, so I wouldn't recommend waiting inside. If you can structure things to beat the lunch rush, I'd do so, in order to get the most out of your trip."
"My second time at Au Cheval was last week with Dan G., and while I like it to a certain extent, the Au C is certainly an ""Au Scene"". It's possibly one I would frequent more if it weren't such a scene to be seen. My review is of the food, service and atmosphere, which is what a restaurant is, right?Always packed, we waited by the cramped open area by the bar towards the front. I put my name in with the Hostess, who stands in front of the house music played on a reel to reel player, and waited. We didn't wait long until someone came and took our bar order. With diners seated all around the bar, that's nice service, and much needed. For our meal there was a server in training who first whispered a welcome and some other stuff I didn't hear, with our real server in tow. It was really hard to hear her, as Au C is very loud, and this happened on my first visit here- the server in training bit. Dan and I agreed it was a nice touch to train your staff, but the rest of the night being taken care of by a better trained server was a relief. We went with the Single Cheeseburger, which is actually a double with two patties. The Double is actually a triple, with three patties. Sigh. Get over yourself, Au C; just call it a Double and a Triple! I ordered mine with raw onion and when questioning our sever about the double patties on our single burger, and lack of onion, she stated my onion was under the patties, which it wasn't- honest, I looked 5 times. The burger was good, get it with the fried egg, it's excellent. We shared an order of fries, and enjoyed the nice beer list. I would have liked to have sat and enjoyed another beer, but it seemed so busy, the bar wasn't an option, and taking up the table to linger for another beer didn't seem like it would have been encouraged. /and Scene."
"So, a fellow yelper friend of mine was RAVING about this place (Kristina, you reading this?) so I just HAD to go. Honestly, I had VERY high expectations but fear not! Every single dish was better than my already high expectations. Considering the price range, the quality of the food, and the super awesome rustic ambiance - I think I'll be coming here many many more times in the future.(oh and the cute waiter with the English accent... hi I might love you)I stopped by this place at around 5:45PM on a Thursday night, and already the place seemed to be getting full very quickly. I put my name down as soon as I arrived, so when the rest of the party came, we were swiftly seated (by the bar though, so if we wanted a booth or table, we probably would have had to wait)Food (for 2 people):Chopped chicken liver, salted butter & toastCrispy potato hash with duck heart gravyFoie gras, scrambled eggs & toastChopped chicken liver - this. was. my. favorite. I personally LOVE that taste of liver (I dont even know how to describe what liver tastes like, but i'm obsessed with it). This dish came within about 15 minutes of ordering? We mentioned that we wanted to share a dish, and he recommended this one to us, and that's probably why it came so quickly, before both our actual entrees, but the timing of the entire meal was impeccable. Anyways, let's get to the point. Wow, the buttery toast was amazing - how do they manage to keep the bread so thick but not tough and dry?! And the chicken liver - oh. my. goodness. the subtle spice and seasoning on the liver was not overwhelming at all, so that you could enjoy that buttery texture and taste of the liver. Oh, I should mention that I didn't feel like the extra butter spread they gave us was necessary because the bread was already buttery and liver also has a buttery-texture. I mean, if you like butter, go for it! hahahBy far my favorite dish of the night.Crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy - I'm so curious. How did the hash stay crispy until the last bite?! Is it magic?! Anyways, can I just say that my friend and I both rolled our eyes and almost died when we took our first bites...it was that good. three different types of meat, duck heart gravy (what is it? I don't know, don't ask. It was yummy and that's all that matters) and forever crispy potato hash. Oh, and an essential fried egg on top. The portions are BIG, but don't worry, two girls finished all three dishes, so go explore. So good so good so good.Foie gras, scrambled eggs & toast - same toasts from the starter! Who the heck decided foie gras and scrambled eggs went together. I want to find you because its the strangest but MOST AMAZING combination I've ever experienced. I mentioned how I LOVE LIVER, right? Well, that's probably why I LOVE FOIE GRAS as well. And the foie gras here was cooked peculiarly - when I bit into it, it kind of gave off the sensation of ""popping""?! Anyways, WOW. SO GOOOOOD. and the sweet sauce made sure that you don't feel overloaded by the protein by the end of the meal. perrrfect. perfect.We sat right in front of the kitchen (which consisted of 3 people in an area the size of a bar booth) and watched all creation by these magicians. Seems like along with the dishes we ate, the burgers and the wings were very popular! Anyways, it was GREAT sitting in front of the kitchen - these chefs were amazing and so fun to watch. I totally want one of those egg frying pans they were using...So 3 big dishes for 2 people = $44....are you SERIOUS? SO CHEAP AHHH.ambiance + quality of food + portions of food + cute English waiter + PRICE = PERFECTIONdefinitely coming here again for their burger and wings."
"The drinks combined with the food just make this place hard to beat.  I did want to hate it, I have to be honest.  There is ALWAYS a wait.  & I hate waiting.  But there are a ton of bars nearby to drink while waiting.  Get the Hemingway.  It is my fav drink and pretty much the reason for the 5 stars.  Well that and the Bologna sandwich.  Yes I said it.  Bologna sandwich.  It's amazing.  Oh yeah and the burger.  Best burger ever.  Literally.  Also get the Salad with bacon and eggs.  The ranch is homemade and is the best ever.  I could literally order all 3 of these items (which we usually do) and be perfectly happy for the night.  If you haven't gone - def go!  But know full well you will wait 1-2 hours on Fri & Sat nights.   But the food is def worth it.  Amaze.  Recap: HemingwayBurger (Says single on the menu - you get a double.  win win)Bologna SandwichSalad w/Bacon"
"Randolph street was dead last night but walk into this place and you would never know! Good atmosphere if you like a dimly lit room with some randomly good jams. Burger was great, I got mine with a fried egg on top. They don't have ask you how you want it cooked so if you like your burger cooked more than almost medium tell them. Good late night spot."
"Great place. Ambiance is perfect, very cozy and a great place to bring an out of town guest. Make sure to put your name down and expect a wait. Get a drink at one of the bars around and be sure to watch your phone as they don't call, they text when your table is ready. Learned that the hard way. Also avoid the fried bologna sandwich (it was like eating a salt block), but def go for the foie gras! So good. Service was exceptional. Invite your waitress to take a break and sit down with you, and s/he will happily and give you all of the best suggestions!Definitely a great place to try."
My very first time. .. and won't be the last .. Very cool and trendy diner .. started with their ginger chicken for appetizers. .my my..I can lick the remaining sauce over the chicken ... Still drooling thinking bout it .. burger is great too bit salty for me but it was still delicious! !! I forgot the name of the dessert but it was heavenly good too...
"This is my favorite burger in Chicago. It's low on gimmicks compared to burger places that put 7 different things on them, but at Au Cheval less is more. Hands down, the double cheeseburger with egg is euphoric. Eat slowly.Be prepared for a long wait, sometimes as long as 2-3 hours. After they take your phone number, walk over to Haymarket, have some beers and small plates, and then come back and get the double with egg and an old fashioned. Recipe for a perfect evening.I read through the 1-3 star reviews on here, and there are some real entitled people out there. I've never had a problem with the service. With a 3 hour wait at a packed location, naturally the waitresses are going to be busy running around and not at your beck and call every minute. And if you ask about the burgers demanding a detailed explanation, perhaps the complexities of a Big Mac is more your style. This place is low on the frills.For everyone else, plan a bit ahead, and relish some of the best burgers in Chicago."
"As soon as I got to Chicago, all my friends told me I had to eat here. I'm glad they did. We ordered the burger with a side of bacon and fried egg. The bacon is ridiculous. It's so savory and almost fluffy in texture. I would get it on the side as it's so good you might want to devour it on it's own. We also got the foie grois and scrambled eggs which was awesome. However, it is heavy so we couldn't really finish it after killing the burger. Overall, Au Cheval is legit. The food lives up to the hype and it does not let you down."
"Wow, I rarely give 5 solid stars........but this place gets 6 stars. Ambiance, food, drinks, beer, music, decor and service all get 6 stars. Really great place."
"I had heard a lot about the burgers and fries and was not disappointed.  I think one of the best things about a restaurant is when it does not disappoint you.  The service was great.  We got our food when it was piping and hot.  I abhor lukewarm food.  This place was memorable to me because it felt like the food came off the stove and straight onto our table. The marrow and meat jam. Oh dear lord. Thinking about the meat jam, I am drooling.  I wish I had been more hungry or had more people so we could have ordered 3 or 4 more items.  Can't wait to go back."
"nom nom nom this is exactly what goes through my head every time Au Cheval gets brought up in conversation!  The drinks are just okay in my opinion, I prefer them a little more stiff, but the food is definitely the main event!  My favorites are the foie gras with scrambled eggs and bone marrow with beef cheek marmalade!  Both are SUPER RICH dishes and taste AMAZINGGG on my tongue!  The burger with fried egg and bacon (aka two thick slices of delicious pork belly) is also very good, and by the time I'm through with my meal I'm ready to take a Lipitor  :/Pretty small space, hard to find parking and no reservations.  But definitely worth the wait!  Been here twice already.., can't wait for another reason to stop by :)"
"went here once earlier this year, and only because i forgot that blackbird stops serving lunch at 2. probably won't be back unless dragged. service and ambiance were fine, but the food was not. the burger just tasted like salt and grease. our server recommended we add bacon and an egg. apparently people enjoy it that way. but those are the people who enjoy this burger to begin with, presumably because they've been told it's so good so many times by so many people. i can't think of any other reason. i would say this is a harmless cult and at least nobody's drinking the koolaid, but then i think of the thousands and thousands of bloated bellies and clogged arteries. ugh. so greasy. the bacon itself was the best thing on the bun, but it was so thick that it was impossible to take a bite without destroying the burger's integrity and making a sloppy mess. the egg was a mistake, considering that the burger would have been too greasy and rich even without it. i eat pretty much everything, and i'm all for decadent foods, but this one was just...unpleasant. no redeeming flavor.  we also ate the matzo ball soup. the broth was insanely salty. like salt-lick salty. despite that, the giant matzo ball itself was somehow totally flavorless. the duck heart hash was boring and--surprise!--excessively greasy. the cocktails were mediocre versions of classics that other bars make better. it also sucked paying more than we would have at blackbird for a really half assed meal. at least it was a weird time of day and we didn't have to wait two hours to be totally disappointed."
"I didn't give it 5 stars, because I need to try more food and I was on a date so....I had the crispy fry thing with the egg on top. DELICIOUS. *CAUTION*I went with someone who doesn't eat pork. Most of the menu has pork or is fried or cooked with pork fat. If this is a dietary restriction, I wouldn't advise it. We saw burgers and American cuisine and thought we'd be fine. I was, but my date wasn't. Otherwise, I plan to come back. Street parking and a decent amount of cabs. Open until 1:30 and the kitchen is open until 1am."
"Au Cheval has worked it's way into my vocabulary (it means horseback, not bareback...oops!), my belly, and my heart. They are doing everything right. The cheeseburger is hands down the best I've ever had. The patty is juicy and perfectly cooked, the sauce  is straight magic and perfectly compliments the finely chopped red onion and pickle. Au Cheval also doesn't discriminate against those who are gluten free, their answer to a GF bun are two giant hash brown patties. Oh so good! I didn't miss the bun one bit! The Hemingway Daiquiri is delicious and was always my go-to until the bartender introduced us to The Vermont. My life has never been the same...On top of the great cocktails & food, I always have a fantastic time here, maybe it's my company, the music or the all around feel good vibe....hmmm, I might just go tonight!"
"I know this is blasphemous, but I did not like the Au Cheval burger... It was just okay...The burgers at Kuma's Korner and Owen and Engine are better if you ask me.  Plus I really didn't like how low-quality the meat in the patties seemed to be to me.  If you like Au Cheval's burgers do yourself a favor and try the other places I mentioned, they have shorter wait times, better ambiances, and better burgers."
"My favorite burger in the city!  I just go for the regular ""single cheeseburger"" which is actually 2 thin patties.  You don't really need to add anything to these burgers -- the sauce, chopped onion & pickles are all you need!  The bacon here is like no bacon I've ever seen.  It's at least a quarter inch thick... and DELICIOUS.  Did I mention their fries are amazing?  I wish they would either open a second location, or expand into bigger space.  I would come much more frequently if it weren't for the wait.  Even still... I will wait for this burger.. it's just that good."
"I've made it my job to find the best burger in Chicago. This is it.What else can be said about this place, it's kinda hipster, kinda a pain in the ass to get a table (wait was about an hour-and that was on a Wednesday night), and kinda might change your life. I originally heard about this place from a friend, so I didn't look up the menu or yelp reviews first. I was honestly was slightly P-O when we finally got a table after an hour wait, dreaming of burgers, only to sit down and see it had two burger options-single and double.  I thought we were duped after trying out the usually burger joints (Kuma's, DMK...) that have 20 different burgers on the menu.  Wrong. So, so wrong.  I took a bite of that eggy, bacony delicious burger and the clouds opened, angels sang. Try it. Heads up-the bathroom is a single stall. You will thank me later for not looking like an idiot trying to kick down the door like I did."
"Best cheeseburger in Chicago! And that's saying a lot, considering all the amazing options. Kitchen closed 3-5pm for restock. Concept didn't make sense, but get a seat at the bar around 4, wait and watch! Cool learning experience watching food and kitchen be prepped! Really really great burger! Trendy cool atmosphere!"
"Meet me at the corner of awesomeness and shame!  Awesomeness as it relates to one of the best burgers I have ever had.  Cheese, bacon, and meat in perfect harmony.  The interior is also to be noted-a mashup of hipster diner, dive bar, with a rocking drink menu.  The shame comes into play when I order the chili con carne with corn chips, chicken wings, and the triple cheeseburger which my companion and I quickly consumed.  It's definitely a must stop when i visit Chicago"
"I've been meaning to try this place for a while and I finally got around it. Their burger is all you heard about and more. Get it with the bacon and egg, messy but it's the only way to go. The double burger is big enough to feed two if you are not super hungry. Also get the fries with the egg and aioli sauce. Service could be improved but I still give it a five star for food."
"I heared people are raving about this place so we decided check it out on Memorial Day. After 1 hour and 45 min wait ( they do not take reservation) we finally got to see what the buzz is all about. And here came big dissapointment - menu not very impressive,  very limited option for vegetarians (we had one person in our group). Food is just OK , very very very salty, after eating burger everyone in the group felt like they ate brick of salt. Staff was not really knowledgeable on food products thay use. Fries seasoning was good and would be better if it was less salty.  this place has nice vibe but was definitely not worth waiting for so long."
"OK the people who work here can be rude and standoffish. I wasn't really surprised by that. Despite their indifference, the food here speaks for itself. The burger is deservedly the best in America. The egg is perfectly cooked so that it runs over each and every bite. The meat is cooked perfectly to medium rare. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now. The cocktails are also delicious and there is really something for everyone. My advice is to get there right after work for ""happy hour"" before 6 or 7. Otherwise, you'll be waiting all night for a seat. Now my mission is to come back to late night chilaquiles!"
"There was a lot of hype about Au Cheval.  We're talking LeBron James coming out of high school type hype, as my friends and coworkers built this place up by labeling their burger ""the best in Chicago"".  I admit, the burger was good, but it's no the chosen one.  The Au Cheval burger is more Carmelo Anthony than LeBron.  It's good, but it's not the best, and it's definitely overpriced.The space is small and always packed.  I've gone several times before today only to go somewhere else because of the extensive wait.  You can grab a seat at one of the first come, first serve bar seats if you're lucky, or leave your number with the host/hostess and they'll text you when a table is available.  The staff is all very friendly and upbeat.  The place has a strong hipster vibe without the uppity hipster stigma.  It's a real cool setting.Between 2 of us, our order was 2 beers ($6 each), a single cheeseburger, the general jane's honey fried chicken, and hashbrowns.  The bill came out to a little over $55.  The food was good, but when a lunch has that type of price-tag, I expect to be blown away.Their single cheeseburger has 2 beef patties, and their double cheeseburger has 3.  A little odd, but I knew this going in from the intel my friends provided.  I saw several people with double cheeseburgers on their plate that went unfinished.  Each patty is 1/4 lb, so 2 (the single) is plenty.  They ask you if you want egg and bacon on your burger.  Of course I'm going to say yes to both.  Had I realized it would make my burger $5 more expensive, I may have just gone with one or the other.  The thick-cut bacon on the burger was the highlight of the meal, though, and I'm happy I got it.  The patties were fresh and juicy, but they reminded me of a medium rare beef patty from Wendys (if the fine culinary experts behind the grill at fast food restaurants were actually capable of cooking a burger medium rare).  There wasn't anything really special about it.  I enjoyed the burger, but definitely wasn't blown away.   The menu is very limited.  If your date doesn't like meat, they're pretty much sh*t out of luck.  They offer 2 different salads, but we went for the general jane's honey fried chicken.  It's a 5-piece fried chicken meal for $17.95 (1 breast, 2 drumsticks, 2 wings) saturated in their chili sauce with sesame seeds and cilantro.  The chicken was good, but the flavor was a little overpowering.I opted for hashbrowns instead of the fries.  They were pretty good, but I looked over at someone else who got the fries and immediately regretted my decision.  The hashbrowns were both crispy and greasy, but were full of flavor.In closing, Au Cheval makes good food.  You can't deny that.  They serve a lot of beers on tap that you most likely won't get anywhere else, which is also cool.  I just don't think their food is worth the price, and as for the ""best burger in Chicago"", I prefer the Bull & Bear or Rockit burger."
"NEVER AGAIN!! We went pre-Hawks game last night based on our son's recommendations that Au Cheval had the best burger in town!! Since we are huge fans of Bavettes we were excited to go. After the anticipated wait of 45 mins,that's when the experience went downhill. Dirty, unsanitary is an understatement. For an open kitchen, we observed NO hand washing after touching raw meat, the fried chicken was stored in a bin approximately 8 inches off the floor, the ketchup bottle fell off the shelf (open top first) only to have the server wipe it off with her hands and give it to the table next to us. ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE!! We ate the salad  (after inverting the bowl onto our plate, noticed that we had eaten a piece of the menu). The server said that this happens all the time and they keep a piece of paper under the bowl to stop it from slipping. YUK. The burgers were fine but I couldn't eat much after seeing the prep. The millefeuille for dessert consisted of sheets of overcooked phyllo stuffed with cream(and $12 dollars, to beat). The grunge theme is fine but that's no excuse for the cooking conditions. My stomach was hurting all night and I'll never be back. So many other great places for burgers in the city!!"
Food is awesome. But it was really crowded and friend and I ended up sitting at the bar. They cook right in front of us so it's pretty loud and even the air feels like filled with cooking oil
"Au Cheval was soooooo delicious, but heavy. I literally crawled in bed after dinner at 10pm and went into a coma-like sleep.We had a group of 6 for dinner on a Saturday night and put our name on the list around 6:30. By 8:30 we received the text that our table was ready and we headed back to Au Cheval (You have ~10min to get back and claim your table). We knew that the largest table they had was a 4 person booth, but we were ok squeezing (you may not want to do this- we are all pretty small ppl and we were basically on top of each other). We ordered 2 sides of french fries which came with a garlic aioli that I wanted to lick out of the container. They were SO good, but I was also starving and a little tipsy. Our burgers arrived quickly after the fries. I had the single (which is really 2 patties) with a fried egg AND bacon, hold the cheese. It was mouthwatering- my mouth is starting to water right now as I think back about that amazing burger. I ended up taking it off the bun and just eating the meat/egg goodness. YUM. Hmmm... maybe I'll stop by for dinner tonight."
"Food is awesome!!! Everything I've ever had  was wonderful!  Burgers, fried baloney sandwhich is off the charts amazing!!  Small place but very worth the  wait :)"
"Let me first start by saying, no matter what time you try to get in, you will wait around 2 hours at the least. Let me follow-up by saying IT IS WORTH THE WAIT. I tried foie gras for the first time here. I don't think I could have managed this without having the Texas toast and orange marmalade they serve with it. Perfect combination for a first-timer. I think I would have preferred the foie gras to be pan-seared like my friend suggested but it was surprisingly good. We tried the hash browns and crispy fries with mornay sauce. The fries had a fried egg on top. They were beyond delicious. The mornay sauce was great as well. Something different to dip your fries in. So, onto the burger!  Phenomenal!!  I did not get the fried egg or bacon on top because I wanted to experience just the burger. I am so glad I did that because of the side dishes we got. I now can say I have had the best burger ever. Lockdown was my favorite but now I think it's a 2nd to Au Cheval. I can not wait to get the burger again and next time around I won't get any side dishes but I will top the burger with the egg and bacon."
"We walked in and were greeted as old friends; a perfect way to start. Amazingly enough, we were seated immediately, we beat the Lalapoloozers!  It was 1:00 on a Monday and Au Cheval was still packed!  Root Beer on tap!  Ice cold AND the good stuff!Single cheese burgers with all the works.  ( Can someone bring me one right NOW??)  I can totally see how they have earned their recognition. It was incredible!The fries, oh, the fries!!  Enough said.We are well on are way to being old friends at this point!"
"My mouth is watering just thinking about what we ate here.Imagine every food you love if it were perfect in a way you didn't even know it could be perfect.We started with the bone marrow.  It comes with toast on the side.  The TOAST was delicious.  Like actually jaw dropping good.  TOAST.  The server gave us seconds for it.  Not to mention the bone marrow itself which was fantastic. Everything is like that.  The seating is pretty tight, and we talked to the tables on both sides, everyone is foodgasming and loving it.  The burgers, the bacon, even the mashed potatoes.  You can't go wrong. Seriously go here right away, if I had more money I would be a regular here, and I'm tempted to switch career paths just so I can have the $$$ to go here several times a week.GO. There's even a cute british server.  Seriously.  Its perfect."
"Amazing place!   My partner and I have been here twice on the past month- we live out of state but when we visit Chicago, we want excellent service and food.  We are actually here for our wedding and brought alit if friends from our hometown.  Brandon was so attentive and nice as our waiter and the burgers were to die for.  Thanks Brandon for your great service and recommendations.  Even the 'pickle backs' were so much fun.   See y'all next time,  for sure!"
It's really bs that this place website says serving from 11:00 am - 1:00am and I go there at 4:00 pm and they say there not serving till 5 ... Why wouldn't there website reflect that .. I don't know ... It's frustrating when u travel there going of there times on there website and they turn me away ... And there late night menu sucks .. So don't go there after midnight ... And all of there staff has a slight hipster better then u attitude .. Smh ... But I heard there food is great ...
"What the hell was that? Did my mouth just get raped by lard and a spice rack?! Is your food really that terrible that you need that much spice and butter. It must be cuz that was only the second time in my entire life that I did not finish my breakfast. Sorry mom! I am a bigger dude who likes to eat and am rarely soooooooooo disappointed with a meal. I ordered the Simple Breakfast, which turned out to be anything but. All I wanted was some eggs, bacon and potatoes. What I got was a large plate of butter with something you might call breakfast if you wanted a melody of contradicting flavors and three days of greasy diarrhea. I should have taken the $30 I spent, dipped it in a deep fryer, dropped it in the toilet, and then taken a giant shit. Thanks for wasting my time and money! And what is up with the one option of cheap bread that they serve? And why did my bacon have syrup on it? It tasted like peppered salt block covered in syrup. As I write this review, I just keep remembering more and more terrible stuff about this place. And there was like an hour wait! Who are the idiots that keep going back? God that place was terrible. Is there a good for suicide yelp option?"
"Very good. Great service.  Good food, damn good burger but Bobcat Bite in Santa Fe still best burger in America. 3 hour wait bit riduckulous ...guess in west loop the longer you wait the cooler the place ...meh.."
Amazing Burger! Don't get distracted by anything else on the menu but the burger and fries with an egg on it. The bacon there is to die for too and I am not even a huge bacon person. I definitely will be back here many more times!
"It really is the best burger I may have ever had!The wait thing sucks - but luckily I live just down the street so was able to put my name in around 5:45 on a Thursday and we were on our way back to eat around 6:30 (and they originally quoted closer to an hour so that was a pleasant surprise)! The bf and I went straight for the burgers (must order egg and bacon!) and we got the fries with the fried egg on top too. I usually do not eat an entire huge burger in one sitting, but there was NO way I was leaving any of that left on the plate. The fries were very good too but I was so burger focused I really didn't eat too many of them. I will certainly be back for more burgers, fried chicken, and I've heard the chilaquiles are amazing!"
This place was amazing. The best burger spot by far. Their fried chicken appetizer was amazing the burger was delicious. The bacon on the burger is amazing but the egg on top makes it a bit busy. Only reason it didn't get five stars cause the fries were horrible and you feel like an oompa loompa when you leave. Its pretty much a heart attack on a plate. But sooooo delicious. Staff is friendly but the wait is awful. Makes me crazy that they don't take reservations. Been there where the wait has been 3+ hours. The restaurant is tiny. Your sitting on top of eachother. Five stars for the food and service one star for the wait and restaurant layout.
"GOOD TASTE ,AFORDABLE TOO..first time came to here,  me,...looks like they are alive. dont have camera to take pic."
"They should call the burgers here Rockefellers, b/c they are the RICHEST burgers I have ever sank my teeth into!!! Holy cow, if you were to ask me to finish a double cheeseburger with bacon and an order of fries at just about any other place, I would say, ""No Problem!"". But Au Cheval is a completely different animal!!! Don't think McDonald's burgers for a second. Think more like 8 inch tall burger w/ bun meets thick rich chocolate, it was THAT rich.The burger was delicious, I have to say. They put some pickles and some sort of white big mac sauce of some sort on the burgers. They are juicy, moist and RICH beyond your wildest dreams. A word of advice, any diet you are on and plan on maintaining will be completely out the window if you decide to (ch)eat here. I feel like I clogged at least one artery eating this burger last night.Let me also tell you that I ordered the fries with mornay sauce and garlic aioli & fried egg. WOW, the garlic aioli was like mayo, thick rich and creamy and I LOVED the flavor. Mornay was alright, but those fries were certainly crispy and delicious!Ok so a couple things I didn't like. First of all, that I came here by myself. That was definitely my own fault b/c I absolutely wanted to try the foie grois but there was no way I could have eaten that plus the burger. So, I need to come back and split a foie grois dish and a burger.As a result of eating alone, I sat at the bar. There really aren't any bartenders though. The kitchen is behind the bar and occupies mostly all the space in that area, with the exception of a small area of the bar with all the beer taps and liquors. The chefs back there looked like they meant business. I received a couple almost serious/dirty looks from a couple of them. While I definitely enjoyed watching them cook when the kitchen opened (I got there at 4:30 and they didn't start up the kitchen until 5), I don't think most chefs make for the most personable people. They usually prefer to be in the back of house and furthest away from patrons. My waitress, Erin, on the other hand, was a sweetheart and did an excellent job of steering me in the right direction and checking back on me early and often. Also, God I hate saying this....but I got bacon on my burger and didn't like it. I just have an issue with super thick cut bacon that has the texture of ham almost. Call me old fashioned, but I prefer my bacon thinner and crispier than what I got on my burger. But, I ate it anyways, just should have skipped the bacon and I prob will next time :)"
"I have to give this place 5 stars for the burger.  It was listed on a ranking of best burgers by state, and so we decided to try it for a late lunch/early dinner after a White Sox game.  I'm glad we got there when we did, because it got very busy.  We has seats at the end of the bar which were great because I could watch all the action.  I was confused at first because no one was cooking, but they were setting up for the next round.  I went for the bacon on my burger which was really pork belly.  I might not get it next time, just because I didn't think the burger needed it.  My date had a really nice cocktail and I tried a beer.  This is definitely on my list of favorite burgers."
"Oh Au Cheval, I've LITERALLY been dreaming of you for the past year.  Ever since last November, my friends have tortured me on a weekly basis with pictures of your burgers, muffins, and other amazing foods.  When I finally booked our tickets to Chicago, I knew EXACTLY where I wanted to go.Our first night in Chi, the weather sucked.  The good news is that people were less likely to want to go out--meaning we only had to wait about 45 minutes to eat at Au Cheval.  When the menu came out, I pretended that I didn't know exactly what I wanted... but after looking at the menu for a few minutes I stopped fooling myself.  I got the cheeseburger Au Cheval (with fried egg and bacon!) and a side of foie gras.  Our table also ordered the hash browns, roasted marrow bones, beef cheek marmalade, and toast, and their specialty dessert (which I'm blanking on the name right now).  My burger was AMAZINGGGGG.  I don't know what it is, the meat itself is perfectly cooked, the bacon has so much peppery flavor, and the egg--perfect!  It was sooooooooo filling that I really don't know how I ate anything else.  But of course, I ate other stuff too... The roasted marrow bones with beef cheek marmalade and toast was also amazing.  We got bone marrow at a couple different restaurants on this trip and this was BY FAR the best of the bone marrow.  Perfectly cooked and with the best accompaniments... and the toast was amazing too!  The portion was a bit smaller than I had hoped, but for the price and taste, you really couldn't complain.  I just snatched a little piece (because my friend ordered this for his entree) but omg, drool.The hash browns were a side item that we ordered for the table.  Alone, they are awesome... now if you dip them in a little garlic aioli--super nom!The dessert--sigh, at this point, I was stuffedddddd.  But I always make room for dessert!  I forgot what it was called but it was basically layers of pastry dough and cream.  The way they serve it is so cute, they take a knife and hack it in half so that you can see all of the layers.  The cream was awesome, and not overly sweet.  Now we were so happy with everything, that we came back again for brunch on Saturday (we went there for dinner on Wednesday).  For brunch, Hubs and my friend ordered the burger again (but on a hash brown bun instead of a regular one), I got the foie gras and scrambled eggs, and our friend ordered the yogurt parfait.  We also got some muffins for the table.We started with the muffins--simply put, AMAZING.  They were served with butter, blackberry jam, and chocolate syrup.... the muffin was already awesome by itself, but with the toppings, I was literally in heaven.  I could've eaten 5 more of those (but probably would've blown up afterward).My foie gras and scrambled eggs were good, but not amazing.  Amazing was the yogurt parfait with their ""homemade"" granola.  Light and airy and wonderfully refreshing.  I loved the fresh fruit that it came with as well.Anyway, I recommend everyone and anyone go to Au Cheval for the best meal of their life... I'm already counting down the days till I get another one of those muffins.  #Yelp100Challenge"
"This burger was ridiculous. Straight ridiculous. I haven't written a review in like 2 years, but I just need to write about this incrediburger.My buddies and I were visiting Chicago and ate across the street at Girl and the Goat because it had a bunch of reviews or whatever. I'm a huge burger with egg fan so my buddy recommended this place and said it has a great burger with egg. So after dinner... We went to go the real dinner. My God it was truly a burger sent from heaven.Our waiter, Maggie, was awesome too. Such a homie and she got us stoked for our meal. Super cool. My buddy and I split a burger since we had just stuffed ourselves from the previous meal. After eating the most delicious burger ever... We just had to order another one... So we did. And it tasted just as good as the first half.This burger is ridonculous and I'll definitely be back to hang out with Maggie and eat the greatest burger in Chicago? Possibly the greatest burger in the world.the Great,GumZ"
"Yes, I am a fan. Burger, great. Chicken, great. Beer, excellent. They have this beer called Creepy Ginger - from a local brewery I was researching and they don't have it at stores but they have it on draft SO GOOD!!!! Compliments my burger  beer and burger cant go wrong!"
"I came here with two girlfriends at 5:45 on a Tuesday. We were lucky and there was no wait when we arrived, although by the time we left, there was definitely a wait. We shared the fried chicken as an appetizer and we each got a cheeseburger. The chicken was finger licking good. The sauce had a nice little kick too it but wasn't overly spicy. The burger was perfect. I loved the mayo too!"
"Absolutely exquisite. Our waitress Erin was phenomenal, recommended some other establishments to visit, provided great recommendations and was very engaging. Food was outstanding. Everyone ordered the Burger and gave it rave reviews. Bacon was amazing, pickle lovers loved the pickles, bread was on point.We had one vegetarian... He really enjoyed the salad.Cocktails were good as well... Vieux Bonal is my cocktail of choice!A must stop if you are in the Chi!!"
"Wow, two 5 star restaurants in one weekend!We went to Au Cheval after Taste of River North on Sunday night. Everything was perfect besides the extremely rude hostess. We arrived around 8:30 and she told us it would be an hour and a half wait. Totally fine as we expected a wait. She reiterated that when they text you that your table is ready, you have 7 minutes to get back. Understood. We hopped across the street and grabbed a beer at Haymarket. We received the text, replied that we were cashing out, and dashed across the street. When we arrived and told her who we were she was like ""Well I will have to see if we still have a table for you..."" in the snobbiest way possible. The guy next to her was like ""Yeah, we do."" in almost a dismissive tone to her (we laughed.)From there on everything was great. Atmosphere is loud, but not too loud. Dim lighting with overhead accent lights centered on the table. Waitress was awesome. Now, to the food. This is the best burger I have ever had. It is not some extravagant burger with a zillion toppings trying to make up for the lack of quality elsewhere. It is a simple burger that tastes phenomenal. The fries were great, perfectly crispy and salted just right. We were each going to order one but the waitress suggested we just get one for every two persons, as they are share-able. Kudos to her!Overall it exceeded my expectations. The rest of the menu looked great as well, so I will be back and try something different (although that will be tough!)"
I am a fan of the breakfast burger.  Great wait-staff - they operate like a well-oiled machine.  Great ambiance.  Reminded me of home.
"Dear Danielle (our waitress at Au Cheval),I just wanted to thank you for ruining my first experience at Au Cheval.  My friends have raved about this place and I decided to stop by with 3 other guests on a Monday evening.  If you don't remember, we were seated in the corner booth table.Just to refresh your memory, we started off by ordering a (2) hefe weissbier and a glass of pinot noir.  You recommended the two beers to us when a friend asked for a Blue Moon, but you decided to respond to her slightly with an attitude, as if Au Cheval is too cool to carry that type of beer.At this point, I didn't think much of it until you came by 10 minutes later to take our order.  Seriously, 10 minutes??  It wasn't even that busy, so how about you try to be a little more attentive?  I was thinking about ordering the open face fondue, so I asked you what you thought of it.  Once you told me that it was more of a fondue instead of a sandwich, I immediately asked you what you thought of the burgers.Me: ""How are your burgers, I heard they were really good here.""You: ""They're good.""Me: ""........""Seriously, that's all you have to say about the burgers?  Thanks for the wonderful insight, it sure helped my decision making process.Immediately after I decided to get the burger, you became very antsy and told us you'd be back later once we made up our mind.  Do you not have 10-20 secs to spare?  We were ready..but you decided to leave.Another 10 minutes pass by and you FINALLY for the love of god decide to come back.  Whew, I seriously thought you forgot about us.  Glad to know that you're not forgetful...*Pro Tip*  When you see that we're out of water, I think most people would notice it and refill our flask.  I mean come on, it's been empty for 15 minutes and you haven't noticed?  It was only until I had to chase you down that you brought it out.  When our check came, our group decided to stick around and hang out.  I saw you slowly coming to our table from the corner of my eye.  I had my arm over the check because I was wondering if you came to the table to grab signed check.  I was horrified when you grabbed the check from under my arms while we were still drinking and eating.  I was speechless and in shock.DO NOT GRAB THE CHECK FROM THE TABLE WHEN THE PARTY IS STILL THERE!  This is a big freaking no-no.  P.S.  Our total tab was $84.  I left you a $20 tip because I was too lazy to wait around and wait for my change for 10-15 minutes.  That $20 was undeserving, and looking back I immediately regret my decision to give you that tip.  P.S.S  Never have I seen you with a smile the entire night.  Try to smile more, you'll be surprised how much it helps.P.S.S.S.  The food was great!  But thanks for ruining the evening.  Never will I come here again."
"Felt like a restaurant in San Francisco's Mission District.  Didn't have my bicycle or wore a tanktop to show off my tatts.Double cheeseburger with fat cut bacon and a fried egg.  Also a side of double order foie gras.  Burger is superbly juicy, hot and fresh especially sitting at the bar in front of the line.  Brioche bun was soft and worked well with the piled high double patty and toppings.  All american great salt and pepper seasoning.  If you're craving a no bullshit non foo foo burger, this will satisfy indeed.Great service and great draft selection."
"I will be dreaming about the amazing brunch I had at Au Cheval for weeks to come...heck, probably until I return......which I definitely will be!We stopped by when they opened at 11am on a Saturday and were the only ones there for a good 15 minutes...a little awkward when you're outnumbered by staff but we were ready for brunch!  We started with Bloody Marys (a MUST!) and shared a doughnut from the Doughnut Vault while waiting on the rest of our food...odd combo, yes...but each delicious in their own ways.  Our group of 4 was split down the middle-2 ordering the English Breakfast and 2 ordering the Crispy Potato Hash with duck heart gravy.  Both dishes were OUTSTANDING and I would be perfectly happy with either one (although I do have a special place in my heart for a solid English breakfast)!The bacon is thick, sweet, and a must-try.  The scrambled eggs that came with the English Breakfast were ridiculously good...I didn't know it was possible for something as simple as scrambled eggs to be that much better than anything I've ever had.   Baked beans, a giant roasted tomato, and thick toast round out the plate and if you reach the bottom they'll surely be rolling you out of there.  5+ stars, can't wait to return!"
"Auuuuu shiz it's good. My boyfriend and I got the standard everyone else gets here. It surely lived up to it's hype. Only thing was we got there around the closing time between lunch and dinner and I felt sort of rushed. But the food was great. The fries, oh the fries."
"Really, really rich... I think that's the best way to describe the food here.Split the burger (topped with bacon and an egg) and the General Jane's chicken and really those two dishes in itself were very filling. The chicken was very nice and crispy and the sauce was really good. It was reminiscent of Great Sea's hot and saucy wings, but different. Definitely seemed crispier. The burger was just so rich. I can see why people would say this is the best burger in Chicago. It is definitely up there, but i'd need to compare burgers closer together in timeframe (been eating mostly vegan) to really make a decision on that part. Service was phenomenal! They dropped off a bottle of water at the table, but the barback always kept coming by to fill our glasses for us. Really friendly servers as well. Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience."
This place lives up to all the hype. We each had the Au Cheval burger with fries egg and bacon. We got bacon as a side and fries as a side. The burgers were delicious. The bacon seemed more in the pork belly realm(texture wise) and was absolutely unreal good. The fries were crispy and the aioli was spot on. One of the better burger experiences that I've ever had. The atmosphere is great and the place is designed cool.
"Waited over 2.5 hours to eat here, which was an interesting experience, because once you're seated, the service was EXTREMELY fast. It didn't feel pushy, which was good, but I was also, by that point, very hungry, and had just spent 3 hours with the person I went to dinner with, so I didn't feel too disappointed by this.By the end of the wait, I was wondering if it would be worth it. Long story short, IT WAS. Probably the best burger I've ever had. We ordered double cheeseburgers with egg, a side of thick cut Canadian bacon, and fries with aioli + egg. A bit too much fried food, could have done without the bacon, but the burger and fries were delicious. We had a ton of leftovers, and those were great, second day. My favorite part of the meal was their housemade root beer - so much flavor! All in all, would go back, despite the wait."
"Playing along the diner experience, Au Cheval does the burgers, toast, and etc. in a unique way. They're taking that humble American staple of a diner to a new culinary level and making that shit a foodie's wet salivating dream.The service is impeccable; each order is actually timed by waiters and chefs to do their best to not have their customers waiting. The diner has a decor that is contemporary fusion of a traditional diner meets dim-lit French restaurant. But aside from the great service and nice ambiance... we all want the food.I'm a fan of burger and eggs topped on basically anything but the runaway hit on this menu for me... The Bone Marrow.That baby is cooked with the fire on top rather than the bottom which causes the meat being cooked rather than the fucking bone. It's slathered with that virgin, salt, and parsley. Not too mention that beef cheek marmalade to smear your delicious buttery toast. Tastes like fucking victory."
"I would never describe myself as a burger person, but I love Au Cheval.  After going there the first time, I went back about two weeks later.  The burgers are incredible.  I had a single burger and split an order of fries with someone, and it was more than enough.  If you're going for lunch, you really have to get there by 11.30/11.40 if you want to beat the rush, otherwise you're going to have to wait.  Seating is scarce, so if you're going in a large group you'll probably have to wait for a bit regardless, but you can always get a drink at the bar or one of the surrounding bars while you wait."
Definitely one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life.Just so you know a single is a double and a double is a triple.You can get bacon and/or an egg on your burger (both are highly recommended)Added bonus: the atmosphere and service is almost as good as the food.
"I am giving this A-OK ONLY because I have now been a few times and I don't love waiting :) That said, I do think they have one of the best, if not the best, burger in the city (and I eat a LOT of burgers). The service is very friendly, they have a really good beer list as well as cocktails and wine, and they do serve more than burgers, but after waiting for 45 minutes to two hours, why would you get anything else :) There are plenty of other bars in the area to rest your feet and have a drink while you wait, and they will take your cell phone number and text you when your table is coming up, which I really appreciate. So, I like going once in a while as long as I am not starving. I would definitely recommend it if you've never been or are in town for a short time."
"We arrived 45 mins before the kitchen was open. While waiting to be seated, we had sat at the corner of the bar to order drinks. I had moved the bar stool so my boyfriend dad could sit down. The hostess came up to me and yelled at me for moving the bar stool. When we got finally got seated, we were rushed to order our food. While finishing up our food the busboy kept trying to take away our food when we were still finishing it. Our bill was $500+ we should have received better service especially for the price of the entrees and drinks. Horrible service! Never going here again."
"I've been here 3 times now and the wait has been around 2 hours each time.  Came here once for my birthday, once for my brother's birthday, and once this past Saturday because some friends haven't tried it yet. I would normally put my name down and go across the street to Haymarket for drinks until i get a text that my table is ready.The food is phenomenal and super heavy. Food coma is surely to follow after a meal here. I would not suggest going with a large group since the place is small and you will need to squeeze to fit.I've had different things every time I've been here.Double Cheeseburger: Talk about a great burger, this is one of the best I've had in Chicago. Get it with the bacon and egg. The bacon is not those thin slices but thick slices. The burger here is better than Grange hall and rival that of Three Aces.Bone Marrow: Have to get this every time, it is delicious. Spread some rich bone marrow on the texas toast with some of the meat jam. Talk about heaven.Foie Gras with eggs: This was alright, a little sweet for my taste since I wasn't expecting it and weird combination with the eggs.Foie Gras Terrine: This was good. The buttery foie gras spread with some nice orange marmalade on the top of toast.Pork Porterhouse: This thing was massive. The porterhouse itself was good, the apple foie gras was a little weird though. I only say that because I don't like soft apples.General Jane's Chicken: To put it, this is basically Harold's fried chicken mixed in general tso's chicken sauce. Nothing wrong with it and it was good, but didn't blow my mind.Fried Bologna Sandwich: This was super tasty.  Don't really know how to describe but just get it.French Fries: Pretty standard fries with great seasoning, the garlic aioli that came with it though, fantastic! All in all, it's hard to not leave this place with a happy stomach. The only thing I would change is the wait! If you haven't tried this place, you have got to go at least once."
"Madness!!!!!My table went crazy after we had split the double cheeseburger.  ""Top 5 burger"" someone said, ""Top burger in Chicago"" another person said, ""#3"" said my wife, ""lets order another"" I said!!!!  And so we did.  A second double Cheeseburger to be split.  And this was after the delectable Chopped Liver and Toast, the rich Roasted bone Marrow and Beef Heart Marmalade, the fries with an egg on top, the Salmon and the fried chicken.  Perhaps the smooth Old Fashioned's were getting to our head.  Perhaps they weren't and this burger was just that good.  You'll have to go to find out I suppose.4.5 stars (taking a .5 star off for the really awkward server that we had)Space was cool.  Great beer selection.  Go early or be prepared to wait.  Mmmm, Cheeseburger....I will dream of you until we meet again."
"I hate when people over-hype a place.  This was one of those cases.  Fortunately I came right after work and had no wait time.  The beer selection was nice but the main attraction is of course the burger. It was good but not great.  I can definitely name quite a few better burger spots in the city.  Long story short, I would come back but would not wait longer than 20 mins to eat here."
"I want my money back. I've been trying to go here for  awhile to try these burgers. The 2 hour wait on the weekends has always gotten in the way. Don't walk in hungry, you will wait at least 2 hours to eat after you sign in for a table. So i finally decided last weekend damn the wait, i will plan my hunger with the table wait time and finally sit down and have one of these burgers with my date. We sit down and I realized the menu is actually pretty small. They have a couple burgers on the menu but definitely not what i expected. What does catch my eye is this porterhouse on the menu.  its $38 and 32 ounces i believe... I was like wow a steak sounds great. My date said i should go for it she'll get the burger and that way we can bother share each dish. The waitress comes over and is getting our order when she mentions that the steak is actually a special that night and there is only one left.  Basically at that point i was no longer on the fence about the steak. It was a 32 oz with foie gras and apples dressing. awesome. she took my order and walked away. a couple seconds later i realized she didn't ask me how i wanted the steak. I call her back and said BTW i would like the steak medium. She said oh don't worry its already medium. That was puzzling but it didn't click until ten minutes later when the steak was done and at the table. I was like that was too fast. then i realized it was a roast and not a grilled steak.they only had 1 left because they had been trying to sell it all night and I'm the sucker that bought it. it was so thick it was laid on is side like a roast. I took a couple bites and it tasted like a roast. not a steak. and the worse part was the mere mention of the word porterhouse implies a full filet attached to the bone. It had been trimmed off.The waitress came over and asked us how it was and the look on my face said it all.  even if it was grilled, it would have been the saddest looking porterhouse ever. It was like the good porterhouses had been trimmed and the chef decided to roast the last bit and cover it up with sauces. The only reason i didn't have them take it back was because i was on a first date and i didn't want to cause a scene. I paid 40 dollars for pot roast.  ridiculous. The waitress added at the end, oh I'm sorry i forgot to tell you its a roast. The best part of the restaurant was the bacon on the burger. it is very thick almost whole pork belly sized, but it was also the saving grace of an otherwise average burger. Not worth the time and effort to ever come back here."
I went for a Sunday brunch.  It was sooooooo good!!!!!!!  That bologna sandwich is great  So are the fries with the Alioli.
"Great burgers, friendly staff, fabulous ambiance! Love the whole feel of the restaurant. Have never been disappointed by the food! Love the whiskey pickle back!"
"Meeting an old friend here for dinner! Everything is incredible! Love the single cheese burger with an egg! The Bloody Mary is good, but it taste more like a meal than a drink...too much stuff! Everything else is awesome! My first foie gras dish and it was divine!"
"It's been a while since I've been here but I'll do my best to tell you that It is the most delectable burger i've had in EVER. I don't care about the fries or anything else on the menu. The burger is like a Flawless Victory in your mouth, everytime you take a bite. I mean I would honestly praise whatever meat deity found it acceptable to bless Randolph and Halsted with their burgers. The bacon tastes as if they are curing the bacon in the kitchen themselves. I remember it being sweet and peppery and just the most amazing compliment to my already deliciously cooked burger. My 5 year old nephew was with me and he couldn't help but to exclaim, ""This is a really good sammich!"" (He doesn't understand the difference between burgers and sandwiches)But seriously, if you're looking for a good burger, please go here and wait. I promise it will all be worth it."
"While Au Cheval doesn't need my review, the place seems to keep a VERY STEADY draw and one can expect an HOUR wait... I did have an awfully tasty burger.For your caloric planning; a SINGLE burger IS a single patty whereas a DOUBLE really is a TRIPLE PATTY behemoth. Lard it up further with an egg and some of the ridiculous bacon... I don't even want to calculate how many calories I just consumed.Good brioche bun that is sturdy enough to contain all of this meatocolypse while nice and pillowy. Absorbs juices very well, but this is still a deliciously messy affair.  Sharp cheddar, smear of a variant of ""special sauce"" mayo and really good, garlicky pickles. Burger meat is good stuff, nice crispy char from the flat-top, tad bit overdone but still quite good and well seasoned.The bacon is for sure the THICK BELLY variety and excellent. Not too smoky and added a nice chew. Egg was PERFECTLY sunnyside up. Yolk is runny, whites are firm.Good set of fries with a tangy garlic aioli to dip fries in. I'd usually also slather garlic aioli on my burger as well, but there was PLENTY of this, that and the other, so it was unnecessary.Service was fine. We had a waitress who vibed with us and took well to some of our teasing and she played right back.Impressive beer selection; but I'm more of a wine drinker these days and found a very tasty Barbera d'Alba that worked great with my burger."
"I like Au Cheval a lot. The music is always on point and the crowd very eclectic. The burger, fries, wings, ham/cheese fondue... all so yummy. Its a bit crowded at times and there is little waiting space which is sometimes a bit annoying. Outside of that, everything is just right."
"Wow. Can't believe I allowed myself to not come here for over a year because of the fear of the wait and that it's a somewhat upscale place. While the wait can be drag, come by early and put your name down as they'll text you when your table is ready. I came when it opened at 11am on a nice sunny Saturday and immediatley got seated around 11:20 when all my friends arrived. OMG. Foie gras scrambled eggs. Mind blowing. I generally avoid scrambled eggs beause they're often overcooked and dry. Not these babies. The scrambled eggs are soft scrambled and creamy, and paired with the red wine-based sauce and the foie gras.... let's just say it's orgasmic. It comes with thick-cut buttery toasted bread which is a texture contrast with the dish, but next time I'll ask for a side of that potato hash that comes with the duck heart gravy dish (which is also delish).Friend got a burger with their thick-cut bacon. I wasn't actually a fan of the bacon because it's got a ham-like taste probably because it's cured. I'm a huge fan of melt-in-your-mouth pork belly, but not the ham-esque bacon - which interestingly is how the pork belly is at Green Street which I kinda don't like either.Mmm. Can't wait to go back."
"#1 - As many of the other reviews have mentioned, be prepared to wait. We came at 11 on a Thursday night and still had a little wait. #2 - They serve food LATE. Always good to know. #3 - The ""best"" burger in the city is also one of the most expensive. At $11 for a single patty +$4 for bacon and + $3 for an egg, it's an $18 burger and that doesn't include fries (which are $6!) Also, the burger is good but not the ""best"". #4 - This is definitely is a cool place and with that comes the vibe that maybe it's too cool for you. Glad I went to check it out. Won't be back anytime soon."
"I only chose one star cause I couldn't choose zero. Do NOT give this company your business. Just about all of their locations are full of attitude without living up to what they think they're so special about. Yeah au cheval has a good burger, but how hard is it to make a burger?!  I much rather get a burger at any of the other million restaurants in Chicago that appreciates my business, doesn't have attitude, doesn't think they're too cool for school and actually knows what hospitality really is."
Delicious burgers.  FYI: single is a double and a double is a triple.
"Cool, well laid out busy spot!  Really nice selection of beer/wine.  Just ordered a CB with Fries as it was 2:59pm and they close the kitchen from 3-5pm?  Anyway, it was good but far from ""Best in Chicago""!! Hated the white sauce and the diced ""Pickle""?  At nearly $17 for burger/fries I really don't get the hype.. Guess I'll have to go back during ""Normal Hours""!  Get Dat Did"
"Au Cheval's double cheeseburger is the best burger I have had in a long time.  It's rich and delicious and so thick that I had to eat it with a fork and knife.  I got the fried egg on top and it was definitely worth it.The downside of Au Cheval is the long wait before you get seated.  We went on a Friday night, and the host said that the wait for a table for two was approximately 2.75 hours.  We were able to get seated earlier than that, but I'm not sure whether that is always the case.  They don't take reservations, so don't go if you're in a hurry or if you are hungry already."
"I have been wanting to try the burger here, and my wish came true on Saturday.  We got seats at the bar, which was awesome.  The bar is mainly an area that overlooks all the kitchen and cooking action.  I loved watching everything!  Our drinks were great, and we both enjoyed the double burger with an egg on it.  Sad to say that this was not the best burger ever.....BUT  cannot wait to return, as the fried chicken, hashbrowns, and bone marrow all looked fabulous!Chic and cool place to visit!"
"We got there around 10 minutes after doors opened for dinner. We were quoted a wait time around 40-60 minutes. Honestly, the wait isn't too bad if you grab a beer next door or across the street. I got the single cheeseburger with an egg. I don't know if it was the buzz from the beer, the hunger, or the sheer delicious quality of meat. This burger was phenomenal. Fries were also so yummy. There's something about the burger that just takes me back to my childhood. YUM"
"Hands down some of the best burgers I have had in the Chicago area. I would highly recommend adding an egg to your burger, just do it you can thank me later (burgers and eggs are always amazing together). I try to go here as much as possible but the one downside is there is always at least an hour wait to get into this place.. kind of annoying but still the burgers are well worth it."
"I had sort of forgotten about Au Cheval until two weeks ago. Best, best, best burger and fries (and garlic aioli)! Hover around the bar and wait for a seat to open up vs. leaving and waiting for them to call you."
"We knew the wait would be a bit, so we planned ahead by putting our name in @ Au Cheval.  They'll call you when they're ready. We then headed a couple blocks over to The Publican for pre-dinner cocktails, but that's a story for another review...Once the main event began @ Au Cheval, it was a non-stop onslaught of delicious.One very important tip to note is what I call the Rule of Italian Grandmas.  It goes like this:If you want a single, you're going to get a double.  If you want a double, you're going to get a triple.  That's the way things go with Au Cheval's burgers.  So, order accordingly.We also snagged two cups of fries (for five people) & a monstrous puff pastry for dinner.  Cocktails & tallboys also graced the table.  They were all top notch."
"You'll have to wait... most likely a long time. But trust me, it's totally worth it.I wen't with a friend and we decided to try a little bit of everything. First impression: cocktails. Imaginative takes on old classic and they were beautifully done. I would recommend the Horse's Neck.Then came the food. We ordered three items: A double cheeseburger with bacon and an egg, the fries with an egg on top, and the wings. Every single dish was outstanding! The burger was cooked to perfection along with the fries. The fries were served with a killer aioli as well. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better ""Diner"" in Chicago."
Great staff and amazing food. Highly recommend the single cheeseburger with egg. (It's actually a double patty burger cooked exceptionally well.) The beer menu and music selection was very well curated. It was worth the two and a half hour wait!
"Brunch menu on Sundays, but you can still get a burger.This burger is really somethin! Greasy, cheesy, soo good!  And the fries (what is that crispy coating?!), and the bacon, and the garlic aioli!  You will not be disappointed, you will only want to come back to try that piled high bologna sandwich that passed your table a couple times, as well as the liver and eggs situation, just out of curiosity!  A bit dark for a sunny Sunday morning, reminded me a tiny bit of Kumas for some reason....don't question yourself for not joining the little goat line, check this place out!  Bon apetite can't be wrong, right?"
"I came here with a friend that claimed this was ""the best burger ever!"" I got the burger with bacon, egg and cheese like my friend recommended. The bacon is crazy thick! It's more like pork belly than just normal bacon. The burger was good, but I don't know if I'd call it the best ever. It was really really rich. I think that is the best way to describe it. We also got the chilaquiles and fries w/ mornay sauce, garlic aioli & egg on top. The chilaquiles were my favorite. I think I enjoyed those even more than the burger. The fries didn't have much flavor.My friend hyping this place up, along with all of the phenomenal yelp reviews, probably gave me unrealistic expectations. The food was good and I would definitely recommend this place and try it again, but I wouldn't call it the best burger ever."
"Amazing food. Had the single cheeseburger with bacon and it was the best I ever had. The server was an idiot. I asked for a beer recommendation that is hoppy, and she recommended their ""hoppy apple cider."" Apple cider is made from fermented apples, there's no hops in the fermenting process.... I just shrugged that off because the food was so good. The wait is extremely long, so grab a table and go down the street for some drinks before they text you to get seated."
"The food is a solid 5+ star culinary experience here. Well, the burger anyway. Get the burger!!!!! My first time I had to fight tears and felt I was being touched by the divine. Soooooo good. The host on a Friday night is a solid 1 star. Her job is to manage expectations. She failed completely. I was quoted 1.5 to 2 hours 2.5 hours ago and I'm still waiting. She has texted my party to say that there is a table for me, but each time we go check in there is NO table, but rather at least another 15 minute wait. This is not the way to run a business!!!! I love the burger, but the customer service is atrocious. I used to be a host so in understand it can be hard, but double the time quoted? WTF Au Cheval? You can do better."
"Every dish is delightful, so great it leaves you wondering what's their secret?!?! You have to try this place. Even though the wait is long you can explore a bar near by (we went by Nellacote and had a drank) when our table was ready the staff from AC text us to come back. My second time there and still just as good as my first time!!"
"A self-proclaimed ""high-end diner"", Au Cheval is 50% bar, 50% restaurant, and 100% excellent.The atmosphere, the service, the food, everything - just excellent. I really love the menu here. It pulled me in so many different directions, even though I inevitably knew I had to get the burger. I had read their article in Bon Appetit, wherein the magazine touts that Au Cheval is their most favorite burger.ever. And I had of course sifted through dozens of yelp reviews, all of which proclaimed their love for this burger. So, even though I'm not a huge burger person, I couldn't not get it.At first bite, I certainly did not regret my decision. I'm actually ashamed of my mentality prior to consuming this masterpiece; I had felt a tad bit like I was settling on this menu item, when in actuality, my thoughts should have tended towards impatience and anxious anticipation of experiencing this acclaimed concoction. Nevertheless, all of the reviews and articles written up in praise of this burger held true. This burger was fantastic. Though listed rather modestly on the menu as either a ""single cheeseburger"" or a ""double cheeseburger"" with no frills or any sort of flowery description, this guy is a standout.To break it down further:The Brioche Bun - supplies the perfect amount of bready component, enough to give the collective some substance, yet it's super soft and not too heavy as to overwhelm the burger and the eater. The Condiment Additions - minimal. A perfectly small portion of chopped red onion with their special bread and butter pickles and a mild dijonaise all rest atop the bottom half of the bun and lie directly under the first level of meat - this is how my burger was served, though I've seen pictures with the condiments on top of the first patty and under the top bun...just a note.The Burger - the single cheeseburger is served up as two patties, and per the Bon Appetit article, each patty is comprised of four ounces of pre-formed prime beef. The burger is the definition of a perfect griddle burger: just about 1/4in thick, I'd say, with the perfect level of flavortown juiciness and a delicate crispness from an exterior crust, so to speak, on account of its cooktop preparation. Amazing.The Cheese - slices of melty cheddar that appear permanently affixed to the top of each patty contribute an unparalleled sense of ooey gooey goodness and provide wicked levels of flavor that cut the heightened beefiness that two (or three) burgers supply.Being the meatatarian and bacon lover that I am, I also had to order a side of their thick cut peppered bacon. In a word: richly-fatty-mapley-peppery-porktastic goodness.As a whole, Au Cheval is fantastic. I cannot wait to explore more of their menu. The General Jane's Honey-Fried Chicken...the omelette with spinach, blue cheese & caramelized onion...the English breakfast with bacon, baked beans & roasted tomato...the crispy fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli & fried farm egg...the fried house-made bologna sandwich...I cannot wait to eat you all."
"I cannot say enough good things about this place and the wait is absolutely worth it (especially if you dip into Lone Wolf or Haymarket to ride it out with a drink). There are so many things on this menu that looked amazing, so it's a good thing we came as a group of 4. And it's a good thing we're all sharers. We split the fried bologna sandwich which is piled high with house made bologna. There was some kind of melty, cheesy goodness in there that made the sandwich a salty, meaty, decadent treat. As great as it was, a quarter of it was enough for me. We also split the burger, which is hailed as the best one in the city. I haven't tried enough burgers to make that claim, but it's definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had...and I normally find bacon burgers a bit much. We also shared the General Jane's chicken - so, so delicious. Sweet, spicy, sticky, crunchy, it was incredibly mouthwatering and satisfying. The moist towels they give you are a nice and absolutely necessary touch because you'll want to use your hands to get all up in that chicken. We rounded out the table with the crispy fries with the egg, mornay sauce, and garlic aioli which is a pretty simple dish by Randolph Street standards, but it's out of the this world. The fries are crispy, the egg yolk is deliciously runny, and the mornay sauce, oh God...why isn't everything covered in mornay sauce??  Au Cheval is one of my favorite places in the city and has so far never disappointed. The service is friendly and the ambiance is lively, if a little crowded...but that's how you know you're in a good place, right? Next on the list to try: the roasted marrow bones."
"I've only tried a few other burger places in Chicago prior to coming to Au Chavel: Umami burgur, Grange hall, Busy burger. Au Cheval is comparable to the others, but not that much better. Their beer selection is excellent and the menu is interesting, pricing is decent. I think Umami burger in Wicker park has more unique and interesting flavors. Au Cheval is also more pretentious and makes their customers wait a long time before being served, has no reservations. They should make an effort to meet the demand by expanding or increasing seating capacity."
"Au Cheval does not disappoint.  Now I understand why it's so hard to get into this place.  Nevertheless, making customers wait for close to 2 hours for a table should be a felony.  We started off with the Chicken Liver spread and then all had the cheeseburgers with the fries.  Reviewers are right about having everything with the egg, which we learned is what the name of the restaurants means.  This cheeseburger does not disappoint like other so called best burgers in Chicago that is served with 2 patties.  The menu looks promising as I would like to come back to try some the other items with egg.  The only setback is the wait they make each customer go through just for a table."
"Excellent burgers as advertised. Perfectly done and you should get them as they suggest with THEIR pickles, mustard, mayo, etc. The single cheeseburger is huge and comes with a knife stuck in the excellent bun. Use it or risk stuff falling on your lap. Here's the big tip though. Order the side dish of house made bread and butter pickles. They are unbelievably good. I love pickled everything (I live in NC, so you have to eat pickled stuff). These bread and butter pickles are outstanding. You can get good fries anywhere, but great pickles are few and far between. The setting is basically a casual pub/bar. Service is good (I sat at the counter but had a waiter come from behind instead of on the other side of the counter). Anyway, this place is all it is cracked up to be."
"We love this place. Food is AMAZING! In addition to the insane burger/fries/fried bologna, the appetizer that is made 2x randomly in the week is a must! Hubby and I make a point to bring all our visitors here. Everyone raves about it! Service is great, Erin, Danielle, Elise, David, the host stand and the rest of the staff (wish I knew names) make you feel welcome and appreciated. How do we convince them to do delivery?"
"Came here for my birthday dinner with a few friends and we all agreed that it was one of the best meals any of us has ever enjoyed.  This place is small, so anticipate a long wait, even on a weeknight, but fear not, because Haymarket Brewery is just across the street.   Once you put your name and phone number down, mosey on over that way and enjoy some delicious beer and an appetizer.When your table is ready, relax in one of their plush leather booths and enjoy the beautiful 1920's style ambiance.  Be sure to try a cocktail while you wait for your food.  I had the Hemingway Daiquiri and loved it so much, I might stop in again just for a drink at the bar.I'm sure everything on the menu is great, but my friends and I had been told by numerous foodies that the burgers here are the best in the city, so we had to try them, along with an order of fries for the table.  I promise that you've never had a burger this good.  At one point, as I picked up the burger, I thought the patty was falling, then I realized that it was the bacon sliding off.  The bacon is that thick and juicy that I thought it was a patty!  With every bite I noticed a new flavor and could not get enough.  It was just an added bonus that the fries were so crispy and flavorful.I honestly can not say enough good things about this place and am already looking forward to my next meal there.  Oh, and if you're trying to save money, but still want to enjoy some of Chi's best food, skip the drinks and just enjoy a burger.  Only $12 and worth every penny."
"Good food. The Korean Chicken... yes KOREAN chicken (not general tsao, or whatever they called it) tasted very good and very Korean. Over priced for sure. The bologna burger was good, but overwhelming for me personally. The bacon there was pretty amazing. A bit sweet but nonetheless amazing. Not sure if I'd go again. Getting a seat there is really difficult but for a burger, the wait isn't worth it."
"I don't eat burgers, but the burgers here made my mouth water.  I still didn't have one though.  I had the standard breakfast - eggs, bacon and toast.  The eggs were perfectly cooked and absolutely divine.  I know they're just scrambled eggs, but I honestly don't think I've ever had better eggs in my life.  The bacon was also delicious.  Thick cut, just the way I like it.  The only sad thing about the breakfast is I would have preferred hash browns or some sort of potato instead of boring old toast.  The service was good, the drinks were good too.  Ambiance was cute and rustic.  We sat at the counter, and it was fun to watch the chefs work.  Definitely a cute date spot.  But, to note...they get crowded, so you may have to wait.  They take your cell number, so it's easy to go next door to the Lone Wolf for a drink while you wait."
"This place was exceptional. I enjoyed the double egg burger. It was cooked with care and the those on the line seemed focused. The music was alright, but the atmosphere seemed friendly. I recommend their mash potatoes too. Apart from the food being exceptional, the only problem I had was the feeling of being rushed. My father and I dined in when they opened, which was already packed. The server seemed distracted. All in all a good experience."
"Absolutely fantastic burger place right near downtown Chicago.  Be forewarned - coming here will put you in a coma that you won't be able to shake for the rest of the day.  The food is that rich and that good.  Their 'single' is actually two meat patties.  That's unbelievably awesome.  Combo that with their unbelievably rich fries and a drink and you're good to go.Note that this place is rather small though, so even if there's not a huge line of people waiting in front of you, chances are you'll have a while before you get seated and get your food.  The lunchtime wait for this place was about 45 minutes for a table of 4, which is about par with some of the more famous Chicago eateries.  If you don't want to wait, then you'll basically need to stave off hunger until around 1:30 or so when tables start opening up."
"Yes, the burgers are good. Yes, the fries are good. Am I going to wait 3 hours for a table or stalk people at the bar like a vulture hoping they keel over and have a heart attack so I can have their seat? Maybe. Honestly, the later you go the easier time you'll have finding a seat - especially on Monday or Tuesday nights."
"OMG. I'm in love with this place. I have dreams about the burger with egg and bacon! The bone marrow appetizer with beef cheek marmalade on toast was a great start to the meal. As stated before, the burger was AMAZING and the fries with sauce complimented it well. My boyfriend had the fried bologna, which they said is made in house, and said it was the best he's had. The place has a great vibe and a really helpful and cheery staff. Don't forget to save room for dessert!"
"Sweet mother of crom their burgers are good. Put your name in, then head down the street, it's usually slammed (grab a whiskey from Lone Wolf). Top sides: fries, browns and Mac. Worth the wait. Great bleeders too."
So good. Order the bone marrow. I was concerned about the sound of it but was happily surprised. The burgers are amazing also and the beer selection if fun to venture into! The staff is super friendly and attentive.
"The first time I came to Au Cheval, I thoroughly enjoyed an assortment of fatty foie dishes. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy the burger. I recently came back to try the single cheeseburger without bacon and egg and it was SO GOOD! I can honestly say it's the best burger and fries I've ever had. EVER. So good that I came back the next day for another burger and fries. So good that I'm craving more while I sit and write my review.."
I love au cheval. I come often and love the food every time. Usually it's for dinner but today I had lunch. What a disappointment. The service was terrible. Sides came first and my sisters food came out at least ten minutes before mine. My table was never bussed and I had to get up to give the server my credit card so we could leave. I'm so used to the excellent service this was a disappointment.
"If there was a mantra going through my head during the Bucktown 5k, it definitely included the words Au Cheval and double cheeseburger!We arrived 15 minutes after opening on a Sunday and were quoted an hour wait time, though it was halved in actuality.  Having read many great things about the doub cheeseburger, I, of course, had to check out what all the fuss was about.  Oh my, that is definitely a killer burger!  Juicy meat, oozy cheese, bun that holds up to aforementioned meat x2... can I get a booyah all around? Love the french press coffee, and those are some legit hash browns and fries too. I would recommend it, though it was not the best burger I've ever eaten."
"I had their double cheese burger without the fried egg, to be honest I have been on burger journey for the past few months in Chicago, and I must say when you have eaten at so many great burger joints you start to make comparisons. For me the burger was OK nothing out of this world, but that doesn't mean its not a bad burger, its just that its not great. I have found Kuma or even scratch burger to offer a better burger experience. I hope they could include a bit more flavors in their burger options and i know I am wishing too much over here but for the price of burger they charge it wouldn't hurt to throw in a side of fries."
"Their Cheeseburger and Blueberry Muffin are glorious.  The first time you had a cheeseburger as a kid and you smiled, this is how you feel after eating one. The Blueberry Muffin tastes the way a blueberry muffin should taste. The Bologna sandwich is ok, tastes more like a deli ham sandwich.  My dad made fried bologna sandwiches growing up and I expected something like one of those except 10 times better."
I was referred to this place for their burgers. It was indeed the best burger I have ever had. Ever. You will not be disappointed. The atmosphere is great too. I will absolutely be back here!
Had the cheeseburger and the chicken liver toast. Both were excellent. Beers and cocktails were also good with a nice selection.
"I've been wanting to try this place pretty much since it's opened but the wait is always unbearable when I'm hungry. Last night, I couldn't resist. Waited an hour to get in (went to Maude's to drink in the meantime) but when I tell you the wait was more than worth it. Ordered the single burger with cheddar, bacon and an egg. The burger was just incredible. I hope no one takes this the wrong way, but it was a super classy and sophisticated mix of a Wendy's Baconator and a Steak n Shake burger. Let me explain. It was crispy on the edges like SnS and they toasted the bun. The bacon made it very reminiscent of a Baconator but it was oh so much more than that. The bacon was about an inch thick and was just heavenly. We also ordered fries. The real star of the show was the garlic aioli for those. I was full but couldn't stop eating bc it was so good. Overall, I loved it. I will most certainly be back. Keep up the great work over there!"
"Though the burgers are great, everything else on the menu is unbelievably delicious! And the texas toast that gets served with their breakfast items is too good as well."
"What's to say that hasn't been said about the burger and fries? Love that the burger comes the way it does, no choices on cheese or toppings, just order it and enjoy. Helpful hint that the ""single"" cheeseburger is really 2 patties. Also enjoyed the chopped chicken liver. We went around 7pm on a Sunday and waited about 30 minutes. It is nice that they text you when your table is ready so you can grab a beer at one of the other West Loop bars!"
"I was excited to hear that this restaurant was open for Memorial Day unlike most of the nice restaurants in the area. My boyfriend and I reached at 4:30 and were seated right away, although the kitchen is closed from 3-5 PM we were able to order cocktails in the meantime. I ordered their version of Daiquiri and it was extremely refreshing. We ordered the double cheeseburger with bacon (we omitted the egg), the raw vegetable salad with apple and blue cheese and the salmon. The cheeseburger was AMAZING. The cheese and beef were delicious and it melted in our mouths. We have never had a cheeseburger quite like it... it was exquisite. It was monumental."
"[Out-of-towner Review]When someone tells you go to the place where they've had the best burger in that city, do you listen?I sure as hell did, especially when said advice is coming from a trained professional chef! That being said, being in town for the IFT tradeshow, I was in need of a great dinner spot. As my inner-fat-kid would have it, we taxied over to Au Cheval for the elusive burg.Funny, this little corner spot reminds me of something straight out of SF - the vibe, the décor, the menu, everything. I'm totally okay with that, but to go to the MW only to find something so similar to my West Coast eateries was interesting.Space is limited so reservations are suggested. I was also told that if it was too busy, add your name (and cell phone number) and go drink at the various local bars/eateries while you wait. Luckily for us we didn't have to wait, we were seated immediately. The menu is small in items, large in size. I had fun pretending to decide what I was going to have, when in reality we all know I was there for the burg. But do I add bacon or make it a double? Being on the conservative side I added bacon and kept it a single. Literally, out came a perfect burger. There should have been theme music playing...what song would match such an occasion is still questionable. It was definitely an ah-ha moment when that bad boy was set down at my table. The bun was perfectly toasted; the cheddar cheese was oozing off the double patties. There were two patties for the single portion; the flavor of the beef is what makes this burger over the top - something special, not sure what it is but its ahhhh-mazing! Simple in nature, they add pickles (gross, removed immediately) and finely diced red onions (think McD's, by no means is this a comparison). I believe they offer an aioli on this, but I think I asked for it on the side. Bacon or bacon, this isn't your average bacon. These were to stripes of the thickets, juiciest, tastiest bacon delicacies I've consumed. They were huge in flavor and portion, needless to say - the culmination of these attributes makes this one of the BEST burgers I've ever had.We did order a salad to start and adult beverages, both of which were great. But my love for the burg leaves me lacking the wit or knack to expand upon them.I was able to shovel down one scoop of chocolate gelato, post burger coma, and it was light and delicious. It was simple, but a perfect way to sedate me for my ride home.Their burger was a game changer...you're welcome!"
"You must get the burger. I don't even like burgers and this burger is SO good (with the bacon, obviously). They have a good beer menu that I believe changes with the season. The place isn't very big and they don't take reservations, so I recommend getting there early or just be prepared to wait (grab a yummy drink at Lone Wolf)!"
"Mixed feelings on this place. It's definitely a ""cool"" place to be/eat/drink and the food is pretty tasty, but it's small, dark, and cramped if that's your thing.Everyone raves about the burger, but for me it's a little too greasy. For sure it's a solid offering and better than 80% of the burgers at other restaurants, but it lacked the ""wow"" factor for me even with the fried egg on top (to quote Anthony Bourdain ""I'm a total egg slut""). Crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy was rich and full bodied with flavor, however it's pretty heavy so don't expect to do a heavy workout after consuming. Staff is good, bar tenders were nice, just be prepared to wait if you come on a busy night. Decent place overall and solid option on Randolph."
"Small place, plan on waiting for a table and have a cocktail.   Drinks were great. Order a burger and call it a day!!"
"Believe all the hype! Burger with egg and bacon- exceptional , chili con carne- perfect, pumpkin smasher ale to wash it all down???? It's been 3 weeks and I'm still thinking about one of the best meals I've ever had. Go early and prepare to wait, don't be afraid to sit at the bar, it faces the kitchen and you really feel like a part of the action. Must try in Chicago"
I was skeptical. I was WRONG to be skeptical. This was the best burger I've ever had in my entire life. Get the burger with the single patty and add an egg and order hashbrowns. If you want bacon; put it on the side. It is delicious but it has no business adulterating that heavenly patty. Trust me on this.Grab a drink and prepare to wait. We waited about one hour and 15 minutes on a Wednesday night after arriving at 6 PM. Beyond worth it and I plan to wait again ASAP!
"This is truly a tale of a two sided experience.  While suffering this morning from a post Super Bowl hangover I took a few of our younger colleagues to Au Cheval for some sustenance to help us salvage the day.  We went a little crazy on appetizers:Bone marrow:  excellent...a must getFoie Gras terrine:  OK, needs a better service vesselLiver:  pretty good with the toastChili dish:  I had enough at the Super Bowl party and didn't even want to try itWe all had burgers for our lunch.  This is a very good burger.  I would put it up against anyone else in town.  Pickles and hash browns were nice sides.I didn't really care for the clientele as it seemed to be a little on the hipster side, but when you want to connect with your younger associates you must go where they feel comfortable."
"Yes, it's a pain to get a table or even a seat at the bar.  Yes, it's a little pricey.  That being said, it's worth the wait and every penny!  Do yourself a favor, go with plenty of time.  Get your name on the list and go next door to Floyd's and have a beer or two.  Then enjoy probably the best burger I've every had (better than Kuma's or Burger Bar or Capital Grille).  It's hard to describe what makes it so great.  Meat is delicious, the cheese is perfectly tangy, the pickles are a nice touch, the ratio of bun to meet is ideal.  All in all, a really really good burger.  Fries are great, chicken liver is awesome, hash browns are ridiculous -- not sure what else to say."
"One of the best, if not THE best hamburger in the city. Great vibe, good people."
"Excellent burger, extensive beer list, and great service.  Yes, the crowds are ridiculous, but don't hate the player.  I went for lunch and was seated in 20 minutes.  They text you when your table is ready, so just go across the street to Haymarket and have a drink.  If you're too hungry to wait, then have your entire meal at Haymarket and try Au Cheval some other time."
"I had pretty high expectations going here and I would say they were mostly met.  We had to wait a bit to be seated, even during the week, but to be expected.  The burger was amazing, of course, but my main hang up was with the fries.  When I tried them I thought they tasted strange, but couldn't figure out why.  I later found out they were duck fat fries, but from what I can remember it didn't specify that on the menu or I wouldn't have ordered them.  I know some people love them but I'm not a fan and would have liked to know what I was getting before ordering."
"Can't even comment on the food as I was told I had to stand next to the host station along with 20 of my new best friends. No light, and no room to even read the menu!  The host was rude when I asked if I could step over to bar to see the menu, sooo with 20 other restaurants within a block, I bailed out.  Heard it was good, so maybe another time, maybe???Another ""A table for one"" review."
"worth it, every minute of the wait, believe the hype"
Eat their burger. Get ready for a salt attack but on my momma you will not regret this treat. I'm due for a trip very soon!
"Ooooomg.  I honestly feel like I gain at least 5 lbs after eating here. First of all the atmosphere is great, dim lighting and great open kitchen! The bone marrow is divine and my very first time wanting to actually try it.  The burgers and fries are a must and even their matzo ball soup is too legit to quit.  They are open late night which is great for my fellow industry people who don't get out till past 10pm. I love this place,  if you haven't tried it,  you must... Right now they are still open."
Died and went to burger heaven. Few things to keep in mind... 1. Wait is long but worth it. 2. Single is really a double. 3. Garlic aioli that comes with the fries is delicious but you will definitely need a mint/gum after it. Come prepared. You've been warned.
"I won't use the yelp to complain or bad mouth a place.My issues are just that, issues and they won't keep me from coming back.The 4 star rating is my opinion.Based on my first visit of many to come.The burger is legit.I've read and heard the hype. Fukc the hype and if you eat meat, order it hot and stick it in your mouth and make moist crotch making noises. Fap fap fap fapSimple.If you want to release some anger aimed at your workouts and trainers, order the bologna sandwich.Fkc yeah its quite tasty and as unhealthy as things that taste this way should.The 50 or so taps which line the left side of the bar give most beer snobs a tug on their weenises...along with some cool whiskey and pickle juice shot combos.Cheap tall boys too? why yes, not the dancing on stripper pole kind, but the beers.The mixology list (that's COCKtails for others) look tasty and what I did stick my tongue into was refreshing and made my 21st digit move.The music and ambience was chill, yet on edge with people who looked like they knew what they wanted, or where to be and this was one of those spots for the moment.The bathroom was large enough for a 3some and a bathroom attendant to hold all of the drinks while things got rocking.and that's it for now.and if you notice something I'm not talking about, kudos to you for reading into what was not written and complained about.peace."
"Au Cheval is definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago. Some of my favs include: ANYTHING WITH A FRIED EGG ON TOP.The burger, the fries with garlic aioli, the roasted bone marrow, Jane's fried chicken to name a few....If you go for brunch I would definitely recommend the crispy potato hash with duck hearts gravy.They don't take reservations and the wait easily reaches 2 hours- It's also probably best not to go there with more than 4-5 people. I like just going with one other person and sitting at the bar to watch them cook :DWhat I usually do is put my name in for a table and give them my phone number, then I run over to haymarket brewery across the street for a beer. They send you a text when your table is almost ready, giving you enough time to close your drink tab and walk back over.Tip: when you order the burger, the single has 2 patties, and the double has 3 :)extra points if you slather on some of the garlic aioli from the fries!"
"Au Cheval doesn't need my positive review to stay in business judging from the wait time to get a table, but I was impressed by its quality and value.  I would give it 5 stars but it loses a star because unless you eat at an unusual time of day, you will have to wait a while to be seated.  Time = money.My fellow patrons and I shared some hamburgers and General Jane's chicken.  The chicken was a perfect blend of hot and sweet, although I have been told by others that I have a low tolerance for heat in food.  Our fries were nice and crisp.  If you're going for the first time, get the burger.  It lives up to the hype.I will be dining again at Au Cheval."
The best burger in Chi-town!  Make sure to get your burger with bacon.  The burgers are large so keep that in mind when ordering sides.  No great burger is complete without fries....I love the mayo they serve with the fries.  Expect to wait in line but the wait is well worth it:)
"Seriously the best thing I've ever eaten. Ordered the single cheeseburger (which comes with 2 patties). Got everything on it, including thick-cut bacon, pickles, cheese fondue sauce and egg. It was so tasty and makes me want to move to Chicago just so I can eat it all the time. Only downside of the restaurant was that they don't take reservations. We were prepared for a long wait and got some drinks across the street at Girl & The Goat. Estimated wait time was 2-2.5 hours, but we were seated within 1.5. Overall, had an amazing experience and recommend it to everyone."
"This is my only 5 star review. I would knock one down for the insane wait, but the food made it worth it. I had the double cheeseburger with fried egg and bacon and it was by wide and far THE best burger I have ever had in my life. There are plenty of places that add different things such as avocados, pineapples, and the whole gamut of different toppings to burgers, but for a no frills burger experience, this is the place.The bacon was cut very thick, a bit over 1/4 of an inch thick and slightly sweet. Not crispy, just right. The egg was sunny side up and just right. The double burger came with 3 patties, while the single came with 2. I should have gone with the single, as this beast was hard to get a bite of everything in a single bite.About the wait, the kitchen is closed from 3-5pm so with that in mind, if you show up at 5, you're going to wait an hour. They do have a great bar that alone would rate 4-5 stars, but in either case be prepared to wait. If you don't want to wait long, don't go in the weekend. Definitely don't go in the weekend if you're in a large group, unless you're prepared to have over two hour break. The good thing is that they take your phone number and call you when the table is ready, so you can venture out and do other things while you wait.In sum, this was the best burger I have ever had and I highly recommend it."
Went here to try the infamous burger with a bacon and an egg. I will say I am not disappointed at all. The burger would be up there with top 5 on my list.Tried some whiskey shots with homemade pickle juice (they make it there) as a chaser and it was very tasty. Be prepared to get there early as the venue is small and the wait can be up to two hours
"The best a man can get... The bone marrow is the best dish in the world. I mean, when the dish comes out I feel like the whole world stands still and it's just me and the bone marrow."
"One of the greatest burgers I've ever had! I am always a fan of fried egg, but this one took it to the next level. The bacon was also so thick and delicious. We started off with the bone marrow appetizer. I was super intimidated at first because they are NOT messing around. We got four large bones, and stacks of toast. The jam you get with the toast was probably the best part for me! We then ordered two orders of fries, one with and one without egg. I surprisingly preferred the no egg version because I found the eggs to make it a little too soggy. Needless to say, after all of this in addition to my huge burger, I had left overs! The place is small, and I mean small. Probably only 15 tables total and some space at the bar. We had to wait about 2 hours to be seated, which was okay with me due to the plethora of bar options in the West Loop area. Our waitress was very helpful and nice, as well!"
"When I arrived at 5:30 the place was already starting to fill up and when we left it was packed!  My friend and I ordered the following:Raw Vegetable Salad, Apple and Blue Cheese - This was amazing! It was so refreshing and had a bit of tartness to it that was balanced with the apple and blue cheese. I want to make this at home.Single Cheeseburger with Fried Egg - It was good. Now it wasn't mind-blowing, scream out loud and wave your arms in the air good, but it was good.  The cost was very reasonable for West Loop and I will be back to try more items."
"This place needs a server training intervention. I've been here 3 times now, and each time have been treated so poorly it's laughable. There have even been moments where I have apologized to the server about ordering another drink, asking for silverware, etc. because they make it so blatantly obvious they hate their job.Two stars because the burgers are amazing, but come on - get an attitude adjustment or learn how to hire competent, kind people."
"My Au Cheval Burger Review: Not much that can be said about the Au Cheval burger that hasn't already been said - but as a burger enthusiast who is will to travel out of State to get a burger, let me tell you that I've been thinking long and hard about whether or not I've had a better burger than the one here and I don't think that I have.Every single detail of this burger is relative perfection: A perfectly-textured/lightly toasted bun, perfectly-melted cheddar, a bit of dijon mayonnaise, flavorful beef patties cooked just right... even the pickle - which I found myself removing and even marveling at visually. I couldn't believe how freshly pickled this particular pickle tasted, if you can imagine a pickle leaving such an impression. Also added the fried egg and bacon for good measure.Opinions on burgers vary greatly; some prefer enormous, 1LB-or-more grilled patties with exotic toppings piled to the sky - others enjoy a good greasy fried burger. I enjoy all types, and the Au Cheval burger is definitely one of the latter. In my opinion, fried, greasy cheeseburgers should be enjoyed as plainly as possible but the added seasoned egg & thick-cut bacon (with INCREDIBLE glaze/seasoning) compliment this burger's overall simplicity in an exceptional way. Best burger in Chicago? I am probably not qualified to say based on the places I've been - but I've been to more than a handful and I can believe easily that Au Cheval is ""The One"". Note: if you'd like the bacon and egg added on, you'll need to request it at an additional cost. The standard ""single"" comes with two patties, cheese, pickles, and a mild dijonnaise (which is excellent.)Also - Yes, you will have to wait. Went during the end of Sunday brunch and was told 45-60 minutes, waited about 20. Well worth it.  Planning to bring a big party to this smaller corner-spot during peak hours is probably a recipe for disaster if you want to eat quickly, though. Unlike chain burrito joints, the extended wait time here is more than justified."
"It's a long wait and it's loud. It's pretty close quarters if you're sitting at the bar. I had a great time watching the food getting cooked, they were having a great time behind the counter. I was sitting next to where the server was preparing the plates, I decided to let it roll and be a good sport when I watched the guy manhandle my pickles. He took all 10 fingers and smushed the pickles into the dish then handed it to me. I had the burger with bacon and fries with aioli. It was pretty good but super salty. I got about 1/4 of the way through the burger before I had to quit. If someone brought me here I wouldn't complain but I don't think I'd come back for me."
"I was here after a business meeting in October. Good heavens - the fries are heavenly; the burger (with the fried egg topping) is far too large to stick in your mouth. But you try hard anyway :p-). They have a great selection of beers. And the service, even at the bar, is fantastic. Prepare to wait a long time to get in here. I was lucky to come on a weekday about 11.30 and get a seat. You will not be. (Oh, and fantastic ambience too). Treat yourself to everything on the menu and stagger out. It's worth it."
"This isn't a review on the food but the place.  We came in at 1:00 with zero line.  the host never looked up and informed us that he can't seat us because the kitchen closes at 3:00.  there were numerous tables and spots at the counter.  when I asked about these, i was told that there was a 90 minute wait-list and the people on the wait-list have been texted.  apparently, they wander around town until they receive a text?  i politely asked (really, i was polite) how it works so we can get on the list and get a burger.  the host rudely responded that he already stated that there will be no availability until tonight and I can come back then.  it worked out well as we hopped on a divvy (1/2 block down) and went to butcher and beef burgers (wonderful).  there are two other places on the same block we should have tried.  i do not care how amazing a burger is, if the host is rude as this guy was, i will never eat there.  On a side note, I think I saw the reviewer (David J) there as they were the couple behind us."
"Wonderful cheeseburger.  With bacon--a wonderful bacon.Fried bologna sandwich good but the cheeseburger was better.  Why did Chicago Magazine make it one of their top 50 sandwiches but ignore J. P. Graziano's down the street?  A Mystery!Host was good, No reservations accepted at this tiny bar/diner.  We stood a few minutes (1:00 on a Saturday). The two seats at bar to sit. Ordered an old-fashioned and immediately a table opened up.  The old-fashioned found me awhile later.  Great selection of beers on tap.  The old-fashioned was excellent--second best one I ever had! (Best was in NYC at Bobby Flay's Cafe American, but that's another story.)  Are those hand cut ice cubes? And they stayed so cold they barely melted into the drink through the meal.  Nice touch Au Cheval :)Fries were good but I would lose the  Mornay sauce. Garlic aoli was good.  Service was okay but a bit frantic and erratic.Come for the drinks and the cheeseburger."
"Yes, the ambiance was nice but all of this talk about how amazing the hamburger is overrated.  If you're looking for the best burger in Chicago don't waste your energy expecting to find it here. Just go straight to RJ Grunts.      Keep in mind this is coming from a girl who's faves are fathers office in LA and minetta tavern in NY."
"""One of the best no-nonsense eateries around.""For some reason, ""no-nonsense"" is the first term that comes to mind when I think of Au Cheval. Having been to Next, The Publican, & other hyped-up restaurants in the area, I was extremely surprised at how low-key and non-fussy the entire dinner experience was (in a very good way - it was refreshing!)So how would you know if Au Cheval is right for you?1) You're craving a burger/good food: My party of three got:the burger (both with and without an added egg),the foie gras,the fried chicken, andthe crispy fries. All very healthy, I know. But, happy to say that not a single calorie was wasted - everything tasted PHENOMENAL. (They also have beer options galore!)2) You don't want to break the bank: most dishes were under $15 (some under $10), and virtually everything was under $203) You want good service: about 15 minutes after we ordered, the waitress came back and told us that due to some kitchen difficulties, the foie gras would be delayed by 20 minutes (i.e. come after our burgers). She then apologized and asked us if we'd rather something else. After we said no, we would wait, she told us that the dish would be on the house. (!!! how surprising ... we didn't even look mad/annoyed/mean!) I rarely get such considerate service from restaurants that are accustomed to lines of people wanting to get in ... so that's definitely a BIG plus in my book.However, as good as Au Cheval is, it isn't necessarily perfect for all occasions.Avoid Au Cheval if:1) You'd like to see/hear your others with relative ease: it was REALLY loud (not surprising, given how many people there were) and REALLY REALLY dark (we had to pull out our phones to read the menus!). While that's helpful if you say something stupid or drop food all over yourself (hey, it happens - especially with really big & greasy, egg-topped burgers), 90% of the time it's just frustrating when you're with soft-spoken friends whom you haven't seen in a while.2) Your friends/date value gorgeous decor/ambiance: it was kind of cramped, and the tables/silverware/etc. are all pretty standard (well, I guess it IS a bar, after all). If you have a special occasion that requires more than the food to be outstanding, I'd probably look for another choice - like I said, this place is no-fuss, no-nonsense!"
"This is a bar/diner type place.  Went due to proximity and yelp rating.Went Easter Sunday, they had a brunch menu. We all ordered cheeeseburgers and 3 of 4 of us wanted either something special on our burger or some tweak to what was ""standard"".  Waitress handled it without batting an eye.  Burgers were outstanding, fries were crisp and delicious, drinks were top notch (Bloody Mary and beer).  Would definitely come back when in Chicago."
"Definitely eat here if you want to shit your pants on the way home. This place was recommended by so many people I trust, I'm shocked at how bad my experience was.I don't care about a long wait, great restaurants in a big city, it happens. Best burger in America?  I've had better burgers at food trucks.Service? Let's talk about how a server slammed down our plates and walked off as she said ""there ya go."" Of course without realizing we didn't even have utensils to eat!The fries with the fried egg were good, but fries with garlic mayo is nothing to right home about.I was already completely over this place, but then on the way home I actually felt sick. So to top off the bad food, bad service Au Cheval gave me a nice ""gift bag"" on my way home."
"When my friend first told me about Au Cheval and how it has the best burger in Chicago, I was skeptical.  It's a big statement to make, and I wasn't sure if it could live up to the hype.  It did.  I've been there numerous times over the last 6 months, and I love everything about Au Cheval (but especially the burger).  I make it a point to bring anyone/everyone who hasn't eaten there.  I love everything about it - the staff, the vibe, and the FOOD.  General Jane's chicken is amazing, as is the bone marrow.  The garlic aioli that comes with the fires is so delicious.  I've never ordered the salad, but I did see it one day, and even that looks amazing.  I don't particularly love the wait times, but there are plenty of good bars right nearby where you can hang out and chill.   And as long as you come prepared to wait, you'll be fine.And if you're planning to go this weekend, let me know and I'll come with you!"
"We'd tried to come here a couple of times before but the wait was always too long for the other stuff we were doing.  Boo to that.  So this most recent trip, we showed up before they even opened.  I was not really surprised that there was already a line when we got there.First, if you are a large group, you may get split up or you might get wedged into a booth.  This is probably not a great place to bring a whole bunch of people.  4 is pushing it.We got seated right away, which was nice.  Got menus, got some drinks ordered, and then heard a bit about the menu from our server while we waited for the final member of our party to arrive.  It took a bit for our stuff to come out but it was pretty busy and getting more crowded by the moment. After we ordered, our sides came out before our actual food, so the timing was a smidge off.In terms of the food, itself, we had the chicken with a sweet and spicy sauce of goodness on it.  Folks kept trying to clear the leftover sauce from the table but I needed it for my french fries.  It was kind of delicious.  The french fries?  Forget about it - they were phenomenal and amazing, even just with nothing on them.  Perfect crispy and yet soft on the inside fries.  We also rather enjoyed the bread and butter pickles - normally I like the sour, dill, garlic ones but these were yummy.  And then.  Most of us at the table ordered the fried bologna sandwich.  Because you should always have that when it is on a menu.  It was not what I expected - shaved bologna on a huge bun with cheesy sauce.  A bit salty, perhaps, but quite shockingly good, in my opinion.  They appear to have a wide beverage selection - as we were preparing for a day of being outside in the heat, thought it best to not start overindulging too early, but I would come back and check out their beer selection because they had a lot of goodies to choose from.So in summary, this is not your average diner - get there early or you're going to have to wait, and eat some fried bologna and be happy about it, ok?"
"We came here based on a recommendation of Au Cheval having one of our foodie friend's title for the 2nd best burger he's had. Since we found our way to the Harpo Studios sign (we're tourists!) and this was nearby, we had to try it. We fortunately caught a table a little before the kitchen closed for the break before dinner and was able to sneak in our orders.Thank goodness my friend told us beforehand that a single cheeseburger is actually two patties because those burgers were massive--especially if you add the thick pieces of bacon and a fried egg. Two people in my group had both the bacon and egg added to their cheeseburgers. I had only the fried egg added to my burger because I don't feel like I need bacon on everything. I'm not a big fan of burgers, but I will say that was probably the best least complicated cheeseburger i've ever had because the patty was juicy, had flavor, freshly made and cooked and the bun and egg just amplified the patty that melted in your mouth. Soo good that this is probably the best burger I've had (disclaimer, not a burger enthusiast haha). Someone else in our group had the Toasted Open-Faced Ham & Cheese Fondue and that was surprisingly delicious as well!The place also had a cool vibe and great music!"
"Was scared we would have to wait forever for our table Sunday afternoon but were seated within 5 mins so yaaaaay. I was feeling a lil under the weather and almost didn't order the burger. Good lord I am so so glad I did. It truly was one of the best burgers I have had in Chicago. The best. If u get a single, you could easily finish it yourself. I split one w the hubs and we both wished we had ordered our own lol next time. Our server was great too. Loved the diner vibe there and can't wait to come back!"
"A scene from Pulp Fiction (revised script)...    Jules Winnfield: Looks like Vincent and I caught you boys at breakfast. Sorry about that. Whatcha havin'?    Brett: Hamburgers.    Jules Winnfield: Hamburgers! The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast! What kind of hamburgers?    Brett: Ch-cheeseburgers.    Jules Winnfield: No, no, no, Where'd you get 'em? McDonald's? Wendy's? Jack in the Box? Where?    Brett: Au Cheval.    Jules Winnfield: Au Cheval? That's that gastropub that has a long wait and takes no reservations. I hear they got some tasty burgers! I ain't never had one myself. How are they?    Brett: They're good. Some would say they're better than Kuma's. I ordered mine with a fried egg and bacon. The bacon alone is amazing.    Jules Winnfield: Mind if I try one of yours? [Brett nods] This is yours here, right? [picks up burger and takes a bite] Mmm-mmmm. This is a tasty burger! Vincent, ever have an Au Cheval Burger? [Vincent shakes his head] Wanna bite? They're real tasty!        Vincent Vega: I ain't hungry.   Jules Winnfield: Well, if you like hamburgers, give 'em a try sometime."
"I have such mixed feelings about this restaurant.  The service was good.  The food was good (app- fried chicken, entree- burger with bacon and fried egg and French fries).  The drinks were good (Hemingway daiquiri).  The dessert was awful, like seriously the worst dessert I've ever had in a restaurant awful.  I don't know what would possess these otherwise gifted people to charge $12 for burnt, flavorless puff pastry with pastry cream.  Hello?  A twelve year old could make that (and not burn it).  What further annoyed me is that when our waiter asked how we liked it and we said we didn't we were still charged for it and no one discussed it with us any further.  Anyways, after paying the bill at the end of my meal it left a had taste in my mouth.  Literally.  Would I go back?  Uhh... I don't know, if I do I DEFINITELY will NOT get dessert."
"I ordered the fried house-made bologna sandwich -- it was the perfect combination of meat and cheddar cheese, and the buns were excellent too. I sampled the famous cheeseburger, and everyone else at my table loved it! We also shared (and loved) the crispy fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli, and fried farm egg (garlic aioli better than the mornay sauce, but both are delicious with the fries). We loved every bit of this dish, we just wished there were more fries, since there was quite a bit of sauce left over. But the near-unanimous favorite was the crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy -- never knew hashbrowns could be so good! I know Au Cheval is famous for their foie gras, but you gotta try the fries or the potato hash. All this, and each of the five of us spent less than $20.So I'd give Au Cheval 5 stars for the food and reasonable prices (esp. if you get a burger or a sandwich -- the foie gras looked too pricey for me). Why am I docking this to a 4 stars? I came here on a Thursday night at 5:30pm, knowing that the restaurant was small and the wait was notoriously long. I put my name down for a party of 5, and I was told that we'd get a 30 minute wait. I did come back at 6pm to ask how much time left, and I was told 30-45 minutes more (can you believe it?). Came back at 6:15pm, then at 6:30pm and was told that there was 1 party ahead of me and that I'd be seated soon. We got seated at 7:05pm.I didn't mind the 1.5 hour waiting, even though I thought I got there relatively early (5:30pm) for a Thursday evening -- this place is incredibly popular, and it's a pretty small diner. What I didn't like was the poor estimation of the amount of waiting time left, and how impatient the lady was with me. Really, all I asked was, ""Hi, I'm just wondering how much longer our wait was?"" as politely as I possibly could, albeit, I asked that question every 15-20 minutes, but I was really starting to get annoyed when I was 1 hour into the wait and not feeling very accommodated for.Anyway, enough with the venting, because once the food came out, all was forgiven. I'm not sure when I'll be back because of the long wait, but I will definitely recommend this place to coworkers and friends."
"Hands down the best burger in Chicago. Add the fried egg and bacon. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!"
"This place is awesome and is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Every time that I have friends/family come in town this is the first place that I always think to take them. Unfortunately, a lot of people probably think the same, and with a small physical plant, the wait in the evening can be upwards of 3 hours."
"Really impressed with this place, the cheeseburger is one of the best I've ever had, so thick and juicy. And then the bolognese is just as good, normally I wouldn't get a bolognese sandwich but this one is so worth getting. Fries were good too, and not that expensive given the area"
"Wow!  What a great burger.  It's so dense and compact.  When you bite into it, it isn't sloppy and doesn't fall apart, which I really like.  It keeps it's shape throughout the entire meal.  Sitting at the bar is great because the chefs make everything right in front of you.  Amazing dining experience.  Probably the best burger in Chicago, rivals Kumas Corner and Lockdown. The only negatives are that the restaurant is a very small compact space so it's very crowded and your always bumping elbows with everyone.  And I don't really like the fries.  They are too hard and crispy. Overall I give this place a A-.  Highly recommended."
"I did not enjoy this place.  We went on a really rainy night so it was understandably crowded inside in the waiting area near the bar.  We moved down to the other end of the bar and the waitress rudely told us we weren't allowed to stand there.  Ok... no problem.  So, we move back to the front area.  She ended up also being our waitress incidentally and didn't refill our water glasses the entire time.  The food itself was super salty.  We ordered the cheeseburger with bacon that everyone raves about and I could feel my arteries clogging.  The fries that we ordered on the side were also waaaay too salty.  There are so many positive reviews so I am not sure if we just went on an off night or if we prefer to eat a little too healthy for this place... but I really didn't get what was supposed to be so great."
Best burger i've ever had. Even better than my Dad's and he's really good at cooking burgers.
"The burger is pricey but it is the best burger you will ever eat. Quality right? Personally, I like this joint better than Unami. It is definitely the best burger. I wish they have reservations though...because the line is sooooo long! Come early! Your taste buds will not be disappointed."
Came here yesterday with my bestie!! We both had the single burger I had bacon and egg added to mine. It was so juicy and unbelievably good!! def worth a try. friendly staff and good food.
"THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. My girlfriends and I came here for dinner on a busy saturday night and were stuck waiting in the hall for a table. When I turned to ask the cute guy seated next to me how long he waited for a table, the waitress grabbed my arm and pushed me away telling me I was ""not allowed to talk to customers"" You've GOT to be joking. Will never come back."
"I'm just gonna start off by saying Jane's honey-fried chicken with chili sesame seeds and cilantro is some serious shit! You get 2 legs, 2 wings and 2 thighs with this meal and the sauce is nothing short of amazing. I seriously did the damn thang on those wings. I knew I was going to get it as soon as I saw some table order it and the smell smacked the hell out of my nose, in a good way lol. We had a group of 5 so we squeezed into the booth. We waited quite a while as our whole group hadn't showed up yet and we watched seat after seat get taken even though more than half of our group was there...we understood the rules though. I had three beer while waiting: sunner keller, a golden German ale that was pretty good along with two others that I cant remember the name of, but they were really good and high in alcohol content. By the time we sat down, I was pretty buzzed and those wings hit the damn spot along with some delicious fries that came with a fried egg on top. The burger that my friend got looked pretty delicious, so that will be next on my list.I came back much later and tried the burger and it was as good as everyone says it is. I got the single which is really a double. I got fries with it and I must have caught them on a bad day as it just tasted like grease in the form of a fry. Place was pretty crowded for lunch as everyone was vying for that coveted burger."
The service was great!  We started with a few beers after arriving But omg the burgers were delicious. I had the single cheeseburger with the fried egg and my bf got the same but with bacon. The fries and dip was good too. Definitely coming back.
What can be said that hasn't already been said?  Their burger is an experience.
"A true Chicago treasure. Will you wait up to an hour? Yes. Can you put your name in and go anywhere else during that hour? Yes. Will you still sometimes wait 20+ minutes after they claim your table is next? Yes. However, blame the people sitting around at the table instead of the staff. The staff is also excellent. Just really, really cool people. Need something to pass the time? Check out the people living above the bar across the street as an insider tip. The food really is worth it as any man will tell you they have the best burgers in Chicago. This is probably due to the single actually being a double and the double really being a triple. Fried chicken is also delicious and do not miss out on the veggie salad, it's divine. Put a fried egg on everything too in case they haven't already. The reason I love it so much is because of the environment and the constant sound of beef patties and bologna sizzling on the griddles. They also give you a ketchup bottle instead of those annoying tin cups. I've had the easiest time getting a table on Sunday's around 6pm but you just never know. Swing by the Lone Wolf while you wait, it's awesome."
"Au Cheval has quickly become my go-to restaurant in Chicago. Why?1. Atmosphere. It's just cool in here. Low lighting, wood, killer music. Is it a diner, a hipster cocktail/craft beer bar, or an upscale restaurant? It's all of those things. 2. Food. This should be #1 on the list, but I didn't write it that way, sorry. The food here is stupid good. Their burger is famous for a reason. It's simple and amazing. Beef, cheese, good bun, topped with a fried egg and half-inch thick slabs of bacon if you're not a chump. Last time I went I had the General Jane's fried chicken. It's korean-style, fried twice, and delicious. It was so crispy, just spicy enough, and ridiculously messy. Their fries are amazing, too. Get the big order with a fried egg on top and garlic aioli. They serve fois gras, terrine, and marrow bones and a bunch of other upscale treats alongside burgers, fries, and scrambled eggs. THIS IS THE PERFECT RESTAURANT.3. Drinks. Their cocktails are impressive. They're into the vintage cocktail thing, which is the only way to go in my opinion. They like using small-batch liquors and their bartenders know how to do things right. On the non-alcoholic side of things, I would suggest ending your meal with a rootbeer float.4. It's cheap! Yeah, you can spend $70 per person. But you can also spend $15.Go to Au Cheval. Bring money. Gorge yourself."
"Came here for lunch Friday and my friend and I split the single cheeseburger, foie gras terrine with strawberry jam, and crispy fries with an egg on top and some sort of dipping sauces on the side.The foie gras was rich and tasty and the jam cut the taste well when spread on the thick and buttery slices of toast.We added bacon to the burger which was pretty amazing.  The bacon cuts were thick and nicely crisped.  I thought the burger probably would've been just as good without it though.  Definitely the standout of the meal.The crispy fries were just okay.  I mean fries are fries and I really didn't understand the point of the egg on top.  Maybe I'm not sophisticated enough.  Anyway, solid lunch spot, and I'd definitely go back for the burger."
"Best Burgers in Chicago, hands down. The fries are fried perfectly and the garlic aioli is the bomb. Service is a perfect 10."
I live in close proximity to this place and let me tell you everything is amazing. The duck fat fries are a must! Love love love !
"Simply Awesome.  Fries with Mornay.  If you do nothing else get the bacon on your burger.  It's an absolute must have. It is life altering, thick, crusty, peppery and brown sugar sweet.  The burger is cooked medium well and is just the best in the city.  There's no rhyme or reason, perhaps it's the way they brine the pickles and thinly slice them.  Perhaps it's the Dijon mustard.  It's probably the patties themselves, never greasy or fatty cooked medium well and made fresh.   Try the pickle brine  shot...it's strangely amazing"
"I've forgotten how many restaurant industry people recommended Au Cheval to me. Especially the burger. So I had to check this place out. THe Sodikoff empire seems to have a lot of cool retro places in their repertoire. Lots of beer on tap, a long bar area, and booths surrounding the outside walls. We split the burger+bacon, bone marrow with beef cheek marmalade, and has browns. All solid around. The servers gave us some more suggestions for us to eat and we were on our way to stuffing ourselves the rest of the trip. Great way to start off the day with some great eats."
"Cheeseburger au cheval (with an egg on top), please! And I feel so cool doing it too.Some may categorize this place as almost too romantic for its own good, especially with a small group of burly male friends, but it's still one of the places where I wish they'd open one up where I call home. I'd go there constantly.Deliciousness is what matters most, though, and I really believe it's hard to find a better burger elsewhere in Chicago. I was literally quiet the entire time as I savored every last bite.Bonus: they have fantastic restrooms."
"Great restaurant, although I have only had dinner here, so I will speak on that. The food is phenomenal, I went with a rather large group and we all got varying items so I was able to try plenty of options on the menu. I tried the crispy fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli and fried egg on top, the General Jane's honey fried chicken, the burger which we got Au Cheval style so an egg and bacon was on there. I also tried the crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy. All were great, it definitely personifies the idea of high class diner. Definitely delicious and definitely unhealthy! Great beer list, good whiskey list. Stick to those two as the wine list isn't anything to speak of but beer and whiskey fits the food better so it makes sense! Everything was delicious, the only reason I didn't rate it a five was because the waitstaff was a little bit hard to work with. Not outright rude or inefficient, just unfriendly."
"It has taken me 4 or 5 visits and a few months to finally write this review. I am certain the reason you're even reading about Au Cheval on Yelp is because a friend or a coworker told you how fantastic it was, but hearing about it and living it are two very different things.Plan on waiting an hour or two (plenty of bars nearby to wait it out) no matter the day of the week, but know that every minute is worth it. I've had a variety of dishes: General Jane's Honey-Fried Chicken, Matzah Ball Soup, Hash Browns, Smashed Potatoes, Fries with Garlic Aioli, and the best thing I have ever eaten: the burger ""with everything."" I could write a short story about each item, and an entire novel about the burger, but all you need to know is that it is necessary for you to eat here and experience it for yourself.Anytime someone visits us, the first thing on our itinerary is Au Cheval, and we continue to hear about it long after they return home. Cozy (if not a little hipster) atmosphere, strong drinks, great location and unbelievable food. I wouldn't change a thing."
Burger is top 10 in Chicago. Excellent quality. The 5th star is for the millefeuille. It was one of the best I've had in Chicago.
"Went to Au Cheval tonight and had the opportunity to have the raw vegetable salad with blue cheese and the honey fried chicken.   Both were excellent!  You can tell that the kitchen starts with top notch ingridents and the chefs care about the food they serve.  My friends got the double bacon cheese burgers and OMG they looked amazing.  The ""bacon"" was slab of bacon, and they both could not stop raving about them. I can't wait to go back and try other items."
That is a damn fine burger... lunch service was fantastic and quick.tasty!
"This place is one of the top restaurants for all around food for a reason. Their service is great, drinks are great, tons of craft beers on tap, and their food is absolutely over the top awesome. I've visited Au Cheval 5 times in the last 12 months and it is definitely one of best burgers in all of Chicago. Ive been to BopN, Kumas, DMK, etc, but Au Cheval takes the crown. There's nothing quite like there fries served with an egg on top with blue cheese and aioli sauces, the single burger (which actually has two patties), and then the towering piece of pastry Bavarian Cyrene magnificence they serve for dessert. Their fried bologna is out of this world and well as most of the breakfast items I've tried. The only thing I would suggest is ordering a mix and match of everything when going w a group because the burger is incredibly heavy and there are too many other great flavors to enjoy!"
I have heard many great things about this place and have been dying to go and see what all the fuss is about. Place was packed at 10:30pm on a Tuesday night and we waited only about five minutes. Had the cheeseburger with a fried egg and the thickest piece of bacon I have ever seen! The burger was cooked to perfection and was absolutely delicious! Also had the French fries with a fried egg as well and was a pleasant surprise. A must have burger and probably the best in the city!
"Small, crowded, cramped, stuffy if you decide to come here on any given day during lunch hour or after 7.  The smoke from the kitchen is wafting in the air and it slighly burned my eyes.But other than the ambience, the food is absolutely delicious!  A friend and I split their famous burger with an egg on top and crispy potato hash w/ duck heart gravy.  Both were outstanding and portions were generous!  I'd recommend a family style eating and ordering several dishes to share among the table because you definitely want to get a taste of everything!  I'm likely to come back during an off hour like 2 or 3pm so I'm actually able to breathe."
High quality burgers with great sides!
"Delicious and fun, Au Cheval is a win.  It is comfortable but contemporary.  Their foie gras is ridiculous.  Smooth and velvety, covered in sweet jam on perfect bread.  More please.  Their burgers are all the rage, and it was good.  But I'm not sure it was the best i've ever had.  The bologna sandwich was excellent!  So very rich that it was a blessing I only had a bite of a friends.  I love french fries though...and when i tell you that their fries with the egg on top and sauces to dip on the side are the biz, please listen.  THEY ARE THE BIZ.  GET THEM.I work nearby, I will be back, gimme more fries stat."
"This was the first time I came here and I would definitely come back!  Me and my boyfriend went there for Sunday dinner and we had about an hour wait. That was ok though because they take your phone number down and text you when your table is ready. That being said, we went to a nearby place for drinks because Au Cheval was crowded. Once we were seated we got the fries with garlic aioli- YUM!!!! I got a single burger with cheese and an egg and my bf got a double with an egg. We basically didn't speak to each other until we were finished stuffing our face- it was that yummy. Definitely would love to eat this burger again."
"Dishes ordered include:Foie Gras Terrine, Strawberry JamCrispy Potato Hash with Duck Heart Gravy and EggFoie Gras, Scrambled Eggs, ToastSingle CheeseburgerFried House-Made Bologna SandwichHash BrownsMatzah Ball SoupCrispy Fries with Mornay Sauce, Garlic Aioli, Fried Farm EggMille-Feuille...the day after pre-dinner at Bavette's Bar and Boeuf I couldn't resist a visit to another Brendan Sodikoff spot and with a brunch menu that read like some sort of gastronomic greatest hits list of things I love I was rather certain Au Cheval would impress me - little did I realize how much they would surprise the rest of my four-top cramped inside the bright, bustling, and heavily wooded Fulton Market restaurant.Described as an ""American Diner with European flare"" by our lovely young server named Christalena shortly after we were seated I was at first overwhelmed by how much of the menu I wanted to order and soon by how quickly the space filled and the noise level raised yet even once every seat was filled the restaurant never truly reached the level of *Loud* - or at least I never noticed since my attention became largely undivided once the food arrived.  Featuring a first round of rich and creamy foie gras and a sidecar overflowing with strawberries cooked until nearly liquefied plus buttery brioche followed by French style scrambled eggs studded with chunks of seared foie gras and likely a stick of butter plus more brioche it would be a lie if I said my breakfast was anything less than gluttonous and yet at the same time it has taken serious effort not to return for the same thing at least once during subsequent trips to Chicago (a situation remedied by visits to Maude's and Gilt Bar, of course.)Moving past my meal and onto others - I really don't know how I convinced my mother to order the Mortadella Bologna sandwich nor how I conned my sister into selecting hash browns with duck heart gravy but I'm quite delighted that they each took my selection - and even happier to note that I was allowed to have more than a few tastes of each...not to mention my sister's dense matzah ball soup, rife with dill, and the burger once deemed best in the United States by Bon Appetit alongside some seriously hefty French fries topped with a runny egg.Last but not least - not by a long shot - the lightest part of the meal would come as dessert; a picture perfect a la minute Mille-Feuille every bit as good as the ones served at Guy Savoy or L'Arpege in Paris...all without the $1000 airfare, $40+ price tag, and fine dining dress code - it was the best my second favorite dessert in 2012 and the meal itself probably my favorite sub-$100 dining experience of the year."
"Probably the most anticipated meal I have ever had!!  I expected to wait at least an hour so not too bad when there are multiple bars nearby..the atmosphere itself reminds me of What I would see in NYC.  Now after about an hour wait I was seated and of course, I was ordering a burger.  I wish I would've know that a a regular order is a double and a double is really three patties.  Nonetheless, still was excited.  Ordered some sides and had the best hash browns of my entire life!!  So damn good!  The burger itself was quite over hyped, maybe it's the whole bacon they put on the burger, which is more like a piece of ham.  For those that love bacon this is the burger spot for you.  As for the burger, it was good, but not memorable.  Still, the ambiance, hash browns, and pumpkin cider (did I mention the pumpkin cider they have is addicting)."
Glorified mc Donalds tasting burger after a two hour wait....every time I've been here. Do it now! Drink next door (lone wolf)
"Fun place to enjoy a meal with friends. Everyone loves their burger and I thought it is really good, just not my favorite. Although I had to try their fried baloney and cheese. It brought back my upbringing which included an almost daily portion of baloney.  It was actually very good, if you like fried baloney.It was crowded and noisy but that's makes it fun. The staff are nice and work hard. I also liked that they allowed us to leave the bar to get cocktails at a less crowded bar nearby, and texted us when are table was ready.I would recommend this as a very good gastro pub"
"I'll state the obvious, best burger I've had in a while. Might have to wait a while or get really lucky and find a seat at the bar. Do whatever it takes and make sure you order the bacon on it."
"I found this place while doing research for our Chicago trip and thought we'd give it a try. First of all, the place is super tiny and very cute. It almost comes across as an old railway dining car but spruced up with sexy lighting and leather banquettes. The first thing my friends and I noticed was the open kitchen right behind the bar and also the delicious smell emanating from said kitchen. When I approached the host stand, I was told that the wait would be 45 minutes - 1 hour. I said thank you and we decided to get drinks and wait it out. No joke, we had not even gotten our drinks when the super nice host came by and told us our table was ready! I think he must have skipped over some people to get us in (so nice) but I wasn't about to complain. When seated, we asked our server for some recommendations to split for the table. She mentioned the General Jane's honey fried chicken, crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy (with a fried egg on top!), and a single cheeseburger with bacon and egg. Everything kind of came out at random which we didn't mind at all because we were sharing. The fried chicken was delicious, super crispy, sweet & spicy all at the same time. Our server described it as wings but it was more like half a fried chicken which honestly is no cause for complaint. Then the burger came out. Oh my dear sweet baby Jesus; it was to DIE for. I love how they say single and it has TWO patties on it with multiple layers of cheese. The gooey egg and the bacon felt absolutely necessary on this bad boy and we were so happy that we got it. Even with three people, we were getting pretty full at this point which is crazy because we still had the potato hash with gravy on the way. When it came, oohs and ahhs were being exclaimed all over the table. While super rich and decadent, the hash was so enjoyable that we ate most of it despite being super full. Overall the food and service was one of the best experiences we had in Chicago. We asked for the check and were honestly astounded: $63 for three entrees AND three drinks plus tax. This was one of the best bargains we had in the whole city. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, for the quality of food and atmosphere Au Cheval is a deal.After we paid our bill and were leaving, I stopped by the host stand again to thank the gentlemen up front for a great time and also to tell them that I found them based on great Yelp reviews. His response was something along the lines of ""I'm glad that you came in spite of some recent reviews."" I then took the liberty of glancing at them when I got home and couldn't help but wonder why people didn't enjoy their time here. The staff were efficient and friendly, the place has a great atmosphere and the food was delicious. My only advice to everyone dining here would be to just be polite, courteous and enjoy yourselves. It's not that difficult! This is a busy restaurant in a city that's known for great food and you probably won't get seated in 10 minutes but I promise you'll enjoy it once you do. It's absolutely worth it!"
"Decided to try the burger with egg on a recommendation. Meh, it was way too salty. I'd rate this burger better than a McDonalds double cheese burger but not as good as a Burger King Whopper; I normally avoid fast food altogether. For $10+ burger, I really wanted to like it. It sucked balls. Salty balls. 5 star service though. Entire staff is incredibly friendly, thus the bump to A-OK."
"Amazing burger, voted one of the best in the country.  It is a super no frills burger, no fancy ingredients here.  I wasnt too happy about the portion size of the $10 fries with the egg on top though.  Kinda wanna try the bone marrow dish next time."
"It's like they know that people will not look attractive eating their food so they made the lighting super dim on purpose.The chicken wings were phenom. Probably the best Korean fried chicken I've ever had, better than Crisp (in Lakeview) or Bonchon. The flavors in the sauce are pretty spot on, and imo, if there isn't a decent sized pool of sauce left in the dish it's not enough (like at Bonchon). This was perfect.The burger was also delicious. Huge. Their single is 8oz. I think they accidentally gave me a double because half way through I looked and definitely saw two patties... oh well.The fries with the egg on top were ok but actually not that great. I had two horse's necks (a rye drink) and my friends had bloody marys, all were delicious. Highly recommended if you're down to pig out and look like a hot mess doing it!"
"The high praise the burger has received is pretty widespread.  Aziz Ansari added this burger to his top 5 list of best burgers in America. That may turn off some peeps who don't find him funny, but yeah he did.  Bon Appetit named it the best new burger in America. I also have to agree. The incorrectly titled double cheeseburger actually has three glorious patties and the pepperwood bacon is so goddamned delicious it made me forget that we were missing RAW to sample this item.  Also don't forget to order some delicious garlic aioli fries with the burger.One time I'm pretty sure they played an entire Roots album while we dined, so yeah, good times.Every time I go it's pretty full.  It was packed for a Monday night. It was packed on a Saturday.  I was told a good time to go is Sunday night, so we went and guess what- it was full.  I'm not surprised due to the quality of the product here.  A small but impressive beer and cocktail list, and I hear the Strange Brew kills it daily.I want to try the bologna sandwich one of these days, but it's hard to come here and not have a burger.  Brodikoff is killing it with this place."
"Place is phenomenal. The wait is worth it and you can head across the street and have a drink at Haymarket til they text you (after getting on the list). The motza ball soup is perfect for a cold afternoon/evening and I think all the burger reviews speak for themselves - best in the city. If you don't get a pickel-back, you didn't go."
"Let it be known that I have lived in Mississippi the majority of my life and have never come across bacon as good as this.  What type of sorcery is this my mouth and eyes thought. The mashed potatoes were great and the burgers that we ordered were also fantastic.  Me personally, I prefer BBQ sauce to go along with my burger, but sans the BBQ, it was still great.  Believe the hype, this place is great."
"BELIEVETHEHYPEAfter several tries of coming here to find long torturous waits or a closed kitchen, I finally got lucky on St. Patty's weekend. I wholeheartedly agree with the 800+ 4-5 star reviews on here & admit that it is worth the wait. This is fancy fatty gourmet diner food done right & definitely blows Little Goat out of the water!"
"I feel a little guilty giving this place 3 stars.  I mean, it was hyped up so much, I kind of knew deep down that it would never meet my expectations (or maybe I just have very high standards, and I'm okay with that). I don't usually mind a dark restaurant, a little mood lighting never hurt anyone.  However, and at the risk of sounding like a geriatric, this place was terribly dark.  Good luck reading the menu or even seeing the person sitting across from you.We started with the bone marrow, which was good.  But gotta admit, Purple Pig's is better.  And we had cheeseburgers with fried eggs for our main course.  Again, good, but not out-of-this-world,-best-burger-I've-ever-had good.So I'm torn.  I liked Au Cheval and had an overall good experience, but I just don't think it's enough of a stand-out place to go back."
"Came during July 4th weekend, and it was surprisingly not crowded. Took only 10 minutes for a table, compared to 2-3 hours for a non-holiday weekend.1. Foie Gras and egg is still heaven on a plate. One of the best things I've ever eaten.2. The quality of the burger has gone down since introduction. Still moist, but not as beefy and a little bland now.3. General Jane chicken: At first I thought it would be a bargain looking at pics, but then I realized I'm paying $17 for 4 pieces of dark meat and 2 wings. That said it was good, the cilantro with the sauce is a stroke of genius. It isn't a must-have I admit4. Fries with garlic aioli - pretty good. The sauces were great and the aioli is amazing. I'm starting to hate this trend of throwing a fried egg on top of everything. It makes even less sense on fries. Runny eggs add little flavor to dishes, just richness. So when you pair it with a fat emulsion like mayo and aioli, what the hell is the point? It just gets lost.5. As I predicted before, the mash potatoes are better without the gravy. I highly recommend it without the gravy which cuts into the richness.6. The baloney sandwich is okay. Pretty salty when had it.7. Mille Fuille is nice, unfortunately I hate chocolate flavored dishes so it wasn't as enjoyable for me."
"I'm not sure why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 my first time around. But add the  Chopped salad with bacon egg & ranch, Crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy, and Toasted open-faced ham & cheese fondue with fried egg to the list of the delicious things I've had at Au Cheval. So far I haven't tried anything that wasn't lick-your-plate good. Also, if you work in the Loop, it is possible to do lunch here without feeling like you're playing hookey. Just take a cab both ways and get to Au Cheval at 11am."
"This restaurant is the bomb diggity.Although it is not very spacious, the quality of their food is yuuuum.FOIS GRAS - thats all I need to say.And the fries were amazing.I think I definitely need to come back again soon!!!!!!!!"
Over a two hour wait to be seated....and this was already at 730 pm.  Yes I realize it was a Friday night but that was just too much.  I had to work the next day so we passed and went to Haymarket across the street.  It's a shame because this place was highly recommended to us by the office I was in town training for and they had even attempted to make a early reservation for us through a hostess there they know.  So....no reservations taken here.  Be aware if you plan to go.
We called owner to make sure they were open 7/4. We made plans. They decided not to open that day after  we arrived. No apologies or anything. Just put up a sign in front of our faces. Turned away 50+ customers.
"I heard this place was amazing.It is not.I arrived with my date and the place was packed. Good sign I suppose, had to wait over an hour to get a table. There is no waiting spot so you are in the waiters' and costumers' way. Somewhat chaotic.Finally we sat down.Chair and table were wobbly... actually my chair felt like it was going to come apart. Order one of their famous burgers, french fries and a Coke. I get my Coke and it was a canned soda. I thought perhaps it was a Mexican or International Coke because they are healthier... nope just a regular US Coke in a can. Burger and fries arrived, they tasted quite unique. All the food tasted very odd. They use pork fat to cook the food! My date was a vegetarian. We couldn't finish our meals. Their sauces were so strong, had to scrape it off my burger.Service was fair.Won't return."
"For fans of red meat and pork, this is a really amazing place. My friends got the burgers and the bologna sandwich and it looked great and they were obsessed from the first bite.I, on the other hand, am not a really big fan of any meat other than seafood and poultry so I kind of had limited options here. The chicken is too big to order solo, so I went with a Scottish salmon special. Perhaps it was the fact that I'm not a big British Isles food fan, but the salmon was pretty bland. I mean yes, it was great quality and cooked well, but nothing I couldn't have done myself at home.I will say though that the fries and aioli were DELICIOUS and the drink menu was quite solid. Lots of nice beers to choose from.So, in the end if you really like higher-end comfort food, this is a great place to go. If you like spice in your life and/or are a vegetarian, maybe just go for drinks."
"Heard the burger was to die for--worth losing some limbs over for sure, but not death. I had the single and it was full of flavor, nicely cooked, and on a tasty brioche bun. The bacon lives up to the hype! I don't mind a mess but not into burgers that are swimming in sauce which is what I had. A bit too much cheese, sauce and grease for me. The aioli fries were AMAZE BALLS! Next time I'll skip the egg, awkward to eat on fries and doesn't add much in terms of flavor. Service was great, waitress was friendly, and prices were very reasonable. Expect an epic wait and don't head out on a completely empty stomach--you'll end up getting crunk at Lone Wolf while waiting the 2 hours for your table."
"Very yummy! I'm eating my leftovers right now. I had the hash with duck heart gravy, quite yummy, and not too expensive (considering they are well known for their food). My friend's had bacon burgers, I stole a bite and they are also quite good. Make sure to get bacon on them!The staff is nice and pretty helpful."
The bf really enjoyed this place for his atypical burger and fries. I'm not much of a burger person but this place was still pretty enjoyable because of their unique spin on burgers. The meals are extremely heavy though so make sure to come with an appetite! I only give this place an 'ok' rating because I was hoping for lighter menu options.
"Excellent pub food and a great beer selection.  Had the bone marrow appetizer and split the double cheeseburger with sunny side up egg.  No complaints,  friendly and busy -  get there early"
"I went to Au Cheval for the first time today for lunch.  The bf and I got there around 2:30 pm which was 30 mins before kitchen closing time.  The place was still pretty packed, but we got seated fairy quickly. We both got a single cheeseburger with bacon, fried egg, and avacado.  The single burger actually came with 2 patty and was huge.  The patty was juicy, the bacon was a thicker cut and delicious, and the egg was just right.  We also had a side order of fries.  I was kind of iffy about the fries at first because it was the thicker cut and i like my fries crispy.  To my surprise they were fairy crispy.  The service was great, our waiter was really attentive and helpful.  I would definitely come back here again soon."
"Good burgers, but very cramped, not much seating. The hostess and staff are rude and uninviting,  and make you feel like you should feel lucky to get a table."
"Ate here for lunch almost 8 months ago and I still think about the omelette I had that day. Totally, unbelievably unlike anything else I've had, and inimitable after many attempts.The egg had an almost custard like consistency that made it so much more interesting than a regular omelette from any old diner.Highly recommended!"
"Hands down my absolute favorite cheeseburger in the city.  Always perfectly prepared and bursting with flavor.  Just remember that a single is a double and a double is a triple.  Very easy to forget.  If you get it with bacon and a fried egg, it can serve as your only meal of the day.  So delicious.  Great fries too.  Overall perfect food."
"Excellent brunch. Perfectly cooked scrambled eggs. Try the English breakfast. One of the top burgers in town, too."
"I had a marvelous Valentine's Day date here with my boyfriend! We both got champagne, burgers (delicious) and shared fries that came with a lovely garlic aioli.The food was fantastic and my date was perfect!"
"I wish they took reservations, I really do. 'Tis the only hitch in the Au Cheval get-a-long.The wait is dirt nasty. Even mid-day during the week.It is always busy. Try going on off hours. It don't matter. Busy City, Bitch. The [slight] bonus to that, is that while you are forced to succumb to the wait, the ambiance is pretty much always slammin'. 2:00pm on a Wednesday feels like 10:00pm on a Friday. Loud. Music pumping.Feet thumping.Raucous.Bodies pressed up against each other. Beer sloshing out of delicate, tulip-shaped glasses.There's no shortage of things to see.Or people that are sexy.The vibe here is certainly young Chicago. Au Chev ain't pleasing the parents.But it pleased me, yes it did. The most unexpected pleasure? The sweet, tangy, spicy General Jane's Chicken Wings.They are EVERYTHING.A total hidden ninja on the menu and not to be missed. The Cheeseburger is consistently top ranked and for good reason. It stands out in its simplicity and lack of adornment. Essentially, the anti-Kuma burger, yet every bit as toothsome and savory. Love. The service is meh. Aloof and too busy to be warm or truly attentive is a bit Manhattan for my taste. My taste typically craves roasted bone marrow with mounds of fresh, flat leaf parsley. Which they have, too. So I'll shut up and eat my bone innards, if you keep those burgers coming with a smile."
"Sunday brunch: burger, great fries with garlic mayo and Bloody Mary.  Best burger in Chicago?  prove me wrong...one of my favorites."
"This place is super delicious. Lots of items that are deliciously rich and bad for you in many wonderful ways. The scrambled eggs with foie gras boring but tasted amazing. There's a bit of a wait on a weekend due to the limited seating but well worth it. Lots of beers, limited on the girly cocktails. Womp womp."
"Sooooo... I went back to Au on Saturday with one of the burger-loving dudes I mentioned in my original review because, well, he was craving the diner's cheeseburger. I, on the other hand, wanted brunch. Brunch in the form of eggs. And little did I know, the best simple breakfast/eggs I've ever had.seriously. ... I'm sure butter played a factor (a major, my-heart-cant-breathe factor) but I've never tasted eggs like that before. Scrambled the ""right way;"" just set with buttery juices flowing and the roasted tomato on the side? Butter-herbed? I don't know but I do know service was sweet, attentive and not rushed. Beers were top notch and while my companion said his burger was worth his trip from Naperville, I know damn well my eggs were worth the 45 minute wait and worth my want to go back. Already."
"Wow. Amazing. Believe the hype. I have done all of the ""famous"" burger places in Chicago and this is easily the best. Really outstanding."
"Excellent value for $ with dishes that serves 2 and meant to be shared.  Laid back 5-star service that is fully knowledgeable about the dishes, company history, and mindful water refills with a smile.Foie Gras with Eggs -- Bravo Executive Chef for a unique idea with magnificent flavor through marination, cooking style, and integration of foie gras flavor into the egg mixture.  Good amount of foie gras bits.  No choice in bread, but I understand the creative process and perfect complimentary flavor.  Bread was perfectly buttered while staying crisp.  You get 2 thick slices, cut in 2.Side Thick Bacon - comparable pricing (5 slices for $8.95) whereas another establishment charged 2 slices for $5.  In addition to peppercorns, bacon has sweet glaze.Horse's Neck -- an off menu suggested cocktail when I deemed the brunch cocktail selections to be dry and bitter.  Thank you Alexa!  A trendy cocktail filled with ginger beer.Au Cheval gladly serves food until the kitchen closes at 3 pm.A thoughtful company hires thoughtful and happy staff.  Thoughtful to the extent that the female bathroom amenities beat many luxury hotels in Chicago -- 3 view mirror, just-in-case monthly surprise visitor tucked away in a bamboo box, hand soap and lotion!An open kitchen that everybody likes to see by taking up all the available counter seating.  No ounce of smoke in the air.  Witness hood efficiency.A diner with romantic lighting and mood with quality food selections and ingredients."
"I've lived in Chicago for nearly four years and before that near Miami, FL and all around Spain. I have traveled to Germany, the Netherlands, Thailand, Tokyo, Britain and France. So let me tell you, Au Cheval has been compared to some of the best restaurants, not just in Chicago or the states, but around the World. This new contemporary French-American Diner has seriously one of the best menus, ambience and overall vibes I've ever experienced. It is a rather small diner that fits probably 50 people tops. From their ""General Janes Honey Fried Chicken with Chili, Sesame & Cilantro"" to a tasty ""Roasted bone marrow with beef cheek marmalade,"" it is obvious that this diner is doing something right after being open only 1.5 years. But the Pièce de résistance, is Au Cheval's burger. More than anything, this is what makes me wait two hours for a table. At this diner, a single is actually a double and a double is a triple. I know that sounds complicated, but I promise, it's not. After that calculation, the rest of the options for this burger are simple. First off, do you want cheese. Second, how about a perfectly cooked fried egg? Third, what about quarter-inch thick, peppered bacon, seared to perfection? Regardless of the combination of these three, you're burger is topped with house-made pickles and creamy red-onion dijonnaise. Even the brioche bun seems to be in a league of its own. This upscale dinner in many ways reminds me of waffle-house style spot. You can sit at the bar and watch the line cooks bust their rears to make a perfect burger. Yep, I said that- the perfect burger. I think this place surprises people- you expect a ""diner"" in the traditional sense since the building says ""diner."" But in reality, Au Cheval elevates the idea of a diner to a new place. When I walk in, I feel transported into a classic ""speakeasy"" from years past. The lighting is dim but appropriate. The staff are friendly, kind and humble. The soft music plays on a vintage reel-to-reel player. The options for drinks (including craft cocktails and beer) match the decor perfectly. I'd recommend the Hemmingway Daquiri but there are others as well. This burger deserves recognition.Au Cheval should be added to this list of memorable treasures. Each time I walk into this diner I tell myself I will try something new. When I do, I am always happy and not surprised by the quality and diversity of the food. But ultimately, I always come full-circle and order their delicious burger. One that satiates my hunger and makes me feel like a million bucks."
"We went on a Tuesday night around 7. I expected with it being a Tuesday that we wouldn't have one of the historically long waits you hear about on Saturdays. Wrong. Still ended up waiting 1.5 hours for a table. Host and bartender were kind of rude initially and we had a hard time getting a drink in the cramped waiting area towards the front. We contemplated leaving. I'm glad we didn't. Once we got seated, our waitress was very friendly. We had the crispy fries with an egg and, of course, burgers. I pity the fools I saw ordering chicken wings. The burger was easily one of the best burgers I've ever had. Get it with bacon. Don't change any of the other toppings."
One of the best burgers I've ever had. Definitely add the egg and bacon to it. Rye fried were probably cooked in the bacon grease as they had an unusually yummy flavor. The painkiller cocktail wasn't too sweet and had just the right amount of rum. Do make sure to put your name in at least an hour before as they don't take reservations.
"This place has the best burger in town.  Get an egg on top, it's worth it.  I try to bring all my out of town guests here because it's so good...and I have never had a complaint.  General Jane's honey fried chicken with chili is also amazing.  My wife hates chicken.....seriously hates chicken....and she loves this dish.  Super crispy and just plain delicious.  The french fries are great too.  We've also tried the bone marrow.  It was good, but I seriously love the burger.  The only bad part is the waiting.  If you go with just 2 people, the wait usually isn't bad especially if you are willing to sit at the bar (which can be fun as you can watch them crank out the food at an astounding rate), but if you go with 4+ people be prepared to wait 2 hours to sit.....also, here's a tip: it's worth the wait."
"Stopped in for a quick burger last Sunday afternoon. Luckily since we were very early, we didn't have to wait and grabbed a seat at the counter. Once being a server myself, I highly recommend sitting at the counter and watching the cooks work their magic in the open kitchen. We both had the single burger with the egg. The burgers didn't disappoint and deserved all of the hype they have received. The burger was full of flavor. I loved the  Dijonnaise sauce. And the egg was perfectly cooked, leaving a bit of yolk to drizzle into every bite. The housemade pickle that accompanied it was appropriately briny and crisp. The place is very small so come at off times if you don't want to wait for too long. As we were leaving, there were tons of people waiting outside to be seated."
Damn good burgers just don't order a double as the regular has two patties. Sat at the bar last time and was able to see how they prepare everything. Well oiled machine is the only thing I can say...very efficient.
"Good burger but be careful the waitstaff is not always the most pleasant. My husband and I frequent this restaurant and tend to overlook the impolite, often rushed service given by the hipster waitstaff but tonight was kind of ridiculous. I ordered a glass of Pinot for a start...once it was brought to my table I noticed the wine carafe was cracked along the rim with chips of glass in the wine. This was made aware to waitress who did apology and then ordered a new wine carafe to our table. Another server brought the wine with an attitude, not clue why he was so rude. I simply requested a fresh glass that didn't have chips of glass in it. The waitress offered to comp dessert which I ordered then once I received the bill noticed I was charged $12 for dessert, she then stated she said she would only comp wine??! What the heck? This is not what she stated hubby and I both confirmed with each other that she was wrong.  I didn't make a scene just paid bill and gave waitress minimum 20% but I felt I was too kind considering we already adjust for the service so we can enjoy a burger but this was a bit too much for me."
What an amazing place. All the way from Texas and they had the most amazing food and great choices of beer. Everyone is super friendly and works fast to get that good out. Great old bar feeling!!
"This was a total WIN!!!  It was my first time visiting Au Cheval but it won't be my last!!  Recommended by my friend who lives in Chicago and knows all the great places.  This was the greatest A+ suggestion I've ever received.  Started out with Bloody Marys and beer chasers.  They were I over the top. The ""salad"" in the glass was nibble-able thru out the whole drink. Next, the chili and 2 big spoons.  It was incredible.  Seriously the best chili I've ever tasted and I make the best chili I've ever tasted!  Smokey and bacony.  So good.  Burgers were, again, some of the best I've ever eaten.  There is a cool vibe here and I loved watching the kitchen cook in plain view.  In the words of Arnold...""I'll be back!"""
"Yes, the burgers are delicious. I thought it was all hype but the burger is mighty tasty (and greasy). It puts DMK Burger to shame.Get the single cheeseburger with bacon and a fried egg. You may even want to consider sharing this with someone - you may not fit into some of your pants the next day. The egg is fried perfectly (soft and uncrusty) and the bacon literally melts in your mouth. Super delish.The restaurant is a flustercuck; it's small and crowded with young, hipsters and yuppies. Come early or wait at the bar, that is, if you like flustercucks.Decent selection of beer. Cocktails are made too quickly; it ain't no craft cocktail bar.Au Cheval...a place to get a really, really good cheeseburger, with bacon and fried egg ;)"
Really good burger and a nice vibe but frustrating to stop by mulitple times on different nights of the week and have to wait more than an hour to get seated (even at 11pm one night).  There is an open space next door so perhaps this means the restaurant can expand and seat twice the number of guests?  As long as you manage your expectations you'll enjoy the experience.
"Worth the wait. Know that it will be 1-2 hrs going in, put your name down and have a been or 3 at one of the many fine options nearby. Everything you hear about how great the burger is is true, though my favorite may be the duck heart hash. Worth it, every time."
This is the burger that all other burgers aspire to be.
I love the food here. Everything is good but the burger haha. I am seriously the only person who didn't find the burger as good as everyone claimed it to be. It's a very hip place the service was good. I would definitely return and bring friends with.
Got a double cheeseburger which is actually a triple cheeseburger. Fucking delicious. Good selections of beer. Ambiance is nice. Dark and cozy. Waitstaff and cooks were in high spirits. Great place.
"I usually go for lunch on the weekend the minute this place opens because it fills up fast.  There is a very good reason for this: amazing food, amazing drinks, and it won't cost you an arm and a leg.  If asked to add fried eggs to anything (even fries)...just say yes.  You will not be disappointed."
"The best bet is to get to Au Cheval early and wait until they open. Once open, every seat is full and the 'wait' begins; which is usually about 2 hours.I would personally recommend sitting at the bar.  Au Cheval can get rather loud and having the birds-eye seat to watch the chef-staff do their 'thing' is always fun to watch.  They don't have a ticketing system, which is also cool.Anyway, on to the food.  The béchamel sauce served with the fries is a must try.  You can't go wrong with béchamel. :)The general's chicken was very good, but in my opinion, I'd like it more if it were boneless.  I really didn't care for getting messy with the bones and the skin and would have preferred to use my knife and fork.  The sauce was delicious.The burger was one of the best I've ever tasted; made on your traditional flat grill, along with everything else that is served from that very same grill. Served with an egg and I recommend getting it with the thick cut bacon too.However, the homemade fried bologna sandwich has to be my all-time favorite.  This 60/40% ratio of [ham] protein to fat emulsion with ice and white wine is pressure cooked for 6 hours, sliced very thin, and then fried on the grill prior to serving on the very light and airy toasted bun.  I was in heaven at the first bite.  If you liked bologna as a kid, this will bring back some fond memories! :)"
"Definitely one of the fanciest burgers around. You can't go wrong with the quality of the every part of the burger...make sure to add a fried egg! I got it with the thick-cut bacon, too. I can't eat that much in one sitting, so I was only able to finish half."
Sunday brunch was great.  I got a $65 parking ticket and I'd still call the meal a win!  :)The only negative is that it's crazy expensive.
"Went here for my friend's birthday on a weeknight. It was super crowded even though we got there around 5:30. We put in our name and went to Haymarket for a drink while we waited for them to text us that our table was ready. It's a really small, cramped place and once we got seated there were people crowding around our table. One of the people standing also caused our waiter to dump a drink on us.All that in mind, we both got the double cheeseburger (beware, it's actually a triple) with fries. We also ordered the pickles to snack on. The pickles were definitely good to have - they are light and refreshing which cut through the heaviness of our food. It's one of the best burgers I've ever had. And the fries are great - perfect crispiness, perfect cut. I couldn't finish my meal, and I'll be back to try something else."
"Listen up Chicagoans and listen up good.  Don't walk, RUN to Au Cheval. Overall I'm going to focus this review on ONE reason why you need to go there, but don't take that to mean that the rest of the food is mediocre.  No, both food and cocktails are fantastic.  Nearly everything on the menu is unique.  Either it's not served many other places (Bone Marrow) or it's just a great take on fan favorites(matzah ball soup, chopped chicken liver).  Basically, you can't go wrong with anything you order.BUT, there is an overwhelming reason to go above all others.  THE BURGER.  Do you think that the best burger in the city is served at Kumas, DMK, Burger Bar, Bad Apple, Nightwood, Lockdown, Rockit Burger, or something else?  Well don't worry; I was a naive dummy at one point too.I don't care what your flavor is, Au Cheval is the best burger in the city hands down.  A word of advice: don't be fooled by the double vs. single.  The single is 2  1/4 lbs patties and a double is 3 of them, so order accordingly.What's that you say?  You really like the mac and cheese at Kumas and the stupid thing they do to one of their burgers. GOOD FOR YOU.  You can put as much pastrami on it as you want, it still pales in comparison to Au Cheval's take.  It's simple, elegant, uses great ingredients and is loaded with awesome.If for some reason you have something against cheese, bread, hamburger meat, deliciousness, babies, puppies or winning the Grand Prize from Publisher's Clearinghouse then you should just steer clear.  All other functioning human beings NEED to go and try the burger. Even the most die-hard fans of one of the other hot burger spots in the city will realize after the first bite that 'their place' just got bested by Au F*cking Cheval.   Much like the 7 stages of grief, reasonable people can expect to go through the following:- Shock or Disbelief--""Oh my god, what is this flavor explosion? It's incredible!""- Denial-- ""No it is still definitely not the best burger in the city, that's just crazy talk.""- Anger--""THERE IS NO FUCKING WAY, WHO DO THEY THINK THEY ARE? THIS STUPID SMUG PLACE REALLY THINKS IT'S BETTER THAN EVERYONE?""- Bargaining --""Ok look it's definitely top 3. Can we just say that ""The Mastodon"" is still number one and we'll say this is like a close 2nd? Can we please?""- Guilt-- ""I can't like this more than Kuma's, I just can't.  I've spent so many loyal years telling people they are number one, oh my god what have I done?!""- Depression--""I hate myself.  I'm stuffed and I can't tell if these are tears of joy, anger, sadness or a strange cocktail of all three. How can this be?  My world has just been turned upside down and I don't know what to do.""- Acceptance and Hope--""Ok! Ok!!!  IT'S THE BEST!  ARE YOU F*CKING HAPPY?? YOU WIN....on the plus side I'm free to come back next Tuesday and try it with the bacon then :)""So there you have it.  To summarize, I too was one of the many who thought there was a better burger in the city, and I too was so very wrong.  Sure the others are good, but once you try this one, there's no going back.  Don't be ashamed though, embrace it, enjoy it, and go back for more.But just in case I will set up a hotline and regular meetings for those struggling with the middle stages of burger transmorphia."
"If you get here at the exact right moment, you'll beat all the rush into Au Cheval! If you get here a little late, the wait is definitely worth it. The atmosphere is very chill and I am a huge fan of open kitchens. Everything is extremely clean and the staff is great.We got the Burger Au Cheval (with an egg!) and it was great. The burgers are pretty large and packed with flavor. I'm a huge fan of the fries. As it started getting a bit crowded, the drinks took a bit longer to get to us (there was only 1 bartender), but our waitress updated us and the Old Fashioned was well worth the wait. Definitely will be coming here many times in the future!"
The bone marrow was delicious!   Never tried it before but it had a unique taste.  The sausage mashed potatoes were very good.  The thick cut bacon was just awesome!   Very tasty!!  Great service!  Tight corridors...hard to walk past tables if seated in the back booth.
Best burger in Chicago. I love the sauce they use for the fries. The bacon on that burger is some of the meanest bacon I've ever tasted. I always recommend this place to everyone.
"Outstanding. It's no wonder Bon appetite magazine has names it best burger. It's simply the best and it's an outstanding value. I've been more then a dozen times. If you don't want to wait don't go peak times. The burger, brat, French fries and duck heart hash to name a few great dishes !"
"DELISH!  While I must admit, from a pescatarian perspective, this place is geared toward those that enjoy meat; however, I had a delightful piece of salmon that just melted in my mouth.  It was cooked to PERFECTION.  While their menu is somewhat limited for a gal like me, it won't stop me from coming back to enjoy the vibe and tasty treats of this trendy spot."
"Au Cheval has been on my list of restaurants to try for some time. I had been hesitant to go due to stories of long wait times. However, it was well worth the wait and I will be coming back soon. It was a 2 hour wait on on Wednesday night,however our group grabbed some drinks across the street while we waited. The service was exceptional, our server was personable and noticed the food allergies in our group without us having to bring it up. Everyone in our group ordered burgers, and everyone VERY HAPPY with the food. My only complaint is that the space was very dark, which made it difficult to read the menu."
The best burger in Chicago. Awesome vibe too. I don't understand how it would get a sub 5 star review.
"Everyone already knows about the burger and the long wait. Both worth it!! But my impression of the place goes beyond the food. When you walk past, you'd never know this place has one of the best moods inside. The decor is done so well you feel no effort was made to age it, as if they just found the building wiped the dust and started cooking. The seats are perfect height and comfortable for a booth. The music is a wild mix of everything dubbed onto reel to reel tape and played and the perfect level to provide some life and not drown out the conversation. Last of all the staff is an amazing mix of every personality and all provide the great experience worth a 2 hour wait and 2 burger options!!! Try it and you will see why this place still has a wait!!"
"A Friday night before a Polar Vortex = only waiting 45 minutes for a table at Au Cheval. I was impressed by their efficient and logical drink-ordering system. A polite and calm server approached the dozens of bar patrons, personally taking drink requests. The ""Horse's Neck"" cocktail was delicious, but certainly not boozy; perhaps 8 parts ginger beer to 1 part Old Overton Rye- a mathematical misnomer to call it a ""strong"" drink, as the menu suggests. Stick to one of the numerous local and unique beers on tap.My friends received advice about the menu from their colleagues, specifically that the ""single"" cheeseburger actually consists of two hamburger patties. Maybe I should recognize the boldness of a restaurant that allows itself to change the laws of mathematics. To me it came across as a mild trick against first time customers. Is this a weak attempt at humor? Satiating Midwest appetites? The owners' evil plan to fatten up, mock, and play with the minds of trend-seeking, carnivorous consumers? The ""double"" is presumably three patties. But I do not pretend to understand the mathematical formulas of Au Cheval. Our server did not have any recommendations. She answered questions point blank, like a real logician. ""The cheeseburgers are a la carte.""  ""The cheese is American."" ""The meat is cooked medium-rare."" Period. She offered no suggestions. No small talk or niceties. That is the Ed Debavics formula...So why would I give this slightly arrogant restaurant four stars? The cheeseburger (with added fried egg) was OUTSTANDING, from the each single ingredient to the total sum of its greasy parts. So Au Cheval does understand a thing or two about math. A simple proof relays how the evening concluded: given the extreme salt intake of the burgers and sides, the only way to nullify the sodium was to add sugar + fat. Therefore we ordered gelato."
I love the burgers!!! Be careful when ordering the single means two pattiesAnd so on.... The taste is simple but great! DO NOT go with a party of more than 4 people or you will be squeezed like sardines in one table. On the weekends there is always a wait.
"I love this place, it is small and cute, our server was really nice. The food was so good!"
"Just OK,definitely was not worth the two-and-a-half hour wait.There was not anything really special about their burgers or fries. I enjoyed my food, but definitely wasn't blown away. I  had better burgers at DMK.Glad that I checked this place out but I wont be going back anytime soon."
"I've been here twice. The first for brunch and had the bologna sandwhich. It was really tasty and different. I probably wont order it again because i think they just have better offerings but it was great to try and i didn't regret ordering it. However, the burger (with that amazing bacon) is where it's at. i'm really bad at descriptive words, but it was incredible. I love burgers, they're probably my favorite food, and i'm hard to please. the cheese is amazing, the meat is flavorful and juicy and that bacon just adds the best kick. seriously, you wont regret the burger. i had this on my second visit last night while sitting at the counter. i loved sitting there because i got to watch them cook, and got to see some other things on the menu being sent out. they all looked great, but to be honest, it's going to be hard for me to order anything but the burger. the decor here is also really great. probably one of my favorite. not that that matters to alot of people, but it's worth noting. the service is terrific, too. oh and i almost forgot the fries! Also hard to please in regards to french fries but i couldn't stop grabbing for them. i left STUFFED."
Holy deliciousness. I'm generally not a fan of places that don't accept reservations and am even less of a fan of waiting for an hour to sit down. But even after an hour and a half wait I would come back for more burger deliciousness. Come hungry and be prepared to wait unless you show up mid week either really early or really late.
"Au Cheval has the best burger I've ever had in my life and I freaking love burgers.  Get the big one with bacon and a fried egg.  It's seriously heavy (and glorious).I'm actually not super excited about their fries, but the burger is so perfect that I don't care.  They also have a fantastic brunch that includes the best blueberry muffin I have ever had. If I had to pick one place to go eat that wasn't my favorite steakhouse, au cheval is next in line.  Show up early, this place gets seriously crowded fast (well deserved)."
"I went to Au Cheval for the first time with a few friends a few weeks ago. For some reason, it took forever for our drinks to come (both rounds of drinks), but other than that, we had an awesome time! We ordered the bone marrow as an appetizer, and even though some of us were skeptical about how appetizing it would be, everyone loved it! The hit, however, were the burgers. Mine was a 'single,' which is actually a double patty, with bacon and a fried egg. So delicious! Definitely going back and already craving that burger!"
"The food at Au Cheval speaks for itself. What really made this experience 5 star-worthy was the service today. I had a surprisingly painless brunch...maybe it was a fluke?I showed up right at 11am and got my name on the list. My friend showed up ~20 mins later, so I checked back with the hostess, who said it would be 30-45 minutes. Ok, fine, not too bad considering how long the wait can get here.My friend and I decided to find a coffee shop in the area while we wait, but we didn't make it to the end of the block before I received a text saying our table would be ready soon. We were seated within 5 minutes of returning back. Easy!The food service here is QUICK. Definitely not the place to go for a leisurely brunch. We each ordered a Bloody Mary and perused the menu. I went with the cheeseburger (with bacon and egg OBVIOUSLY), my friend ordered the bologna sandwich, and we split the fries with a fried egg on top.I'm still drooling thinking about the burger I ate 5 hours ago. Best burger I've ever had. My friend loved the bologna sandwich, but it was a bit too much meat for her (that's what she said...?). Being the fatass I am, I put some of her bologna on my burger because I am a true carnivore. The fries were amazing...the garlic aioli rocked my world. Our server was helpful, cheerful, and prompt.I will definitely be returning to Au Cheval. Maybe this week. Who knows. I live life on the edge."
"Awesome food, great service, highly recommend. Burger with egg & bacon a must have - one of the best I've ever had!"
"ok so this might be a close to $20 dollar burger after adding the bacon and the egg, but who cares? I don't ... especially when you give me a top notch, melt in your mouth, i want to sing when I eat this thang, BURGER. In love with the dim lit environment and even the drinks are good. I can't comment on the rest of the menu other than the delish fries with the egg on them. if you come and they tell you a long wait don't walk around, stand by the bar order a drink and they will sit you faster. GO THERE NOW!!!!"
"Went to Au Cheval for the first time on Saturday, November 1st (with five other people. Going into it, I knew we would have to wait several hours and that the booth would be a tight fit for 6 people so when we were told at 6:45pm that it would be a 2 hour and 15 minute wait, I was fine with it. We went to another bar...no big deal. We didn't get seated until 10:15pm, which was longer than we had hoped to wait, but again we expected it given all the hype and what people in our group who had previously eaten their shared. When we were seated, the server came over and the first thing she says is ""hi, what can I get for you?"" I was immediately put off by the unfriendly, pretentious and ungrateful attitude that the serve demonstrated. A simple ""thanks for your patience/waiting"" would have been so appreciated. In addition, she hardly checked in with our group throughout the night, which is why it took me about 10 minutes to get ketchup after my burger had been served, and I didn't even get it from her, but rather a table runner. Lastly, towards the end of the night, one of the people at my table had about half her dish still left over and asked the server if it's worth boxing it up, or will it not taste good the next day. The server responded with, ""I don't know, I never get food boxed here."" When we asked why, she responded with ""well, I know how much to order."" And we said, ""oh, so we over-ordered?"" And she says, ""yeah."" Call me old fashioned, but upscale diner or not, I expect the serve to provide better service than what we received. She could have guided us through the menu much better and not been so bitchy. There were six people at our table and all six of us independently came to same conclusion that she was pretentious and quite honestly, a bitch. It altered my impression of the restaurant because this is not a typical diner. It cost $140 for me and my fiancee's meal, which I'm completely fine paying at a restaurant where the food is good and service is welcoming. Unfortunately, the service was so underwhelming at Au Cheval that I don't have the desire to share that I thought the food was actually pretty decent (though not worth a 3 hour wait). I was so tempted to call the manager the next day to share my  negative experience, but decided that they probably wouldn't care anyway because of their status as a ""hot spot"" in Chicago. I won't be going back there on my own volition any time soon. So unfortunate because Gilt, Maude's and Bavette's are three of my favorite restaurants in the city and we are regulars at Gilt."
"Loved this place!  It's definitely not the decor I was expecting - much darker and more grunge than a ""diner,"" but still great in its own way.  We went at 10pm after seeing a show downtown.  This was the perfect time to show up, since by then there was no wait (they don't take reservations).  I can see how it would get really crowded earlier, as it's not very big.  We ordered the single burger (which is really 2 patties, while the double has 3), the fries with an egg on top, and a root beer float made with homemade root beer and Black Dog vanilla gelato.  The burger is juicy and delish, and you can't beat a homemade root beer float.  The fries were good, but next time I'd probably opt for the crispy potato hash, since the dipping sauces they give for the fries are nothing special.I'll be back for sure, since there's a ton of great looking items on the menu, including chiliquilas that are only served after midnight...looks like I'll just have to stay up past my bedtime!"
"This place is just kind of uncomfortable to be in. My friend and I were staying in Fulton Market and decided to stop in our way home. The person who greeted us (the owner maybe) was brusque about our bag, and we handed it over but the minute we sat down, we knew we really didn't want to be here. It's crowded, loud, and dark and you can't even hear yourself think, let alone hear your meal companion. That said, the waiter was friendly"
"I had this place on the top of my list for a while, everytime we pass by find out that the waiting time is not less than 2 hours till someday i had my name on the list and came back later on. we were really excited about it, and our waiter was really friendly and nice. we told her about our diet restriction of alcohol and pork, she came back a while later and told us that they use pork in everything, they use their fat to fry and in the seasoning so we couldn't try anything and we had to leave.I really appreciate the honesty of the waiter but i really wished that they had a little more options for ppl with this kind of restriction."
"Give me a break with this place. Half of the problem - the wait - is admittedly out of their control. That doesn't mean it doesn't absolutely suck and kill the experience. Look folks, it's a freakin burger. It's not one of Hot Doug's old insane sausages that were at least wildly unique and creative. Au Cheval is a burger and that's it. Why anyone would tolerate these Midway-Airport-On-Sunday-After-Thanksgiving-­Security-Line wait times is beyond me. It's completely over-the-top.Here's my real problem with the burger though. Do you know why it tastes good? Because it contains roughly 8,000 calories and 650 grams of fat. This burger has to seriously be the least healthy thing in America not meant for multiple people. You know how people rag on place like The Cheesecake Factory for serving these disgustingly unhealthy items that they should be ashamed of? Well my god, how has Au Cheval escaped the same criticism?? The burger is like a high class version of that old KFC ""Double Down"" sandwich, the one that substituted two fried chicken breasts for the bun. Look, if you take a half pound of beef, add two slices of cheese, put a full serving of pork belly on it, add a fried egg, add mayo-based sauce, and put it all in a buttered roll, guess what - it's going to taste good. But it will make you want to f---ing DIE the instant you're done. Even though it might taste good, its utterly gross. The same thing applies to 90% of the menu. At least area cardiologists are happy."
My date and I ordered the single cheeseburger (that's actually 2 patties) and I ordered mine with a fried egg and pepper cut bacon. Burger was cooked to perfection and the egg and bacon were perfect compliments. The only downside was that I thought the lighting was too dim and the service was less than stellar. But I go for the food and it was an A in my book
"Really cool, upscale diner in the Fulton Market area. I wasn't sure what to expect when walking into this place, I just knew I was supposed to come an try out one of the best burgers in town. When I walked in, I saw that place had a typical diner setup, with seats all around the bar, and small booths around the outside of the dining room. Yet, it was somewhat classy.  There was a little wait, but the hostess told us they would text us when a table was ready, allowing us to hit up one of the bars nearby to grab a beer while waiting. After a wait way shorter than we were told, we got the text saying we had seats available and we grabbed 2 spots at the bar.  First off, the menu isn't like one of those places that has an overwhelming number of options, but the options it has cover a wide variety. It was nice to know that if I wasn't getting a burger, I could choose between matza ball soup, a 32 oz pork porterhouse, fried chicken, or roasted bone marrow. I ordered the double cheeseburger with a fried egg on top, my friend got the double with bacon.  A minute after I ordered, the girl next to me was served her burger, and I saw the slabs of bacon on it, which basically looked like a third patty they were so thick. I quickly flagged down our server and told him to add bacon on mine, which ended up being a great decision. Long story short, the burger definitely lived up to the hype.  The double burger was huge, and the egg and bacon added was ridiculously awesome. I also really liked the fact that unlike most burger joints in the city, there isn't a long list of crazy burgers to choose from.  Simplicity is key here, single or double, bacon and/or fried egg. Greatness."
"The concept at this restaurant, like other Sodikoff establishments (e.g. Gilt Bar, Maude's) is that if your customers drink enough, they won't realize just how lousy the food tastes and you can still turn a profit. We tried the highly-acclaimed Au Cheval brunch. Big mistake. The menu is really limited. Probably only 8 items. The scrambled eggs on the English Breakfast and the chilaquiles were so salty they were inedible. When we asked if the eggs could be redone, the answer was ""no"" because they use only a ""proprietary mix"" and cannot make regular scrambled eggs. They offered any other type of egg we wanted, but apparently the skillet used to make over-easy, sunny side, over hard or poached eggs just cannot make scrambled eggs. How bizarre is that?? Worse yet, the people who work at this place, and especially Manager Christina, reek from way too much attitude. I suppose that this is because people actually stand in lines to eat the seriously greasy food, but it's really just because the joint is really tiny inside. So the appearance of popularity is just that - merely an appearance. If you want a great brunch, go elsewhere. Chicago has many far better choices."
"My first review of 2013! Naturally, I feel that I must review a place that inexplicably changed my life for the better to kick off a new year of eating and writing Yelp reviews.Dining companions and I shuffled in for the late night menu around midnight because they had a hankering for chilaquiles (more on that later). Since I already had dinner, I was feeling full and thought I would stick with drinking old fashioneds (oh little did I know what was coming for me!). The heavenly beverage placed in front of me smelled so citrusy fresh and sweet, I could've sworn they gave me liquid baby angels. I've had old fashioneds all over the city and this is by far my absolute favorite. Chilaquilas were flavorful, with perfectly scrambled eggs with guac and fresh tomatillo sauce. The chips were a little bit too rich and whatever animal fat they must've fried them in ended up overwhelming everything else. Fries and garlic aioli were a solid ""meh"" compared to...the BEST BURGER OF MY LIFE. We had the simple version, no bacon or eggs...just a good ol' cheese burger with the regular fixins. How could something so simple be so....PERFECT? Remember how I said I wasn't hungry because I ate dinner? Apparently the mere presence of this burger gave me a second stomach solely devoted to this vessel of meat paradise. Here's to more old fashioneds and perfect cheeseburgers into the new year!"
"I've had Au Cheval on my radar for quite some time.  The long wait times and a fussy eating little lady at my side thwarted every effort to try it out.  So, when Chicago's resident musician and I were putting together some happy hour plans this was my suggested starting point for our West Loop tour.  I arrived late to see my buddy waiting by the bar in the already packed diner and he astutely noted the reel to reel audio.  Music was pumping and the place was jumping even before six.  With some luck, our table was ready before our beers were even up.  They've got a good craft beer list on tap.  I drank Firestone Walker Union Jack IPA on this night.  It was then that we were greeted by the comedy team of blonde hipster girl waitress in training and blood red lipstick (big fan) mentor waitress.  After barely hearing a word the trainee said to us on the first pass, the other girl took lead on the next visit and we placed our order: single cheeseburgers with egg for both, onion on one, fries on the side.  We were about halfway done with our beers when the fries arrived, long before the burgers.  Would've preferred that those came out with the burgers.  Also odd was that I had to flag over one of our servers for some ketchup.  I'm always impressed by the variety of creative dippys, but a good bottle of Heinz ketchup is still the reigning champ to pair with fries.  A bit later our burgers arrived, or did they?  Two patties?  These couldn't be our burgers, we ordered singles.  Again we flagged down the servers, only to have them confirm that those were indeed our burgers.  Though both clearly lacked onions.  You see, the single is a double and the double is actually a triple.  And wha wha what is on third.  I could do without that confusion.  We both devoured our burgers.  It was very good and I will again remind those reading to get your burger with an egg on it whenever you see it, trust me.  I can't say that this was the best burger I've had in Chicago.  That would easily be Kuma's, where you can get them cooked to order.  I wouldn't even say that it's the best burger on Randolph (Grange Hall).  If you blindfolded me and said we were at Billygoat, I would have believed you."
Once again au cheval does not disappoint. amazing burgers. Great drinks. Awesome atmosphere. We did the chicken livers and they were divine. Loved the toasted brioche. We also tried the hash browns for the first time and I'm so mad we haven't gotten them before. One of the hardest dishes to perfect and these were cooked perfectly.  I mean perfectly. Burgers were awesome as usual and my old fashioned was just what I was needing.this will continue to be the only restaurant I will repeatedly come to.
"Three letters, OMG! The burgers were amazing! The bacon is thick and incredible tasty. It appears to be a simple burger, but the flavor was incredible and juicy. Come hungry and don't be shy to ask for three bacon and egg. Definitely wet youth the wait."
Amazing food... One of the best burgers I've had in Chicago.
"KenScale: 8.0/10Au Cheval is not a typical diner notwithstanding its appearance inside. It is one place in Chicago where I had two of the richest dishes that somehow I couldn't stop eating. Featuring American diner-style dishes with European influences from Brendan Sodikoff, the foods that I tried were so flavorful and polished even though they were quite on the heavy side.I tried potato hash with duck heart gravy and fois gras, scrambled eggs and toast. Each dish is a standout dish that offered so much tasty and worked together very well to give that pleasant shock to your tastebud. Although I felt guilty after consuming so much food (at lunch), I was very satisfied afterward. The restaurant has a hipster atmosphere, and doesn't take reservations. I would definitely suggest washing down the food with an excellent selection of their beer."
"Pretty solid place if you ask me. American bistro dining at it's finest. Great food menu and spirit list. Friendly staff and awesome decor made this place shine in my book. I definitely plan on coming back. Check this joint out, you will not be disappointed."
"This place was great! Traveling from Texas to see family and being from a huge meat eating state this place's burgers outdid anything I've had from the Lonestar state! We also tried the ham and cheese fondue with a fried egg, amazing! Nice ambiance with that trendy hipster vibe."
"Believe the hype. Best burger in Chicago. Get the bacon on it. Get the side of fries with the egg on top. Treat yourself to an $8 beer. Enjoy.Note: If you come here during dinner rush, you're gonna wait. If you're smart about your arrival time, you will not."
"hands down. THE. BEST. BURGER. OF. MY. LIFE. and i am not usually a fan of burgers either. TIP: you must add 1) thick cut peppered BACON and 2) fried EGG i just need to rant about this bacon. it's not your typical crappy, sliver of greasy bacon that you get at a low end diner.. this is a thick piece of juicy meat. it doesn't even look like bacon. talk about good ingredients!!!not a fan of carbs? although the bun is delish, you can opt to have no bun and have the burger wrapped in lettuce! as for drinks, the pickleback sounds wierd but is quite delicious and goes with the burger so well. yuuummand it's open until 1:30am. we got here around 10pm or so on a thursday and got a table immediately. there is also a plate of nachos that are only served late night! in case you're still not convinced (and believe those ridiculous non-5 star complainers), bon appetite just name it the #1 burger in america. bam! bonappetit.com/blogsandf…"
"We were told our wait would be 35 minutes, but it was actually 35 seconds.  We were seated at the grill and enjoyed a craft beer as we waited for our meal.  The burgers were not made to order, but there is no need to change a thing.  They were heavenly.  The garlic fries were a perfect compliment.  I can't wait to go back!"
That burger. I went in with high hopes as I was told it was the best in the city. Probably the best burger I've ever eaten. The chili con carne was so delicious too. Outstanding meal.
"Great burger. Awesome bacon. Fantastic bloody mary. If you are remotely close you must stop. The burger had bacon that was thick, juicy and filled with flavor. The bloody mary was spicy, filled with delicious pickle slices and hot peppers. And an olive to top it off.  My mouth is watering just thinking of what I just ate."
"Don't bring a kid and Don't believe the burger (or service) hype! There are much better burger options in Chicago.First, I went there at 11am with my wife and 1 year old to avoid the crowds, which we did. There was hardly anyone there and we were seated right away but we were then told there were no highchairs or booster seats. I could understand at an upscale restaurant but this is a hipster diner. They were obviously not pleased we were there. I'll give the waitress a pass because it was her first day and she put in an order for the wrong beer. The burger is good (as most generally are), two thin charred patties with a onion mayo dressing and pickles. I had the fries with mornay and egg as well which were good.If your looking for a burger with great meat I suggest Owen & Engine or Bad Apple (awesome service as well). If you want crazy toppings Kumas, Bad Apple, or Lockdown are great too.If I go back I would probably order something different and not bring my family."
"Horrible, disrespectful and unapologetic.  I never get time away as a new mom. I have lived downtown for 10 years in the west loop and I have been everywhere. Never have I been treaTed like this. I was prepared that i was paying a babysitter to check this place out knowing I would have to wait. The host Mike took down our name and number and told us it would be 1-1.45 hour wait. No problem. Two hours later, after trying to call several times w no answer, I came back and Mike says I texted you a long time ago w an attitude.  He is shuffling thru his papers to find he wrote down the correct number but didn't text the correct number. Mike tells me again we have to wait.  I'm starving at this point and had lost my patience. I asked if they could offer a us drink and w a snobby face mike tells me ""no I won't do that"". I was appalled he was so angry and unapologetic. It got the best of me and I said you have got to be fucking kidding me. He walks off to get his reinforcements Kurt the bar back. Scolding me like a child That I can't curse. Apparently these people don't curse.  I asked for a manager, Christine came over hostile to me also unapologetic. She asked wait by bar, I sit at the bar and Christine tells me I couldn't sit unless I was eating. Lol. We were actually sat w in 15 min. Once we sat down the server told us we had 3 min to order before the kitchen closed.  The bar was empty from then on by the way. Awful service.  Good food. Won't be back and wouldn't suggest anyone who desires a pleasant experience."
"I've been visited multiple times as my daughter LOVES the burgers. They never disappoint however the staff is what will push me to other high ranking burger joints in the city. The last time I went, our waitress seemed disappointed that we sat in her area from the moment we were seated. She barely made full sentences as it seemed she didnt want to waist her breath. So disappointing seeing that we spent nearly seventy bucks for a couple burgers and a couple orders of fries."
"I know this is the general opinion, but seriously the best burger in the city. I could eat an entire bowl of fries here also. Outshines Kuma's by far! Go to Lone Wolf while you're waiting and the time will fly by."
"We had a reservation for 4 at 10PM on a Wednesday Night. This is a late dinner for us on a week night, but a special occasion as we had guest just getting into town. We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and the joint was packed. We grabbed a drink at the bar and waited for our table. We were seated at a cozy booth in the back corner of the restaurant. The space is dimly lit and very intimate. The waitress comes over and was less than friendly. Maybe she was annoyed that we all already had full cocktails and we weren't ready to place our order. I am assuming it was nearing the end of her shift and she had a long day. Perhaps, I am just being nice and creating excuses for her less than desirable attitude. Anyway, we look past it, as it's been almost a year since we've seen each other we aren't going to let this Debbie Downer ruin our night. When she appears back to the table we order crispy fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli, and farm fried egg and General Jane's honey fried chicken. The boys devoured the crispy fries and my girlfriend and I were in heaven with General Jane's Chicken. The chicken was juicy and incredibly flavorful - so good! Our friendly little waitress graced us with her presence again and we placed the order for our main dishes. The boys each had the double burger with the fried egg  and my girlfriend and I shared the single. The food was really flavorful and very heavy - we might have went a bit overboard on our order, but that's on us. It was delicious none the less. The only reason I couldn't justify five stars was the service. I understand, we all have bad days and really long days that we wish we would end, but just be honest. If that was the case, if our waitress would have just come to the table and been somewhat friendly and state that she had had a long day - we'd totally understand. Honestly, we probably would have cut her a lot more slack. Instead, she just came off as rude and aloof."
"This is definitely a party you would rather be late to than never join. I'm not sure why it took me so long to hit up Au Cheval, but I'm totally dancing to their jam. Went on a Wednesday night at about 5:30 with a party of 2. Seated immediately. Waiter was very nice. Hostess was very nice. Had burgers (mine with bacon, his with egg). Shared an order of fries and bread and butter pickles. Horse's Neck cocktail was delish. By the time we left around 7 there was more of a wait, but not a huge line or anything. And a wait is worth it here. We'll be back."
"This might be my absolute favorite place in Chicago. There indeed is a 2 hours wait on most nights (I went on a Saturday around 7) but do yourself a favor and stop by Lone Wolf right next door and have a few drinks and a good conversation. The wait is totally worth it! We ordered a round of burgers with bacon and egg (no shit), fries, and roasted bone marrow with beef cheek marmalade. The burger was probably the best thing I've ever eaten. I'd honestly rather wait 2 hours for that burger than get a different burger at Kuma's every time. It isn't ground breaking or anything, just perfectly executed. Really though, that seems to be their motto. Simple, indulgent food, done extremely well. The bone marrow dish was delectable as well. After running out of toast, I performed cunnilingus on the bones lol. You can't let that stuff go to waste!Everything else was great. The service was friendly and attentive. The old fashioned was stiff but sweet. They were even playing old school hip hop. I have a feeling I'll end up here once a month, at least."
"Holy sh*t this was the best meal I've had in a very long time! Must get the sesame chicken and the burger! We got lucky and scored two seats at the bar, but there was a wait. I loved everything about this place and will be back!"
Amazing!!!! My girlfriend and I went with her family this evening. No words came out of my mouth as I inhaled the double stack burger. So good. Must go. Wish I could eat it everyday
"My boyfriend deemed this restaurant as having the best hamburger he's ever had in life! I'm not a hamburger person, but I enjoyed a bite of it myself. The menu was definitely parisian featuring mainly meat and egg dishes. I would have liked to have more vegetables on the menu, but everything that was on the menu was delicious."
"Best burger in town! Usually 45-90 minute wait so put your name down, cross the street for drinks and they'll text you when your table is ready. Decent service. The place is small and not a lot of seating. But focus is the food here. Great all around from the burger to the fries to dessert. Phenomenal."
"Pros: Arguably the tastiest burger. Great beer list. Very unique atmosphere. Cons: Soooo heavy - I've had the burger (single with bacon au Cheval) and the bologna sandwich on separate occasions and I felt like there was a rock at the pit of my stomach for several hours afterwards. And don't get me wrong, I like my meat folks. Also, be prepared to wait at least an hour on peak dining evenings. (Thurs-Sat) They do text you when you're table is ready but this is inevitable. Tips: One side of fries is enough to share! The single burger is not what it sounds like... I can't imagine how many heart attacks come with the double."
"Dishes my party shared:Foie gras scrambled eggsBurgerHashbrowns with Duck heart gravyBlue Cheese and Spinach OmeletteSides of Fries w/ eggs, Bacon, and Sausages.I am pretty torn about how to review the dishes at Au Cheval.  I would give it 5 stars if I was only limited to eating a couple of bites from each plate we had.  But after finishing our dishes, we all (5 of us) felt really miserable.  Not from being stuffed but from the content of the meal.- By far the richest food I have ever tasted in my life.  - Nothing even comes close.  - Felt like I was going to go into NSTEMi for the rest of the day.  I don't mind rich food but I think a touch of acidity and contrasting texture would compliment the dishes nicely to balance out the flavor.  Amazingly, the pickle that came with the burger was fought over being that it was the only thing that did not have a super rich flavor.  The service was excellent and the atmosphere is very nice but unfortunately, the disgusted feeling that lingered amongst us for the rest of the day was not pleasant."
"Wow! What a place! I went on a Sunday for brunch. It was perfect, we hit it at the right time, no wait!!! I have heard that the waiting was close to 45 minutes and I can see why! The food was amazing!!! Everything that was coming out looked fab!It has a small diner feel, they cook the food right in front of you if you're at the bar. I wasn't drinking that early, however the bar looked good. The bloody mary's looked delish as well as the other drinks coming past us. The servers were friendly and fast. I got the cheeseburger au chevel; it was a double patty with two types of cheese and their homemade thick cut bacon plus an egg! YUM YUM! Talk about good! Also, I had fries and a blueberry muffin also as good! I can't wait to go again!"
"November 5This place is amazing and I definitely had a magical time with a friend (more hopefully for me).  Anyway, I don't do the whole dating scene, but this hang out certainly doesn't feel like one.  This place is definitely somewhere you want to take a date.You cannot get a reservation here an it's a first come first serve basics.  You will get notify by text when you're next to sit.  So, that's pretty awesome.  Food can be a bit adventurous and toast for the items are unlimited and phenomenal!Pork porterhouse!  Bone marrow!  Sausage links!  Really great!  Be sure to tip well if you are enjoying the atmosphere than your usual dining time."
"Expect a wait because this place is small. The service isn't super speedy, but who cares? You're here to eat, to soak up the atmosphere, and to relax with friends. Bring your appetite because the food won't disappoint. Awesome French press coffee, yummy fries with garlic aioli and a fried egg, kick-butt hashbrowns (scattered, pan fried, then deep fried, OMG), delicious salmon rillette with a soft-boiled egg and pickles (!) ... I could've stayed there all day just eating. Staff was nice, music selection was awesome. Love."
"Health code violation or quality control?Let me say that I had been wanting to try this place for awhile, but couldn't tolerate the wait. Then I saw they were ranked as some of the top French fries in Chicago. Therefore, my date and I made a beeline for Au Cheval right after work. Seated at the bar, we ordered a cheeseburger, the fried chicken and a side of fries. We added an egg to the burger and it was excellent!  No choice on the cheese, no choice how it is cooked, but delicious nonetheless. The fried chicken was in a tasty sauce that reminded me of General Tso. The fries are indeed good. I recommend them with the Mornay sauce and garlic aioli. The menu is small, but thoughtful. Decent selection of craft beer and a very nice list of specialty cocktails. Pay attention to the cooks and servers. They will often sample items prior to serving them to customers. Have faith that they know what they are doing and this food will taste good!"
"I don't get it. I was so excited to try the burger here. I went early one Friday night and got a seat at the bar. We started with the shaved vegetable salad, which was delicious. Then I got a cheeseburger. It was so greasy, I couldn't eat more than a couple bites. The duck fat fries were gross- instead of enhancing the flavor of the fries, they tasted gamey. I felt so disgusting after eating here that I spent the rest of the night at the gym."
"Busy & Loud- not the best place to meet to do an interview- but oh, well.  Our server was adorable and so helpful.  The burger stood up to the hype.  It's was really, really good.  I love the cucumber that gives it the extra crunch!"
"I have yet to find a better burger in Chicago. My fiance and I come here often, split a burger (WITH a fried egg and slab of bacon on top), and an order of fries with garlic aioli. We both leave full and EXTREMELY happy. Additionally, there's a great selection of seasonal beers and the mixed drinks I've tried are strong and tasty. We've come  for the late night chilaquiles, the fried bologna sandwich that everyone raves about, general jane's fried chicken, as well as the foie gras and eggs - and while those were all delicious, we always come back to the burger and fries. Perfect. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is that we have never come in and sat right away without a wait (though going across the street to Haymarket for a beer or two is never upsetting), and it's extremely dark. Not great for when we brought our parents in. Otherwise, the place is a gosh darned gem."
Been here couple of times. Dinner and late night meal. Both times I had the cheese burger with egg and bacon and it was one of the best  burgers I've had ever!!Highly recommend it!!!!Only downfall is that thw waiting time on the weekend(Saturday) was 3 1/2 hr. Since they don't take any reservations! !!!
"What is so special about Au Cheval? Cheese burger is better than ok, but not amazing, or mind blowing. 1/2 lb. single is two 4oz preformed prime beef with a slice of cheese on each patty--a bit of a lazy juicy Lucy.  Patties are cooked on a flat top with salt and  pepper, and the cheese is melted on the patty in the broiler. The bun is nice, soft, fresh but not overwhelming.  The burger is served with house Dijon and pickles, with your choice of thick cut bacon and/or a sunny side up egg. For an extra $2 you can add an egg that is seasoned and topped with chives, and the bacon is nicely cooked, thick 1/4inch and peppered.  Nothing about this cheese burger screams come back and pay $9.95 for an a la carte burger. It's served with a pickle spear that is easily the best part of the meal; seriously damn fine pickle spear.  Should you choose to order a side, it's $5.95 for smashed potatoes au jus, or fries for the same price.  I would say the fries are an inadequate portion for the money. I'd like a bit more and for the price or to be charged less--more like $3.95. Same goes for smashed potatoes.  I noticed that they have some other items on the menu that have interesting prices, such as the chicken wings for $17.95. On the menu they are called ""general Jane's honey fired chicken"" or ""crispy fries with mornay sauce and garlic aioli topped with fired egg"" at $9.95, which is french fries in a boat drizzled with mornay and topped with an egg.  The service was fine--no problems with staff. The host was polite and took my phone number to send a text when it was time to be seated.  We were seated at the counter where it was fun to sit and watch the cooks do their thing. The appetizers and desserts cook was great to watch. She had a lot of fun making desserts and fries.  Our waitress was nice and prompt--our water glasses were never empty, etc. I am a foody, and can say I have had burgers that were equally good and much better,  probably for less money, with fries.  The thing here is we have a small seating space located in a hot spot amongst other trendy food establishments in the Fulton food district west loop of  expensive as hell Chicago.  Truth is the burger was good, not great and certainly not the ""best burger"""
"Ok... where to start with this one.  It's dark (painted black low light), it's a bit wanna be hipster, it plays real to real tape for music (good selection), it has a solid beer selection and good cocktails, the menu is limited.It's more of a 3.5 as the food is good but it's not high dinning.There's a dish that is a must have at the place which is the General's Chicken... if nothing else you must go to this place and try this dish.  I find it to be some of the best chicken I have had in Chicago.Next.... I get the burger, have been here several times and always get the burger.  Now I'm going to describe the burger but do not take it as a slam.  I find it to be one of the top burgers in the city but there are issues.  Wait still not describing it but now providing advice.... get the burger... however do not get the burger if you are on a first date or still not totally comfortable with the person you are there with.  They are very good but they are greasy, messy, large, tasty, burgers.  You get the egg on it... this is a must as they cook the egg just right not like some other places where they over cook it.  This adds to the mess as the burger is already greasy to as they cook it in its own fat.  Not healthy! you want healthy go get some sprouts somewhere and I do not give a crap about your vegan ways and do not want to hear about them.  So 1. Generals Chicken  2.  Burger.... skip cleaning up after the chicken as if you have the burger you're going to be messy any way.  I go full caveman when I eat here, i'm sure the waitresses are looking at me like some sort of weird old deranged guy... 3.  I do not care Now unfortunately I have a complaint... the fries really are not that great, they want to toss a egg on there as well but with the egg on the burger already I feel like I'm asking for a grabber right there at the table.  I'd rather see some righteous aioli or something down that path.  Like to see them redo the fries as they just do not live up to the rest of the food.This place is pretty much a hipster high quality diner type of setup.  It's a good to go place that I enjoy.  Prices are a bit high but I can get buy with it.  If it's jammed up have them text you when your table is ready and go over to Haymarket (I do not) or the Holiday inn right across the street.  Grab a Rogue dead guy for $4 eat some peanuts and do not worry about the atmosphere... Holiday is a good holding pattern while you wait."
"Believe the hype.  Until creationism becomes a reality and some mythical higher power bestows us with something more delicious than cow, this is as good as it's gonna get.  I get my bacon on the side, no egg, as I like to savor the delicious goodness on it's own."
"The au Cheval burger is phenomenal! We added the thick bacon and fried egg, possibly one of the best burgers I've had. The only downside of this place is that it's so popular, the waits can get pretty bad and they don't take reservations. I suggest coming a little before they open if you don't like to wait. Otherwise great place and must try in chicago!"
Again super.  I had the chicken liver.  Was abit hesitant but it was delicious.  Texture was spot and the hint of dill made it so addicting.  Cqme with that delicious toast.  Thanks for a great meal as always guys!
"The english breakfast is perfection.  When I ask for soft scrambled eggs at other brunch joints, I always compare them to Au Cheval's and they never measure up.  The baked beans are deliciously smoky and pair well with the texas toast they serve on the side."
"The worst customer service I have ever had in Chicago. They tried to seat me in a location where the bar garnishes (a bowl of grapefruits) would be in my plate; I asked to move it over and they said no. Then they moved me (I guess after realizing it was ridiculous). Then my server didn't ask how I wanted my burger cooked, I had to hunt her down and tell her. When my burger hadn't arrived after 20 minutes I walked out and went to Little Goat. It took everything in me not to yell ""eff you, I'm going to Little Goat"" on my way out. The food is probably amazing, but sadly I will never know"
"Service was friendly, prompt and helpful. Food was unforgettable. The beef cheek marmalade accompanying the bone marrow was outstanding. The double cheeseburger was the best cheeseburger I've ever had (thin patties, delicious sauce, pickles). The ham and cheese fondue open-faced sandwich was insane. My only complaint is that I only have one stomach and live 800+ miles away from Au Cheval."
"It seems like you are crazy if you don't absolutely freakin' love the single cheeseburger (really, two patties!) at Au Cheval, and after eating there last night I have to agree that this bad boy is amazing, so enuff said there.The two biggest surprises:1) The hash browns are quite possibly the most perfectly cooked potato in (small) mass production that I've ever had.  Seriously, I had heard a ton about the cheeseburger but nothing about these hash browns...sweet Jesus, these were good.2) The music playing this past Tuesday night was incredible.  Just a perfect blend of soul, rock, indie, etc.  It was a tad too loud, and if you are unfortunate enough to be seated under one of the speakers (and with anyone who has trouble hearing), you are totally hosed.  But the music coming out of those speakers was magic.Also, the $12 dessert (no idea what it was called), a fluffy mix of waffles and whipped cream, was great.  The fries were average but the dipping sauce that came with them--paired with the hash browns--was incredible.The wait was an hour but we went to Little Goat to grab drinks while we waited for our Au Cheval text message confirmation.  A great night!"
"Came here at 9pm on a Sunday and we had to wait about 15 minutes for a seat. Had a Flapper to drink; it was excellent. The food could only have been better if I was high. Incredible--cheeseburger, fries, root beer float. Thank God we live on the other side of the country or we would be here all of the time and as big as houses."
"Sure, it's a glorified diner (it used to be just that and has retained the original layout) but the burger and General Janes' honey fried chicken are solid! Add an egg and canadian bacon to the ""single cheeseburger"" (which is actually a double cheeseburger...) and you are in flavor country. Au Cheval doesn't take reservations, so put your name in and go across the street to Haymarket for a beer in their more spacious bar. Forget watching the game at Au Cheval, there isn't a screen to be seen. They will text you when your table is ready. Mr. Sodikoff, not the most flattering articule in the TimeOut magazine article, but I have to hand this one to you. Bravo sir. I plan to return with my law partner who has been known to take down cheeseburgers all over this great city."
"iMean...best gd burger in the city.  Let NO ONE tell you otherwise.  The key to getting in, is going around 2:45 OR 4:45 right before the kitchen closes and right after.  The waits aren't really as bad as they say-it goes a lot faster bc amateurs can't wait.  Make sure you get the egg and bacon on it-or go home."
"Great place. Food was excellent. I went there for brunch and ordered the foie gras and scrambled eggs. Delicious! Never quite had anything like this before and it was really good and different. I also ordered a bloody mary and it was great.  The ambience is dark, so if you want something different, it's a place to try out, however, not a typical brunch place with lot of light.It does not have the brunch ambience I would want from a place, but has a better feel for dinner. So, I would definitely go back to try their dinner menu. Overall, great restaurant."
"This food was incredible! I would go back in heartbeat.We went for brunch and ordered the chilaquiles (unbelievable good, I want more right now), salad (also great, very flavorful) the creamiest omelet I've ever tasted and the burger. The staff was very friendly. This place is tiny and gets crowded so get there early. And come hungry! You'll want to try everything."
"Top 5 favorite burgers. Every component from the bun to the meat was of high quality and perfectly executed. Added a fried egg and their super thick-cut bacon. Burger bliss. Wasn't blown away by the fries topped with fried egg and served with mornay and garlic aioli. The fries weren't as pillowy inside as I like, and while I liked the garlic aioli, I found the mornay sauce bland. I prefer the fries at DMK Burger Bar and Edzo's Burger Shop. The bologna sandwich was good, but after having it once, I don't feel the need to order it again. Perhaps if you loved bologna sandwiches as a child you might enjoy this sandwich more. Eager to return for their burger and to try other items such as the general jane's fried chicken. The burger is definitely worth trying. Recommend!"
"Vegetarians beware - you will starve here.HOT DAMN!  I'm a huge fan of Brendan Sodikoff so I've been looking forward to coming here for a long time.  We arrived at 5 on a Friday and, as Yelpers report, it was already half packed.  Arrive early or be prepared for a wait.I explained I'm not much of a brown liquor girl, but the Horse's Neck (rye, ginger beer, bitters, lemon) sounded intriguing.  It was my server's favorite drink, so I took a chance.  It was DE-LICIOUS!  I ordered a second.  Then my friend was jealous, so she ordered one too.  The beer list is one of the best around, but that drink was just too good.Foodwise, I absolutely loved my fried bologna sandwich.  I wasn't really sure what to expect, but it intrigued me.  It was so tasty, stacked high with thin slices of fried meat on a brioche bun.  The fries were so-so, I wish we had gotten the raw salad, it looked tasty.  My friend enjoyed her burger but it wasn't the best she's had (I see Yelpers have competing views on this).  We ordered a side of the peppercorn bacon and weren't disappointed.  It's well worth $8 for these giant cuts of tasty pork.  I loved Au Cheval and will return!"
"Man I love Au Cheval despite another rough start. I had to get up and ask for service.  The server said he was fooled by the way I set my silverware, side plate and napkin into thinking the other server had started our table.  I believed him.  The service was so good after that, but what was really on point was the burger that night.  It was pretty unbelievable how strong the definition of each flavor was.  The meat was meaty, the pickle was pickly, the fat was fatty, and the burger was balanced.  That's not just hunger talking- before the burger I ate a bowl of matzoh ball soup, a large sausage, and super rich mashed potatoes."
"we just recently moved two blocks away from the restaurants on randolph and au cheval was the first one we wanted to try on the strip. we came right before the dinner rush at around 5 and after we got seated the place started getting really busy. we heard their burgers were amazing- and yes they were! i had a double- which is actually like three patties and their single is actually a double patty. my fiancee had the single with bacon and egg, plus we shared the fries with the garlic aoili dip on the side as well as the bread & butter pickles. we both like very light beers so the server suggested the kiuchi brewery hitachino nest white ale.. for which a very small glass was a bit pricey- $12 but whatever it was great! about 7,000 calories later we left super full and satisfied :)"
Best burger in Chicago! (Better than Kuma's!)
"Burgers and fries are sooo good (but a little pricey) Big downside is that the wait time is always ridiculously long, but by far the best burger in the city! One of my new favorite spots!"
Wonderful burger and fries. Good beer selection. Dark and cozy. Ok place to take kids during the week too.
"The burger is amazing! Fries are crispy and fresh. Atmosphere is fantastic. Food gets five stars.The hostess, however, requires additional training. Her job is to expedite seating and manage expectations - tonight she failed at both. We were told the wait would be an hour and a half to two hours, more than two hours later we received a text that we should return for a table. When we arrived the hostess told us that it would be another fifteen minutes. That was thirty  minutes ago. We have been waiting more than two hours and a half, and don't have a table. Hostess gets zero stars."
"The burgers are good. They don't ask how you want it cooked, and I really dislike having my burger bleed every time I take a bite. Also took way too long to get my drink. In all honesty, I've had better burgers at five guys, but don't you dare say that to all the people who are willing to wait 2 hours for there chance to eat here!"
"This place nails it.  Awesome food, great vibe, really nice people.  Can't tell you the number of times I have caught a ""you're lucky to even be here vibe"" from the staff of a hip/now/hot/whatever spot.  Not here - everyone from host to owner was super cool.My first time and I came for the burger so that was the call.  They don't ask how you want it or what you want on it other than egg or bacon.  I think they do that so you don't fuck it up.  I sat at bar so I was able to watch them make it.  One chef did bacon, another did patty and bun.  A third chef was covering eggs and fries.  They make 3-4 at a time, carefully crafting from bun to bun then stab a knife through it and ship it out.  A server picks it up, wipes the plate and delivers it to you (even at the bar). Fries, etc are a la cart.  Burger was exceptional - if you take nothing else from this review, hear that.  For me the cheese was key.  It was tasty all around but the cheese was insane.I will be back again - prob for brunch.  Its pricey for burger/fries/beer but it is so worth it.One more thing - beer selection is solid.  Id guess 15-20 taps and lots of interesting stuff."
"Awesome cheeseburgers.  It's that simple.  Start with the wings as an appetizer, you won't be dissappointed."
"Delicious!! We waited about an hour but there are so many places near there to go see while you wait and then they text you, when your table is ready. Defiantly get the burger! Fries were delicious and also the sweet pickles were great too. Place is a little small so don't expect to have a lot of room. You're there for a quick drink and burger and for how fast service was you won't mind not having the space! A must go!!!"
We've been back a few times now for the burger. It's all about the burger here. I don't even bother looking at the rest of the menu anymore. We get a double with bacon and an egg. You have to get the bacon and egg! We share it. We may order a couple of beers. They always have a great selection. And I'm not kidding... It's all about the burger. This thing is the best griddle burger ever. It just drips with deliciousness.
"Yep, yep, yep. yep, yep.  Leave your HDL and LDL concerns at the door and dive into this great menu.  Burger.  The bomb.  Frites.  Yummo.  Fried chicken.  FABULOUS.  Very large servings -- a great great meal.  The loss of one star from me is due to the wait.  Granted, we got there at 6:15 PM on a Friday and it happened to be the week that they received the Bib Gourmand.  2 hours?  Okay, I can deal with that.  Three hours later, when I checked back, they did not have a table because diners were just hanging out.  We did get seats at the counter which worked out well but, in principle, I would NEVER wait three hours to eat.  Next time (and there will be a next time), I will plan better."
This place is super tiny. Probably only has like ten tables. But its worth a wait. The burgers are one of the best I've ever had - maybe that has to do with the 1/2 inch thick bacon it it...And their fries with the fried egg are crazy good. A must go.
"Two words: SALT OVERLOAD.I have never in my life felt so disgusting after 3 bites of food. Its salty and fatty in the worst way.But yet, we keep going back. It's that salad, the one with the bacon and egg and creamy dressing. It's like crack and I'll take the salt hangover any day to eat that damn thing again."
"So I really wanted to fall in love with Au Cheval since I'm a big fan of this type of food, of this type of vibe. We came in around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed. We chose to wait for a table for about 15 minutes, but we could have just sat at the bar immediately. The host/hostess were really nice and accommodating and they quoted us the right wait time. Okay, so on to the atmosphere, it's very cute inside, loud music playing, brick walls, cool textured wallpaper, people chatting up storms, servers working their booties off, open kitchen by the bar where everyone is ordering burgers and based on all the reviews, I had to order a cheeseburger. And so it came, a true beauty, but a single cheeseburger actually comes with two patties, just so you know. It also comes Au Cheval with an egg on top, but I didn't want anymore cholesterol, plus eggs on top of burgers aren't really my thing. Here's my thought process on the burger, is it good? Yes, is it worth getting? Why not. But is it out of this world amazing and the best burger in Chi-Town? Not in my opinion. My husband got the omelette with blue cheese, caramelized onions and spinach and he thought it was pretty good, also not incredible. So I was going to give them 4 stars for overall being a worthy place to try out on Randolph street amongst all the big boys like girl and the goat and vivo, but here's my biggest issue with this place. We were here for brunch even though it was already 2pm and thank g-d the burger was on the menu, because otherwise I wouldn't have known what to get. Where is the fried bologna sandwich? Where was the fried chicken that everyone talks about? Why wouldn't they also have more than 5 menu items at 2pm? Come on now, brunch should be an addition, not the only stuff on the menu. However, the bloody Mary's at $10 a piece looked delish, but we weren't in a drinking mood (if that is such a thing). Will I be back? Probably not. Because I don't think a 5 item food menu list is not acceptable for such a place. People want options or at least for lunch time they do. However, if you're here for dinner, when there are options, do yourself a favor and try the Cheeseburger."
"The concept sounds awesome but the execution is missing.  Billed as a french diner with a solid beer list the lines don't justify the experience.  It was a must to try the fried bologna sandwich. It was decent, but nothing I couldn't have done at home. I enjoyed sitting at the counter watching the food be made but that's the highlight. The hype surrounding this is hype, its not worth the wait."
"Hands down, best burger in Chicago! To steal a line from How I Met Your Mother, ""I'm never brushing my teeth again, unless it's with a toothbrush made of this burger."""
"The fried chicken and burgers were amazing. The waiting list was over an hour, but the food was definitely worth the wait!"
"Had brunch here and it was fantastic.  I was a bit worried about ordering the english breakfast because the best english breakfast I have had previously was just ok.  The english breakfast here was awesome.  Baked beans were sweet and smoky.  The thick cut bacon was peppery, salty, smoky, and sweet.  Also had their blueberry muffin which was huge, light, and stuffed with fresh blueberries."
Fun atmosphere. Friendly staff. Great drinks. Excellent food. What more could one ask for? The burger with fried egg and fondue was exquisite decadence. A nighttime Bloody Mary? Why not? It was a perfect compliment to the evening.
"Good service, cool atmosphere, best burger in the city! Do yourself a favor and add bacon. Yeah, you will probably have to wait but it's worth it."
I heard they have the best burgers ever! They don't do carry out or take reservations. The guy on the phone was snobby about answering our questions so we went there... They have every right to be snobby because this was the best burger I have ever had in my life. We sat at the bar where they cook the burgers in front of you and all the cooks were personable and had such a great attitude even though it was jammed packed.  Definitely get the bacon cheeseburger with the egg on top. It was literally to die for. The French fries were phenomenal. We ordered the fried bologna sandwich as well... But don't waste your time because it wasn't half as good as the burgers. I will probably crave these burgers for the rest of my life!
"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME.While small and cramped when you first walk in, once you sit down to enjoy this amazing 'diner', all anger of having to wait longer than what the hostess told you floats away. I had the Brat with smashed potatoes. That didn't stand a chance. My fiancee feasted on the Toasted open faced ham and cheese fondue with fried egg. That was suuuper rich and so delicious! Do yourself a favor and order some fries with the garlic aioli. We can't wait to return. The burgers look too damn good."
"I headed to Au Cheval for lunch with a client one day during the week. I had heard it was hard to get a seat but I think if you go during the week and lunch it isn't too bad. I walked in at ten till noon and had a table right away. It definitely filled up, the place is teeny tiny!The service is great, the waitress really knew the menu and was very attentive. I heard they have the best burger in the city, alas, I am not really a burger person. So sue me! I got the ham and cheese fondue. It said it was an open faced sammy, but it definitely wasn't. It was delish, but totally surprised me when it came. It was texas like toast/brioche and a dish with cheese fondue (duh) topped with ham that looked like it was put under the broiler. Super yummy, but a little work to assemble and kinds messy. I'd definitely eat it again though. I don't turn down things like cheese fondue. I can't comment on the alcoholic bevies since I didn't have any, but looked like they had a good selection. Two thumbs up!"
Let me start off by saying that they have hands down the best burger in the city. My girlfriend took me there for my birthday brunch. We got lucky and the wait wasn't bad but the service and speed in which the food came out was great. I ordered their burger not knowing what to expect. I received a mound of deliciousness!! The pork belly fat and the egg on top sealed the deal. Their regular burger was more than enough food I can't even imagine how big their double burger is. I haven't tried any of their other food but it all looked delicious.
"came back for the bone marrowbaconfoie gras scrambled eggsfried house made bologna sandwichmatzah ball soupeverything is wonderful and delicious, but the best is the bologna sandwich and matzah ball soup. must come back!"
"I've been wanting to try this place out for a little over six months now. I finally got the chance to go when my roommate asked if I wanted to join her and her friends for an early dinner on a Saturday night. For an appetizer, we ordered the fries with an egg on top. I forgot what one of the sauces was, but the other was a garlic aioli, which I liked a lot. Who knew that fries with a runny egg would taste so good!Two of us shared an Au Cheval burger with a thick bacon and a sunny-side up egg. I tried a bite of this, and it was delicious. I'd have to order this the next time I come here (and hope that someone will want to share this with me OR not eat anything else for the next 24 hours; it looked THAT filling).My roommate and I shared the foie gras with pork cabbage. This was the top highlighted item on Yelp, and it was pretty good. I cannot believe that of six women, four of us did not like foie gras. What? Apparently I was with the wrong crowd, and I got lucky that my roommate was not one of them. The foie gras flavor wasn't very prominent though, so after saying this, the other women tried it too, and they liked it... So much for the foie gras...My roommate and I also shared the bone marrow dish. This was delicious too. I liked it a lot more than the foie gras and pork cabbage. It was very flavorful, unlike the aforementioned plate. The other two women shared the spicy honeyed chicken. This was good too, but I'm not that fond of it. I'm still dreaming about that burger and the fries... Mmm."
"Went on a Friday night. Double date. You know how it goes...This place was amazing. The attire was pretty dressy when we went, but the ambiance of the place made it seem very casual. The food was amazing. I was a little skeptical to pay that much for a burger, but it was soooo good. I think I devoured it in like 6 bites, as did my date, so everyone was on the same page.Would definitely go again. Only downfall was that they do not take reservations, and we waited 1.5 hours. Again, this was a Friday night at 7:30pm, so that was to be expected; however, there are a lot of amazing alternatives in the West Loop Area that have much shorter wait times."
"As perfect as perfect can be. 4.5 stars with hundreds of reviews is hard to earn, but this place deserves it so much that I was surprised it averaged to ""only"" 4 stars. The food is amazing, their beer selection is incredible, and the staff is badass. Perfect perfection."
By word of mouth we found our way to the most fabulous delicious unbeatable two patty Hamburg! I let the pleasant waitress talk me into adding an egg and quarter inch thick bacon. Oh was it worth it!! There French brewed coffee was super strong but not bitter. I will return.
"Great food, great atmosphere!  This restaurant is extremely popular, so you have to be willing to wait to be seated; however, they send a text when your table is ready, so you can wander around Randolph St. while you wait."
"Yesterday was my second visit to Au Cheval, and sure enough the experience was top notch just like the first one.I'm in the food industry (culinary consulting, analysis and marketing), so my first visit included a crew of chefs and marketers from my office.  As is typical during our culinary adventures, we ordered one of each item on the menu.  I cannot pinpoint one thing that disappointed... everything was delicious!  And the gentlemen were very pleased with the beer selection, as I was with the wine.Last night I brought my husband for the first time.  We started off with a Bloody Mary and Old Fashioned... yum!As for food, naturally he tried the burger that Au Cheval is so well-known for, added an egg to it, and sure enough enjoyed every bite.I ordered the ham fondue sandwich, but I actually received the fried bologna sandwich.  My husband and I had a good laugh because it tasted like ham so I didn't think twice as I polished off every bite of it - it was delicious.  To our surprise our awesome waitress came by to explain that our dish was mixed up, apologized profusely, and brought my original order.  Of course we tried it, and it was delicious as well!  To finish off our night we had the root beer float which was an awesome end to the night.And what great customer service - the fondue sandwich was on the house, and we received an additional discount on our order.  This of course was not expected but absolutely appreciated.  The great food and customer service ascertained there will be many, many more visits to the restaurant - especially since it's close to home.Keep up the great work!"
"Worth the long wait! We tried regular burger, hash brown with duck heart gravy, and general jane's chicken. All were delish! Typical small gastropub decor. Service was average because of crowd but that's expected for a busy place like this. Good selection for craft beer. I would definitely return on my next trip to Chicago!"
Here's my review complete with my 'carnivorous indiscretion' courtesy of that burger...feastoffashions.blogspot…
"I have always had a great experience here. Friendly staff that is generally quick/attentive (watch out for busy times though). All of the food I have had here is fantastic and the drink selection is great.Wait  can be extremely long, but you can leave your number and they will text you when the table is ready."
Awesome burger + bacon! come at an off time so you don't have a long wait.
"No words.  I have never written a 5 star review on the first visit out of principal, this is a first.If you go with 4 people here is perfect order:  two double cheeseburgers (with eggs), duck heart gravy hash, honey fried Chicken and an order of bacon. I am not kidding u better fucking do this now."
"Ok, so you walk up to Au Cheval and discover that there is a TWO HOUR WAIT to be seated. ""Why oh why is there a two hour wait for a damn bacon cheeseburger??"" BECAUSE THIS BURGER TASTES LIKE JESUS GRILLED IT WHILE WAVING AN AMERICAN FLAG. Seriously, I would let this burger date my sister. If this burger posed as a Nigerian banker trying to send money to a dear friend, I would gladly give it my account information. I will spend damn good money to fly back up here to eat it again.Let's look at the damage: A single (read two patties) cheeseburger with half inch thick bacon slabs, smothered in dijonnaise, and fries with garlic aioli.I want monuments and songs dedicated to this place. Erin, my server, was my superhero. The service is top notch, the music is on point, and people eating seemed to understand that they were taking part in a religious experience."
"I usually  avoid restaurants that don't take reservations, but my party of 2 was seated immediately at 7:30pm on a Monday night. I immediately took in the small, dark, cool atmosphere of Au Cheval and decided I was a fan. A big fan.This will be one of the first places on my list when I'm able to drink again, but for now the ""baby"" and I enjoyed a tasty mocktail. As for the food..just as good as the atmosphere and mocktail. My dining companion and I started with the poached salmon special. Salmon hasn't really been doing it for me since I got pregnant, but this was uh-mazing. I ordered the most random entrée on the menu: matzo ball soup. While a tad too salty, this soup is definitely better than any matzo ball soups I've had at the Jewish delis in Chicago. Then again that doesn't say much based on my experiences with the Jewish delis in Chicago.  To make my meal even more random my friend I shared a side of their infamous fries topped with egg and some béarnaise sauce on the side. Oh so heavenly.We left stuffed, happy and it even crossed my mind that it may be worth waiting for a table at Au Cheval."
"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Why? Unpretentious, fantastic food, in a really cool space. The foie gras terrine is served with thick Texas toast and strawberry jam.  Salty and sweet and amazing.  The fried chicken is sticky with an Asian glaze.  Crispy and juicy.  Comes with two hot hand towels to clean up.  You'll need them.  House made fried bologna sandwich is so rich and indulgent.  I always split it with a friend.  It's so so good.  Those are my favorite dishes.  You may wait a while for a table but that's what it's like at all of the nearby restaurants.  Just grab a beer somewhere and wait for them to text you.  It'll be worth it."
"Was back again, salt was contained, burger was excellent, good beer with whiskey neat, all is well."
"I came here for brunch. There was a pretty long wait, almost half an hour and since K and i were so hungry, we ate at the bar. I tried the simple breakfast and K had the scrambled eggs and pate de fois gras. I loved loved loved mine, but then again, scrambled eggs (and these were moist, with cheese and well flavoured), thick cut bacon and texan toast are foods that I consider to be at the bottom of my food pyramid. K loved her dish as well, but found it really heavy and so it had to be wrapped for her. Of course, she ate it for dinner. I will be back, since Ive never had such incredibly well made comfort food. Thanks Au Cheval!"
"We were dining at a nearby restaurant and decided to pop into Au Cheval for a nightcap. We ended up sitting at the bar and after 30 minutes of seeing burger after burger being passed off to from kitchen staff to waiters to diners, we decided to have a cheeseburger. It was the best cheeseburger in the world."
The burgers are awesome. The bone marrow dish is so delisH. The ambience is very laid back but don't be fool because everything is very good - from the drinks down to desserts are awesome.
"Literally, the most pretentious place I've ever been to. The atmosphere is cool and the music is good, but the staff suffer from some serious delusions of grandeur. For some reason, our waitress felt the need to card two people in their 40s sitting down for dinner at 5:30pm on a Monday night. My boyfriend didn't have ID on him  and when he was refused service, we asked to see the manager, who proceeded to lecture us on ""the law.""Obviously, we didn't stay. We went down the street to Girl and the Goat where they don't feel the need to behave that way.Luckily, this restaurant isn't located in NYC where the ""amazing burger"" wouldn't be any better than a million others and you'd never get away with this kind of inane posturing."
"I would rather drink Mad Dog 20/20 in a muggy cellar in the middle of summer than eat here again. Just another dimly light, overpacked hallway with a French twist and a ""mixologist"" that loves gin. ALL THE FAD.If you go out to eat and its the hour and a half wait that you seek, this is your place!The one star goes to the burger as it was delicious. However, it could have been delicious because I was ravenous by the time we sat down to eat."
"Went for Sunday brunch, fearing a long wait. The hostess, who was fantastic, said it's showing a 35 min wait, but won't likely take that long. Took our name, and got a server to bring us Bloody Mary's at the corner of the bar while we waited. Within about 5 mins, a table opened up and she sat us immediately. This is where the only downfall occurred... nobody checked on us for about 15 mins after that. But, once we ordered, everything thing came out quickly and the food was great. Very unique, casual-trendy atmosphere. I'll definitely be back for one of their burgers, which I saw being delivered to other tables. Looked excellent."
Best burger I've had in Chicago! Brioche bun with gooey cheese and super thick bacon. Fries were perfectly crisp and seasoned with spectacular garlic aoli on the side. We sat at the bar and watched the magic happen. Excellent service too.
"Both food and ambiance are awesome! I wish the accepted reservations, I would be a regular.  Burgers and fries are both really good. General Jane's Chicken is Amazing! Love that the DJ (who is very good) is also the host.  A Chicago dining must."
"Went here couple of weeks ago, always think the food is great based upon my friends words and interactions. Brought my partner, our server was great, recommended the vegetarian options for myself. It was a great experience. My partner didn't enjoy receiving three pattys when he only ordered two, made the burger very difficult to eat but tasted fantastic. Overall, much much better service quality and the food is still delicious af."
"Came here for brunch to skip the hour and a half wait at Little Goat.My friend and I split the cheeseburger (with added bacon since it was National Bacon Day) and the duck heart gravy hash.First, the hash-amazing.  It was rich, but not nearly as much as I expected.  I always thought duck heart would be rather tough, but the pieces I ate were very tender-you would never think you wear eating heart if nobody told you otherwise.  Paired with a runny egg....fantastic.Now, the burger.  I'm not normally a big fan of red meat, and tend to be biased towards Canadian beef, but my friend really wanted to try it.  The burger was delicious (although too filling for me with the double patty-I only ended up eating one), but what really got me was the bacon.  Oh, the bacon-thick cut and maple glazed.  I could have done without the double beef patties and just eaten a bacon burger instead.Don't go here for brunch if you need to do any sort of activity afterwards."
"For me it's one thing that makes this place superb. It's their cheeseburger! Oh boy. Reasons this burger is my favorite of all time is because it not to fancy but done just right! It is absolutely delicious and causes cravings for me.I love to pair this with their Smashed potatoes & roasted garlic gravy. Quite possibly the best mashed potatoes I have ever had! Their fries are pretty solid as well!Finishing the meal with their Mille feuille desert really just caps it off. 3 layers of the most excellent french pasty with some concoction of cream between the 3 layers. Words can't really do the justice, so I am gonna have to let you guys try it as well!"
"*Brunch Review - if I could round up I would give this place 4.5 stars. I went with my best friend, and because of our indecisiveness (fatty'ness) we ended up ordering 3 entrees for 2 people.1. Chilaquiles - my friend had been before, and this is his favorite dish, so he insisted we get this one. I liked it a lot, but of the 3 dishes it was probably my least favorite. It's not that the dish wasn't good, it's just that the other two dishes blew me out of the water. Also, I tend to gravitate towards heavier, butter-laden dishes (which explains my affinity for French food), this dish was packed with unique and fresh ingredients, but was not as heavy as what I usually go for. 2. Au Cheval Burger - Since we ordered 3 dishes for just us 2, I decided to forgo the addition of an egg and bacon. This burger was a hot greasy mess (in a very good way). I don't think there is anything better in this world than eating a burger and having all of the meat juices roll down your arms. One of the better burgers I have had, and that is saying a lot, since I hail from the land of beef and burgers (Texas).3. Duck Heart Gravy Hash - now you're talking. This dish was everything I love about food, rich, creamy, and unique. Some may not be on the organ-eating wagon, but being Asian, it is like second nature to me. I love me some heart, now cook that heart in a butter-laden gravy, and pour it over perfectly crisp hash browns and top it off with a perfectly cooked egg (that you pierce and the rich yolk oozes out), I'm a goner. All I have to say is that even though I was suffering from not even just a food baby, but food triplets, I would happily suffer through it again for this food."
"Great burgers! My boyfriend was told this place has the best burgers in the city, so we went to check them out.  They shut down the kitchen from 3-5p, we arrived at 4p so we had to leave and come back. This place is extremely small, so we couldn't wait around. We came back around 4:30 and was seated right away. Our waiter was very attentive and gave great recommendations. I'm all for trying new things, but this menu was very different from anything I'm accustom to, so we stuck with the burgers.  I had a single cheeseburger with a fried egg, (fyi-the single is actually two hamburger patties) my hunny had the double cheeseburger with a fried egg and bacon ( which was like 3 patties, go figure), and a order of fries.  Our burgers were cooked perfectly, juicy and well seasoned. Only thing I didn't care much for was the bacon, it was extremely thick and reminded you more of a slice of Thanksgiving Ham, than crispy bacon.  But that wasn't a deal breaker, I was very pleased with the burger overall.  We had a great experience, I probably wouldn't want to go back just because the menu selections were very limited."
"Came here on the recommendation of a friend who knows a thing or two about burgers.  I have to say, this place held up despite the massive amount of hype it received.I started with two very good beers--they have a great selection.  The bartender (I didn't catch his name) was constantly trying to give us samples of any beer he could suggest.  It made for a great experience, and it probably prompted us to order appetizers while waiting for a table.I got the marrow.  Holy #@%$# it was good.  The beef cheek marmalade was good enough to eat on its own, and everything was perfect (for lack of a better word).The burger does not need much explaining.  It was the best burger I've ever had and I could eat it every day.  It's probably a good thing I don't live within 2000 miles of this place.  Get it with the bacon, and don't look back."
5 stars all day. Best burger in Chicago. I realized during my last visit that the burger is actually better with the egg but without the addition of the bacon (get it on the side).
Go for the Matzah Ball soup! It will be like you are home with your bubbe! The honey fried chicken was incredible as well! I love that they give you the proper wet naps for this messy meal but you will be licking your fingers because the sauce is that good!
"My 100th review, and I am SO GLAD it is for Au Cheval. I can't believe it took me this long to go try what I had read about 20 different publications praise as the best burger in not only Chicago, but in AMERICA. They don't take reservations and we had an hour and a half wait on a Friday night but it was absolutely worth every minute. They will text you when your table is ready, so we headed over to Holiday Bar & Grill for a few drinks and some bar peanuts which was an easy way to pass the time. Now the burger. I wish I could accurately describe it, but I don't think any words will do it justice. While I do love a big, juicy patty - the Single Cheeseburger consists of two thinner patties and it works beautifully. The perfect amount of cheese, perfectly melted, and a buttery bun that traps every morsel so that your plate is completely bare. No dripping or juicing or losing any flavor, perfection. I got it with no egg, and added bacon. This was my only regret, but it was one I corrected after a few bites. The bacon is super thick cut, which is full-flavor and tasty on its own, but I didn't want the saltiness of the bacon to over-power the beef. Once I took the bacon off, it was seriously perfect. The fries were just as dreamy as the burger, and I love a good garlic aioli. The wine is a generous pour, and the servers are great. Tables are a little close but I enjoyed that, we talked with our neighbors who were talking with their neighbors and it added a nice social-vibe. It's also a great way to check out what other people are ordering and find out how it is without being an annoying looky-lou. We got the corner table in the back which was nice and romantic, if I could pick any seat in the house it would have been that one! I cannot wait to be back, and I cannot wait to have visitors so I have an excuse to indulge in the best burger I've ever tasted again soon."
Best burger on the planet PERIOD!My wife loves hers with egg. I like mine straight up!
"I love this place, and I make sure I come here every time I visit Chicago for the following reasons:- Best burger I had in my life!- Excellent cocktails- Nice servers- The music selection is one of the best house music collections I heard in so long!- Not too loud, not too trendy, and not pretentious. Simple a perfect ambiance!"
"Wow, that's a good burger.  Get it with the egg for sure, the bacon is amazing itself, but it's just sooooooo thick, it's like adding a 3rd patty on the burger.  Great beers on tap and fun music too.  I'll be back here fo sho."
"MMM mmmm goood, Au Cheval.My husband and I dined here a couple weeks back. I think we went at the perfect time...right around 5:30 and were able to avoid a wait (Au Cheval does not take reservations and gets packed up pretty quickly).The menu isn't the biggest, but if you're a meat lover, there's definitely something on there for you. We had heard great praise for the burgers, so we each got one. (Don't get the double, unless you're starving. It comes with THREE patties!!). As well, we got duck heart gravy hash, since the burgers are served a la carte. Let me tell you, we didn't need the hash...the burgers were juicy, cooked to perfection and so, so good. Best burger I've had in years.The hash was decadent with even a hint of sweetness. I felt it was something we had to try, since neither of us had had duck heart gravy before and we both LOVE duck. The hash was crispy and perfectly accented the gravy. So yummy!Service was polite and timely. If you're a beer drinker, you may not mind the wait...because they have quite a selection!"
"What fun. Had the pleasure of sitting at the bar and was able to watch the kitchen and the bartender zip around. Never knew how they prepared bone marrow and mille feuille until here! Great environment with the open bustling kitchen. Came here for drinks and desert after dinner down the block. Absolutely packed on a Friday night but managed to have our order taken quickly. Solid beer and wine list, and from the plates of food around us, the food looked incredible as well. Burgers aplenty! We sampled various artisanal craft brews and glasses of red and moved on to our own mille feulle for dessert, crispy phyllo pasty layed with MOUNDS of rich cream. From the burgers to the foie to the creamy deserts, leave your healthy eating at the door! This is the place to enjoy food. The dessert was delicious and could easily feed a table of people! Would love to return for brunch or a full dinner (I'm eyeing you, cheeseburger heaven)."
"This place sucks. The menu is limited and some of the dishes, such as the honey chicken - the description makes it sound like you get a ton of food when in reality it's really small pieces. I had the burger, and it was way too greasy and pretty much raw. They put some kind of dijonnaise on there, I thought I was going to get a stomach ache from how greasy and fattening it was. I did not eat it all. Then I order a side of their pickle salad and the waiter failed to tell me that they were sweetened, so that was disgusting as well. The fries are definitely not the best I have tried, they are mediocre. The only good thing here, is the beer. That is it. The food is a catastrophe, not to mention how the place looks inside, but I would not expect better from a cheap bar I guess. Advice: Drinks only."
"Bit pricey for a plain cheeseburger (you have to pay extra for the egg and bacon) when you could get an equally good one that includes all the perks down the block at Little Goat Diner; however, the burger was delicious, perhaps a bit too heavy with the fat and oil.  Make sure to sop up all the goodness at the end!  I suppose it was worth the hour and a half wait to see what the hype was about.  Also - the single is two burger patties, and the double is three."
Simply the best burger I've had in years. Great bloody Mary's with beer chasers. Ask for Kira - she's the best
"Okay...what can I possibly add to the raves here...exactly...nothing! The marrow bones are ridiculous, perfectly roasted and served with buttery thick toast points and a nice fruit compote. The chicken liver app is well prepared with a nice fresh dill and just enough creamy mayo to bind. For dinner we split the crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy, the cheese burger with fried egg and an order of the fries with moray and aioli. Wow, can you hear my arteries screaming as I type? The crispy hash and duck heart gravy is so rich...the fried shredded potatoes serving as the ultimate foil to the duck stew. The cheeseburger is awesome, well-seasoned and cooked to perfection...needs the delicious addition of a fried egg...not...but highly recommended! The fries with Mornay and aioli caps off the dinner deliciously. We even attempted dessert, a double scoop of ice cream served with warm chocolate sauce. One scoop of chocolate and one scoop of the best mint ice cream ever (fresh, subtle and not that funky artificial green color), a refreshing end to a great dining experience. I can't wait to find myself back in Chicago lining up for a repeat! Thanks Au Cheval!"
"We walked in on a Sunday night and grabbed two seats at the bar right away - the hostess told us it would be a half hour wait and I pointed at the empty seats and asked for it, she said go right ahead. I felt bad for the other people who were waiting outside but oh well, I wasn't gonna be nice and give up the seats right away. I usually prefer bar seats especially if I am dining with just another person anyway. We ordered a green salad, fries with eggs, and a burger. The food came out really fast, and I could see the cooks working away non-stop from my seat, I throughout enjoyed it. The salad was alright, a little too salty I think, and they relied heavily on the dressing. The bacon that came with it was good at first bite, but after a little bit I couldn't finish it. It was too greasy for me. The burger and fries were both good. I had half of the single burger and he helped me finish it. The fries, again, were really greasy and salty, both of which made it amazing at first but a little gross by the end. I thought the flavoring were excellent, they should just use less salt. For desert, we had the root beer float, which were really good. The bartender was kind enough to give us a little stout to go with it - weird I know but delish - made the float a little less sweet hence better for me! Service was good. Our server was nice, and the bartender was very friendly. Nothing to complain here. I also love the atmosphere although I left smelling a little oily. But I can totally see why this place sells. Affordable good food with some trendy options in a cool and limited space - people totally fall for it! Heck I did too! I'd give it a try, although I'm not sure I was crazy about it enough to come back again and again!"
"If you like to eat and you haven't been here, shame on you.Best dinner I've had in quite a while, unequivocally. Drinks were fantastic as well.Well done Mr. Sodikoff, you've done it again.The burger, really is that good. The honey fried chicken is a must. Potato hash is to die for."
"Best meal I've had in Chicago, hands down. Great staff, food, drinks, ambiance, everything.We ended up trying to get a table on a Saturday night around 830pm. Probably the worst possible time one could attempt to get a table at a busy restaurant. They took our name down, quoted us 1.5hrs, and we headed across the street to Haymarket for some beers. After 1.5hrs we stopped back, and they said it would be about another half hour. So after getting another round at the Au Cheval bar, we were in, in about 2hrs time.Our group of 4 decided to split everything so we could get a taste of as many dishes as possible. We ended up splitting the fries(with egg), tuna(with egg), bacon cheeseburger(with egg), sausage with mashed potatoes, and bone marrow.It is hard to pick out what the ""best"" dish was. The burger was out of this world. I thought that I had eaten good burgers before, but it was a masterpiece. Each bite was full of flavors. It was quite intense, so eating a whole burger might be difficult for most. I would recommend sharing if possible. The bone marrow was a new experience for me, but very very tasty. Essentially you scooped the marrow(fat) out of the bones, and spread it on bread. It was pretty amazing.The service was top notch. They stopped back often to refill the water, and check on us. We all had drinks the entire time, and never had to search for someone to bring us anything. They were friendly and very nice to us as well.Overall, if you can handle the wait, the experience is very very worth it. The food is excellent and I can't wait to stop back again when I am in town!"
"I don't understand what all the excitement is about. The burger was just OK and I've certainly had better fries. I also found the menu to be quite limited. If I'm in the mood for a burger and fries, which I often am, then I'll definitely be heading someplace else."
"The atmosphere is outstanding.  Low lighting, good music, and top notch service.  The food here is heavy and may lead to a food coma.  They don't take reservations, but you can give the host/hostess your cell phone number and kill some time having drinks across the street at Haymarket or a couple doors down at Lone Wolf while you wait for your table to be ready.I never realized a cheeseburger could be so. . . gourmet.  The cheeseburgers come as a standard double burger and the 'double burger' is actually a triple.  Keep this in mind.  This is the number 1 cheeseburger in Chicago.  It makes Kuma's look like a pig in a prom dress.The bologna sandwich is a must try.  It's actually a house made mortadella fried up and covered in cheese on a brioche bun.  It's unlike any bologna sandwich that I ever carried to school in my Rambo lunchbox.  The chilaquiles, which are only served after midnight, are delicious and HUGE.  Definitely good for sharing, unless you're in the mood to down a plate of chips, guacamole, onion, cilantro, jalapeno, sour cream, and egg on your own.  The scrambled eggs with foi gras gravy on toast is decadent.  That could easily be a meal in itself.  A great spot for a date or a casual dinner.  Please don't bring children here.  They'll ruin the atmosphere."
"If you want to feel like you're in any number of sketches from Portlandia (Brunch most notably comes to mind) , this is the place to go.  Now, did I enjoy myself there?  Receive good service, eat good food?  Sure.  But....Does a burger with nothing else start at $10?  YesDo they ask if you'd like to add egg or bacon, which are $4 and $8 respectively, without mentioning an added cost (which, yes, I inferred, but did not expect at that price)? YesDoes a place with an amazing burger have absolutely terrible fries? Yes (it's just wrong....three of us shared one order and had some left bc they were just so blah)Does the place not take reservations and have over a 2 hour wait? Yes.  Good for them, and somehow I'm ok w/ the wait at Kuma's, but I didn't feel it was worth it here)Ultimately, having experienced it once, I can say I've tried it and enjoyed it well enough but I'm quite certain I will not return.  As far as recommending it to others, it would be hard to pick this place with so many other places available in the city.  Also, I feel like my review sounds like I'm cheap, but I'm all about spending a pretty penny if I feel like it was worth it.  $6 for fries worse than fast food is not breaking my bank, but also not worth it.To summarize the food: single cheeseburger w/ egg, yummy.  fries, some of the worst.  the puff pastry/cream dessert (forgetting the name), alright.  (And yes, my order was conservative to the large selection of items they had, but they had a good burger rep so I went simple)"
"Au Cheval has an incredible reputation. Everyone knows about the burgers, and the long wait times. Luckily every time I have tried Au Cheval we have had no wait, go early. The burgers are absolutely amazing, my favorite burger in the city. It is a basic classic burger that is done to perfection, no need for fancy toppings.  The fries, duck heart hash, and other sides are decadent companions for the burger. The beer list is top notch including Abraxas on tap last time we were there. I definitely recommend coming here for the burger even if you have to wait."
"The wait is long, but they give you a call on your cell when your table is ready.  Which is great because you can walk over to Lone Wolf for a cocktail.  The food is good.  A little over-priced.  West Loop is just like that though.We had the Burger with egg and the Foie Gras and scrambled eggs.  Quite tasty and very rich.  It's good for a one-time experience."
"If it weren't for the fairly prominent ""Au Cheval"" sign out front, it'd be very easy to walk by this unassuming establishment.  For whatever reason, the Randolph-facing wall is basically covered wood (i.e. no windows).  Let's just say it felt a LITTLE sketch walking in at first...and it was 2pm on a Friday!You get inside and it's a nice, legit bar with a wine cellar-ish feel to it.  You peek at the menu and you realize it's a great gastropub - if you didn't come here first.I had the burger with egg and bacon, and it was MANLY.  Share some fries with a friend and you've got yourself a full lunch.Definitely the best burger I've had in Chicago thus far, although I haven't tried them all!Stay classy,E"
"We went to Au Cheval yesterday for lunch with my daughter.  We arrived at 1:30pm on a very snowy day, and there was still a 30 minute wait.  ""Au Cheval"" is noted for its hamburgers and bologna sandwich.  We ordered both, and they were good, but not the best we've ever had.  What annoyed us was the loud music.  It was not background music, but so loud we could hardly hear each other talk.  The decibel level was anti-conversation.  I wonder if they do this on purpose to turn the tables over more quickly.  We asked the host twice to lower the music, but he declined.  In short, the food was ok, but don't go if you actually wish to converse with your friends."
"We waited an hour at the bar next store and it was worth the wait!  The burgers with egg and bacon were great. Even my fiancé liked them and she doesn't like that stuff on her burger. Fries were really good, too!"
Their single is a double and the double is a TRIPLE! that being said their food was purty good.... not the best burger in the city but its really really good. The wait was about 1.5 hours on a thursday around 6:30 (which i kinda expected) so be prepared.  Great homemade pickles ;)edit: oh shit i almost forgot about how amazingly thick their bacon was too.
"AMAZING!!!  The old-fashioned was absolutely delicious, as was everything else.  One of the places you MUST go to.  I only wish it was bigger so that the wait wasn't always so long."
"This review is for brunch which is really delicious. Fois gras, scrambled eggs, toast with homemade jam- yes it was decadent and yes my tummy is smiling. Service was excellent and Alex- the bartender makes killer drinks.  Will definitely return to check out the dinner menu."
"We had a fantastic time at Au Cheval! Both, my husband and I had the burger with bacon (huge), crispy fries with egg on top to share, a couple of cocktails and a espresso/cappuccino to end the meal. I don't even care for burgers usually but this one is delicious. I hope you have a chance to visit them and enjoy their food and atmosphere as much as we did!"
"Everything about this place is great. Starting with the beer list and ending with the simple yet delicious burgers. While the resturaunt is quite small, the environment and ambiance is great on the inside. Be sure to get there early for either lunch or dinner because it fills up quick and your almost guaranteed to have a wait. Overall a must visit in the city."
Au Cheval is one of the best restaurants on Randolph Street. Their food is really good.
"This is hands down the best place we ate while in Chicago. Bacon, bone marrow and foie gras. All were cooked to perfection. Our server was great very good with the menu. Also love the reel to reel player pumping out the tunes. This place is a can't miss."
"Favorite burger of all-time!  Nice atmosphere, usually pretty crowded though."
"I've been here several times - the burgers live up to the hype.  This is the place I take out-of-towners to get a great Chicago burger.Recommendations:1.  Get the cheeseburger. The double is not necessary, as there is plenty of beef in the regular.2.  The fries with the two side sauces and the fried egg on top.3.  Side of bacon.  ""Bacon"" doesn't adequately describe what you get, it is more like an awesome pork steak. =)4.  Tap beer selection is solid.A bit on the pricy side, but worth it.  There isn't a lot of seating, so if you don't get there right at opening for lunch or off-hours, be prepared to wait for quite awhile."
"Have been trying to come to this place for a while to get the great cheese burger I have heard so much about. Walk in at 2 and try to put our name in and the hostess replies ""Ha not happening..."" Pretty rude..we asked why and she said the kitchen would be closing before we could get seated and it ""wasnt gonna happen"" for us. Pretty rude for a first impression. We also were walking out and she yelled at us to hurry and shut the door because we were letting the heat out. Luckily Little Goat was happy to seat us and serves breakfast all day .Not sure I want to even try to come back here after the hostess was so rude."
"I'm a huge fan of Brendan Sodikoff and his successful restaurant empire. So maybe I was a little bias before going to Au Cheval but what can I say, it's another hit in our books.Before that, it was hard for me to conceptualize Au Cheval just based on reading about it. Diner? A fancy/high-class diner? Yes, Au Cheval is just that. That place is small so I can imagine the frustration with wait times. That's also a big reason why my husband and I took so long to check out Au Cheval despite living a stone's throw away. But we finally went one night and lucked out as we only waited for about 25 mins. We were seated at the counter which was all the better for us as we got to see the chefs preparing and cooking the food. Au Cheval must have some really high tech ventilation system. The place is small and just like a diner, the kitchen, grill, and stove are just right there with all the rich foods being prepared and cooked. Despite that, there was no hint of a smell of grease at the place like what you would expect from a diner or restaurant with that small of a space with an open kitchen.The food items are rich so be sure to pace yourself when ordering. We ordered too much for the both of us. We loved everything we ordered though. The salmon rilette was on special and it came with a quail egg on top. It was fantastic and even the toast itself was addictive. Who doesn't like salads with bacon? The caesar salad was brought up a notch with the bacon. We had side of extra bacon (we love pork) and it was charred to perfection with a slightly sweet caramelized taste. The bratwurst with smashed potatoes were also very good.Another fabulous restaurant of Brendan Sodikoff with a nice quaint vibe. Of course we'll be back."
"Au Che-what?! Au Cheval!Came here with a friend that was in town (currently living in India) and this was a perfect place for a nice, casual dinner to catch up. I started out with a Hemingway Daquiri, which was really good. They had a special appetizer that day, and it was amazing. A salmon with creme fraiche (which I had never had before) and that alone was really great, but these serve it with this toast that was to die for. It reminded me of  the typical bagel and lox but exceptionally elevated. This was my favorite.Then we ordered the general tso's chicken. This was good, and a large serving. For some reason I felt the need to order fries, so we got the crispy fries served with mornay sauce and garlic aioli and a fried egg on top. I really liked going back and forth from the mornay to the aioli. Deelish. We shared all of the plates we ordered, and to be honest it was so much food that we ended up boxing some of it. I can't wait to go back here and try something else. I'm hoping that they will have some different specials since I'm drooling just thinking about the one I tried before.Side-note: unexpected music selection, but it was cool."
The great burger debate rages on.  Went here with my girlfriend and the host said it would be an hour and a half so we got a drink across the street.  The host called at about that time and we walked over.  I ordered the double burger with bacon.  Note that a double burger is way too much burger unless you are very hungry.  I love Kumas but this is a different sort of burger.  This is just about the only burger I could imagine eating with bread and bun and being completely satisfied.  Amazing.
"I had heard of their amazing burgers so when I had a free lunch in West Loop I made my way over to give it a try.First of all I loved the feel of the place. It had a great ambiance, and I loved being seated at the bar to observe the food as it was being prepared. I ordered a ""single"" burger and french fries. I loath overcooked beef with a burning passion stronger than an exploding sun, and there were a few tense moments when I thought those thin patties may be on for a second too long. I should have had more faith. The burger came out with two perfect patties a vibrant pink inside. Best cooked burger I've had in the city. And the fries were no slouch either. I could dip anything in that garlic aioli.The reason that I'm giving Au Cheval 4 stars instead of 5 was unfortunately the service. It was fine at the start of the meal but my waitress clearly forgot about me after I got my food. I saw her bring checks to many other patrons while I waited and finally had to flag someone down to get my check.I would come back for another one of those burgers. Only next time I'll bring a friend or a book so I have something to occupy myself in case I get forgotten again."
"Au Cheval - you had me at foie gras & scrambled eggs. Stopped here for brunch with friends during a recent visit to Chi-town and was not disappointed! The service was friendly, the ambiance and decor somewhat of a mix of upscale diner and throwback prohibition bar. The coffee (it was brunch after all) was delicious (illy?), the garlic aioli fries with farm egg on top = seriously addictive, and I wanted to cry when I finished my plate of foie scrambled eggs. And seriously contemplated licking the plate. It was that good."
"So this place is pretty fantastic and I would give it five stars in a second if they did my burger medium rare but they insisted on medium. I've had my burgers medium rare since forever and every chef I have ever met insists on medium rare so I was pretty surprised when they wanted the burger medium which made it kinda dry and crunchy. Yet this is suppose to be the best burger around. Mmmm. no. It's good but...is more upscale burger king. Obviously Chicago hasn't hopped on the Umami, Father's Office LA train yet. I am not a fan of LaLaLand but there are a few things they get right and the burger is one of them. Umami is coming to Chitown and 25 degrees is already here and they do a damn good burger. The foie gras, the decor, the music, the fries all get 5 stars but please let me order my burger medium rare. I will be back, such a great vibe and yummmm, foie gras."
This is the second best burger that I've ever had. (Goldyburger's in Forest Park is better). The bacon is as thick as ham. The runny eggs add to the deliciousness. One order of fries is plenty to share. Our server was attentive and knowledgable about the menu.
"The burger at Au Cheval doesn't disappoint. A favorite of Bon Appetit's, it really is just close to perfect. Add the fries with fried egg and mornay sauce and you've got a near perfect meal. The atmosphere is cute though a bit tight, not cramped. The bloody mary was a great presentation with bread and butter pickles but a bit sweet for my liking. bonappetit.com/recipes/a…"
"Oh Au Cheval, why must you be located so far away from me?  I just happened upon this place by accident while stumbling around chicago with my girlfriends in search of ice cream and drinks.  It must have been just after midnight and the place was PACKED with people all looking to get an ""after the bar"" meal.  We squeezed in to one of the only open tables and proceeded to order drinks and ice cream until the guy sitting next to us insisted that we order the homemade bologna sandwich.  Okay - ice cream and bologna it is!  He also highly recommended the burger, but we were still full from dinner several hours before.  Well, it is safe to report that the bologna didn't disappoint and the ice cream was divine (yes, we ordered a scoop of all 3 flavors with hot fudge!).  I wish we had had bigger appetites because the fried chicken looked amazing, the fries, the burgers, etc.  Another table insisted that we taste their hashbrowns and they sent over a portion of theirs to taste - WOW! - make no mistake, those are some serious hashbrowns!  I just loved the vibe, the culture, the ""on-top-of your-neighbors"" table setup.  It was dark, sexy and friendly.  If I lived in Chicago, I would certainly be a regular!"
"Really? I feel like one of the very few who was hugely disappointed with this place. My husband and I live a few blocks away and had been wanting to try the infamous fried bologna sandwich for a minute but just hadn't made it over at a non-peak time. First, our waitress was....rude?! I wish that was the word I was looking for. I mean, she said maybe 5 words the entire time, didn't crack the slightest hint of a smile and just generally acted like it was biggest chore to even attend to us. Gross.So whatever, we were still stoked for our sammy. I mean, I'm from the south and I can both prepare and inhale a mean fried bologna sandwich. So, that being said...I thought this sandwich was more like a BAD version of an Arby's Beef N' Cheddar than a gourmet, inspired, new-take-on-an-old-classic fried bologna sandwich. I mean, the bologna was soggy and piled high with a pretty underwhelming cheese sauce poured all over it, not crisp at all and just....there. The matzo ball soup was decent but not really firm enough and kinda salty.I guess having high hopes for a place makes it difficult for it to live up to? Whatever it is, I won't be giving this place any more business. I prefer good food and good service and there are plenty of other great restaurants on Randolph that deliver just that. Holla!"
"Another great addition to Restaurant Row, right at the corner of Halsted and Randolph. The wait can be long, so either get here early or be prepared to wait an hour plus and maybe kill time by drinking at Haymarket across the road, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The food is extremely heavy, so order carefully. First, some comments about the food:Cheeseburger - there are many great burgers in Chicago (DMK, Bad Apple, Kuma's), and Au Cheval might hold the top spot. Get it with a generous slab of bacon on top. Double griddle patty (my personal preference, over single thick patty) with American cheese, pickle, and mustard that together make for a near-perfect dirty ole burger. Love it.Bologna Sandwich - pretty tasty, stacked high, extremely heavy, very salty.Honey-Fried Chicken - sweet, sticky, delicious. Big dish, best for a table of four.Bone Marrow - accompanying beef cheek marmalade gives this a huge edge. Toast is also surprisingly good.Potato Hash with Duck Heart Gravy - crunchy hash with rich gravy. Very tasty, another dish that is best if shared.Mashed Potatoes with Gravy - an unnecessary order, given how heavy everything else is. Gravy is thin and a little bland.Beer - draft beer selection is usually excellent and always extensive. Some offerings are rare but expensive; a single glass can even exceed the price of your burger.Service - straightforward, perfectly fine. The wait can be long, especially at peak hours, but that's what you should expect when a place is popular and small in size.Summing up, all of the food I've tried is delicious, but every item is a huge bomb as well. You will be very full by the end of it, and maybe not feeling very good about yourself. In my opinion, it's worth the occasional visit. I give it 5 stars, but just don't go very often."
Is it really the best burger in the world? I don't know I haven't had them all but I can't sleep sometimes I crave this one so much! Only thing: if u come anywhere between 6 and 10 prepare to WAIT until u grow old ! And possibly die ! Come after ten and get some late night munchies oh to be drunk right now and stuff my face ! Ps: the rest of the grub is just as good the bologna made me weep.
"DAT CHEESEBURGERReally I want to do is write that over and over and have that be the entirety of my review but I feel that would be doing this place a huge disservice. I'll get to the rest of the things that are great about this place but first let's talk about that cheeseburger.If I had to make a list of best things I've ever eaten, the cheeseburger here would be near the top of that list. If I were making a list of best diner style burgers I've ever eaten, the one here would be so far up I don't think it can ever be topped. Granted, I've never been served a diner style burger prepared so beautifully, with an egg, and half inch thick bacon, but it did come with all of those things so all other arguments against it will fall upon deaf ears for me. It is quite simply cheeseburger nirvana. Evidently I am not alone in this line of thinking either. A quick search online will show a torrent of accolades from places like Bon Appetit naming this one of if not the best burger in the nation. It really is worthy of all the hype. Burgers aren't all this place has going for it though. The theme of the place is great, the bar stock is commendable, the draft beer selection is excellent, and the breakfast cocktails are rad. I had a Rittenhouse rye Carpano Antica egg concoction that was simply out of this world. Who serves 100 proof rye and sweet vermouth in the morning? This crazy ass place does and let me tell you, it's delicious. Another fun thing to do here is just sit at the bar and watch the staff at work. The kitchen is open and hot line is just a few feet from the bar so you can watch everything being made right in front of you. This also might be a bad thing though because you have to watch all the mouth watering dishes that you didn't order roll by. Everything served here looks so delicious, it's like gluttony paradise. This is my new favorite place in all of Chicago. The next time I am back this will be my first morning meal, and probably every visit hereafter."
"Yay, I finally got to go to Au Cheval!This really is more of a dive bar with an extensive menu than it is a diner. At least that's the feel I got of it. We were quoted a 30-45 minute wait, which turned out to be less than ten minutes because we opted for bar seating. (Which also gives you the theater of watching the kitchen.) I had the bologna sandwich with egg on top and my companion had the burger with bacon, and we agreed to split our sandwiches so we could each enjoy both of them. I also had the green salad. The salad was a perfect starter salad, in that it was very simple, just mixed greens with a few shallots and the perfect amount of light vinaigrette. They heap in the bowl so high they have to put a plate under it because it's going to fall out while you're eating it.Then the sandwiches came out. Ohhhh, baby.I took a bite of this thin-sliced bologna with egg, cheese and some sort of mayo on a bun and immediately regretted that I agreed to share. I am not exaggerating at all when I say this was the best bologna sandwich I have ever, ever eaten. Oscar Mayer can't even sit in the shadow of this sandwich.Then the burger. I have to back up for a minute and talk about the bacon on the burger. The bacon is what seems to be a ridiculously expensive add-on. When my companion ordered it, he asked our server for a description. She described it as very thick-cut and maple-glazed. While she made it sound good, she just did it a major disservice. She should have bowed her head, lit a candle and given it a moment of silence. It was not thick-sliced bacon; it was thin-sliced smoked and cured pork belly, and it was phenomenal. I pulled it off the burger and ate it by itself. The burger was damn good too. In fact, my companion said that he had but into it and was sorry he'd suggested we share! Where'd we hear that before?So yeah, long wait, noisy and crowded, expensive for burger on bologna, but 100% worth it and any return visits!"
"First things first, the waitress stabbed me in the back with a knife. Literally. Stabbed me. In the back. With a knife. I was bleeding when I got home. As far as I'm concerned that is unacceptable waitress to customer behavior, so beware of errant knives in the hands of irresponsible waitresses. She did apologize a few times but did not offer a free drink or discount.Aside from that, this place is hog heaven (or hell if you happen to be a pig). Me being a vegetarian, there weren't many options.  I opted for the grilled cheese, which was ok. My meat loving companions said everything else was pretty good.  The beer list was decent. I will not be giving this place a 2nd chance, for fear I leave bloody again."
"In my pantheon of cheeseburger champions, Au Cheval's single cheeseburger stands along side Shake Shack's Shack Double atop all others. I have no qualms about naming this the best burger in Chicago.What's good: Everything from the roll, to the patty, beef blend, seasoning, cooking method, doneness, and toppings. What you get is a perfectly balanced flavor bomb. Salty, beefy, cheesy goodness cut with a piquant blend of mustard and mayo with some diced onions and a well toasted bun thrown in for texture. Everything is perfectly proportioned to one another. You can add bacon and egg (Au Cheval style) but it really detracts from the solidity that is this burger. I strangely love that the single is a double and that the double is a triple.What's not: Service could be a little more attentive. And the front of the house can be a little off-putting. Be prepared to be quoted an hour and a half wait, only to receive a call from them 15-20 minutes later. This has happened more often than not. That being said, the best experience is late (after 10pm or so) or a late Saturday lunch. Sit at the bar and marvel at the artisans working the flat top slinging what are the best burgers in the city with precision."
"This place was great. I read an article about the best burger in every state and this place did not disappoint. It has this old school rustic diner feel and I imagine is always packed, but the service and food was still timely and great. If you can sit at the diner counter or bar and you get included in all the action. We had the bone marrow with beef cheek marmalade and toast, this was a first for me and delicious. Also had the fries with an egg and the best garlic aioli ever. Lastly, the burger, it deserves it's best in the state title. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties, tender, juicy and cooked to perfection, comes with good cheese on it and of course add an egg and/or bacon. Another great thing was they don't nitpick about things, ask for extra toast they yell at the grill and throw it on, extra aioli, no problem. The expo even gave us a free scoop of malted vanilla gelato which was amazing as well. If your in Chicago, or the state of Illinois for the matter...make it here"
Cool place and the chefs looked like they were enjoying what they were doing and food looked great. Only thing is they have a very short menu until 3pm which I'm not a fan of but overall very cool.
"The burger is amazing.  Get it ""Au Cheval style"" with bacon and an egg on top.  The bacon is soft enough to where it breaks off when you bite into the burger.  The egg is cooked to perfection.  The patty is amazing.  It's easily the best ""normal"" burger I've ever had.Their beer selection is average-sized but fantastic.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive.  Au Cheval is one of those places where I always take someone if they've never been.I tend to arrive here before noon if I'm grabbing lunch or right when they start serving after their afternoon break.  The place quickly fills up."
"We had stopped in for drinks with friends awhile ago and wanted to get something small as an appetizer before we headed out for more drinks and eventually dinner later on.  The friends were not so adventurous so we settled on the fries with the fried egg... why are all things not served covered in egg?Either way, I finally got a chance to come back and give the menu the attention it deserved with a couple more adventurous friends.  We had...- Foie Gras Terrine with Jelly and toast: can that guy come make me toast on the weekends?  How is it so evenly buttered and toasted to perfection?  The foie was super rich and the strawberry jelly was sweet and the best complement.  This is grown up toast right here my friends.- Crispy Fries with Egg: I mean, don't fix what ain't broke.  The garlic aioli is the best with egg and fried potatoes.- Raw Veggie Salad: Beets and carrots and onions and cilantro and a light dressing.  Crunchy and fresh, could have used more of the blue cheese/goat cheese/whatever cheese to cut the vinegar taste but it was a good course to make me not feel like I was just stuffing more and more artery clogging goodness into my mouth.- Fried Chicken: more Asian than I would have expected, sweet and spicy and sticky and crispy.  I loved it and should have stopped at one piece but I went for a second anyways.- Fried Bologna Sandwich: I'll be honest, I was ready to pass this one up.  The only experience I have with fried bologna is from a friend's house when I was about eight and it was some Oscar Mayer thrown in a pan and the smell grossed me out so much that I pretty much swore off bologna from that day forward.  Until now.  I will only ever eat Au Cheval Bologna as long as I live.In short, I love this place. It's like a grown up diner with an edge and a whole lot of creativity.  Love it."
"This place has an amazing double cheeseburger.  I ordered it with the fried egg.  You have to have the fries, which are fried in pork fat--do I need to say more! This place is really great, amazing food and great cocktails."
"We went here on the recommendation of a friend.  He said it was some of the best drunk food he's ever had in his life.  Naturally, we went for dinner mildly buzzed, thanks to a few drinks from little goat and haymarket.The menu was pretty easy to navigate, but we put our trust in the waitress, since we figured she'd know best.  We started off with drinks and the chopped salad.  The bloody mary I got was fantastic.  It had the perfect amount of spice to it: enough to hit you but go away after a little while.  It was one of the best I've ever had.  The chopped salad came loaded with bacon as thick as me.  Bacon was great.  Salad was all right, although pretty dill'eyFrom then on it was just fantastic.  The foie gra and scrambled eggs and texas toast were fantastic.  I never would have ordered it without her advice.  We just dipped the toast into the mess of gooey awesomeness on the plate.  Definitely a get.The burger was really good.  We got it topped up with the bacon again, since I hadn't gotten my fix yet.  Definitely a solid burger.  Lastly, got the garlic mashed potatoes, which were also great.  On a side note, I really wanted to try the fried balogna sandwich since I heard it was awesome, but couldn't get the girlfriend on board.  Oh well.  For me, when I go to an expensive restaurant, it has to give me something I couldn't ever get similarly at a cheaper restaurant.  This place has a very unique take on diner food and was a different experience for me.  Also, I enjoyed the hell out of it, so it's absolutely worth 5 stars for me."
Just had an early dinner at Au Cheval last night with some friends and it was probably the best dining experience I've had in a long time.It took us about 30 minutes to get a table for four on a Saturday night around 5:30.  I think this is when the restaurant opens for dinner.  We enjoyed several of their specialty cocktails while we were waiting.  My favorite drink was the Strange Brew.  They have a fantastic selection of draft beers and a very reasonable House Shot (whiskey) for less than $4 and also a tall boy of your choice for under $4.We were seated around 6PM and greeted by a very friendly and not overbearing server.  She gave us a few recommendations since we were all new to Au Cheval and stopped by frequently to check on our waters and our drinks.  My wife and I ordered the single cheeseburger with a fried egg and thick cut bacon as well as one of their breakfast options.  As a table we shared the matzah ball soup and the marrow bones with toast and marmelade.  Everything was super delicious.  The single cheeseburger is actually a double patty and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had.  The bacon was the highlight of the night for me.  I've never had such good bacon before.  The marrow bones appetizer was also very very good but for the price there wasn't that much to share.I would definitely recommend Au Cheval to anyone dining in the West Loop.  It is a small restaurant in terms of space but it packs a big punch.
"Great experience, loved the atmosphereAtmosphere/ Decor 4/5Food/drinks 4/5Service 3.5/5Food was great, drinks were good, server was slightly distracted with what seemed to be her regulars but, did not affect the attention of our table too much, she was very polite, professional and very knowledgeable of the menu (helpful suggestions).We will definitely return for more good times Kacie even offered to take a group picture for us, which we were delighted to have the whole group in the picture instead of the usual , everyone minus one."
"great food and great atmosphere!I think to myself every time I go there, how was this a greasy gyro joint at one point in time??? The place is beautiful, even though it is small it does not feel cramped. Burgers are crazy good, the fries with the egg on top are crazy good and they have beers that are... crazy good. I went on a late sunday night and sat at the bar and I was watching the kitchen staff clean up. One of them were cleaning frying pans and she was even scraping out the crevices around the handle with a skewer. I was impressed that they were so meticulous even when they cleaned. Or were they really on their game because rick bayless was there having a late night snack? I think a bit of both ;)"
"A lot of my friends were raving about this place so I had unrealistically high expectations when a vendor asked a coworker and myself to a Friday lunch here. The wait was 45 minutes when we arrived at 11:45 (accurately estimated by the hostess). They don't take reservations because they don't need to in order to fill the tables. This meal can be divided into three elements: beer, sides, and burger. First, the beer. Their selection was incredible and they offered to let you taste a couple before making your decision. I chose the Root Root Beer which tasted exactly like Root Beer- except better because of the alcohol. Second, the sides. Normally an after thought, I believe these dishes could be a meal in themselves. We sampled the All Vegetable Salad, Hash Browns, and Fries. I would order each of these again. The fries were some of the best I've ever eaten in my life. Finally, the burger. Single with egg and bacon. Two patties, with a thick slab of bacon and fried egg. Nothing compares to this burger (Not even Kuma's). It was simple yet perfectly cooked and the flavors were perfectly balanced. Well worth the wait- looking forward to my next visit."
Honestly the best cheeseburger - ever prepared. No joke.  And I love cheeseburgers.  But compiled with the three hour wait for a table (on my third try to go) .. I have to limit it to 4 stars.  But in the end.   Worth the wait.  And I'm sure I'll go again.  Amazing work Au Chavel
I've heard amazing things about this place and decided to give it a try. The atmosphere and the music playing was an amazing start to this dining experience. I ordered the toasted open-faced ham & cheese fondue with a fried egg and fell in love. The fondue was super cheesy and delicious and was a great pairing with the toast. Next time I'll make sure to try there famous burgers!
"The food is stellar.  Great place to share a bunch of plates with friends, because you want to try everything on the menu and all the portions are huge.  Special standouts to me were that porterhouse *soooo delicious* and foie gras and scrambled eggs.  I love the casual ambiance of the place, and like that it's crowded, but it gets too crazy packed at peak and takes away from the enjoyment when you have to fight a gauntlet just to get out of your booth, never mind trying to get to the bathroom, LOL."
"I've been meaning to write a review for this place. Came here a few times and every time, I enjoy it. It's a place where you want to take your out of town friends to because you know they won't be disappointed. It's a simple menu and I like that. It's cuts down on the time it takes your gf to pick an item while your stomach is grumbling. Anyways, I've tried the omelet, foie gras w/ eggs, burger, and chillaquiles. They were all good. Eggs melt in your mouth, foie gras is so rich and buttery almost. burger is just a good ole burger with an egg on top. chillaquiles is more than just chips with sauce and cheese. Oh and they got some fancy drinks and regular beers too. Just go and enjoy this place!By the way, last time I came here, I took a cab and the Haitian cabbie told me Au Cheval means ""doggie style""? awesome"
"Solid work on the drinks, gorgeous atmosphere, delectable food. Try the double burger with an egg on top!"
"Get the following items:Foie gras + eggsBaconFries / Fries with eggsMixed drinksDon't get the following:Burger - not that great; thin patties and your ""diner"" style burger.  Meh.  I think you have to like foie gras and bacon to enjoy it here.  I've been here several times now over the last few weeks, and have tried most of the menu now.  Seriously, the foie gras and scrambled eggs is one of the best dishes I've had in Chicago.  GO NOW.  The bacon is also pretty spectacular, especially with the maple syrup.  SO GOOD.  Don't waste your appetite with the burger.  You can get better elsewhere."
"The cheeseburger,  The staff.  The environment.  ....awesome concept. Perfectly execuited."
"This place is so freaking good, I can't even deal with it. I didn't quite believe it when Bon Appetit named this place the #1 burger in the US, but after biting into that brioche bun with that quarter inch thick bacon and fried egg, it made absolute sense. And let's not just talk about this burger. Let's talk about the foie gras with scrambled eggs. This glorious dish with WARM foie gras, none of the overly processed, cold terrine business. The richness of the sauce, the fluffiness of the eggs, the warm toast. It was perfection. The same could be said of the bone marrow and crispy potato hash with heart duck gravy. Couple that with the dark room, heavy wood, and old school rap music - it is heaven in a little corner of Chicago."
"LOVE this place, but the wait on a weekend is always long.  If you can come earlier in the evening on a weeknight, it's usually pretty easy to get a table.  It's worth the wait though...promise!"
"I heart the food here!!!!! Sometimes you have to wait a really long time, but they will text you when your table is ready so I usually go over to Haymarket Pub for a drink while I wait.  The service was stellar and the food was amazing!  It's a tight fit in here, I wouldn't recommend going with a large group of people."
"THE BURGER. Just like all the rest of the reviews, this is my favorite burger is all of the US. I'm not really sure what the people who didn't like it were talking about. I'd suggest getting an egg on top, but maybe skipping the bacon - with the bacon on top as well it's pretty intense. The wait at Au Cheval, like most of the restaurants in the area is pretty long, but definitely worth it. I've been to Au Cheval 3-4 times now, always for the burger.  Service is hard to judge: One out of the 4 times our service was really bad, but maybe it was just an off night. Another time we sat at the bar and one of the cooks described to us everything he was making and was super friendly."
"Pure decadent, sinful diner bliss!  That is Au Cheval.  We had tried to go in before but there would be a very long wait (no reservations).  We decided to go for brunch and managed to get there early enough.  Au Cheval is more up scale diner with a twist.  The brunch menu has some more traditional fare mixed in with foie gras and scrambled eggs or potato hash with duck heart gravy.  I kept a watchful eye over other patron's food so my eyes could make the decision.  Aside from a neighboring patron's choice of a salad (really, a salad?), everything looked so good but I knew my eyes were bigger than my stomach.  The atmosphere was great. It was small, but I loved the open kitchen.  It was great to watch them work.  Service was excellent and our waitress knew the menu cold.We first got our brunch cocktails - bloody mary and a mimosa.  The pickles on the bloody mary were made in house and have a nice sweetness to them.  Both delicious.  We also had to get the fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli and a fried egg.  The fries came out first piping hot.  The mornay sauce was cheesy but not over powering.  The fries were seasoned perfectly, crispy on the outside and yet soft potato-y goodness on the inside.  I landed on the cheesburger a cheval - one of the staples our waitress told us - with the bacon and egg.  The burger is actually two  beef paties.  Having two smaller patties vs one big one gives it a little extra crunch.  There was a perfect sear on the patties which locked in all of the juices.  My first bite of this burger was just eye-popping heaven. You get a bit of the bread, very thin diced red onion, a mayonnaise/dijon sauce, cheddar cheese, and the juiciest burger ever. Oh but then there is that bite with the bacon. The thick peppered maple bacon was melt-in-your-mouth delicious ( we learned it is smoked in house).  And last but not least, you get that fried egg with a runny yolk that just brings it all together.  While it is certainly sinful, the onion (and pickle if you choose) helps to balance it and provide some freshness.  Best yet, that burger bun withstood the cheese, sauce and egg in stride without becoming soggy.   The portions are large.  The single burger is huge and we could have split it.  My husband and I looked at each other and each said it was the best burger we've EVER had. I now understand why Bon Appetit named it the best burger in the U.S. They have it figured out.  While my waistline can't afford a weekly visit, Au Cheval is that perfect guilty pleasure.  My mouth is already watering for the next burger visit."
"This folks may have been the best brunch experience OF. MY. LIIIIIIFE.Thanks Arlene for suggesting it and being such a great dining companion. She shares.I share. Everyone wins! We started with a blueberry muffin as an appetizer (don't judge) and I have to say it sort of knocked the socks off any morning pastry I've eaten. Tart blueberries and a touch of sweetness... yum! The real stars of the mid-morning though were the duck and sausage hash and the burger. Ooooooooh that burger. We ditched the cheese and had them add a fried egg and pork belly, because that was necessary. Holy cow. Perfectly cooked beef with a crisp outside, an ooey gooey fried egg that dripped over the beef, and tender pork belly... it was INSANE! The hash too. Rich duck with crispy hashbrowns I didn't want to end! It was packed when we arrived but they were able to seat us right away. Not really a large group spot, but perfect for two friends looking to catch up after months of being apart."
"So I heard all the hype about Au Cheval being the greatest burger place in Chicago and me being a burger connoisseur I had to try this place out. I have eaten at many places ( Nightwood , Blackbird, Kumas , Cortland's garage, Burger Bar , Bad Apple, Lockdown , and Rockit are just some). So many good places out there therefore I only right reviews if it is a huge disappointment. Where do I start with this place ,oh yeah the fact that four different people handled my food with there bare hands before it got to me. One guy literally has a stack of cheese in one hand and with the other hand is placing them on the burgers. Than you got the pickle guy placing the pickles on your burger , than another guy places an egg on my burger and than finally it goes on a plate where the server moved the burger with his hand to the center of the plate and placed a knife in it. And yes they cleaned there hands but with a wet towel that everyone carried on there side pocket and which I witnessed them using same towel to wipe the counter down. The burger itself was just a soggy mess between the half cooked patties and all the sauce. And I know this because I took one bite to please my date and left the rest on the plate. If you want to wait hours to get a table for a greasy mess and don't mind a bunch of strangers hands all over your food this is the place for you."
I've only had drinks and chicken livers here but it was great. The frites with aioli are also great.I need to go back to try the burger...
"Best burger in the city hands-down.  But first there was a 2.5 hour wait.  I guess that's the price you pay for heaven!!  The foie gras really is as good as people say too.  If the wait time was under an hour, I'd be there all the time"
Best burger that I have ever had!  Fries with the egg are amazing & the dipping sauces are so good!  Would go back in a heartbeat!
"Absolutely delicious! Went here late night for dinner on a Saturday night and everything was exceptional! We waited about 20 mins for a table, and the waiter was extremely nice and made some great recommendations.  We ordered the foie gras, bone marrow and beef cheek, and chicken wings. The bone marrow to my surprise was my absolute favorite!  The portions were pretty generous and it was a great dinner! I have heard their burgers are very highly rated, can't wait to go back and try them!"
Their burger is simply done how one should be. The fries are my favorite here. And the drinks are worth every penny. A definite new favorite.
"Burger, Beer, and Hip Hop in a French-y diner. It's beautiful. Go get a burger right now and get some fries while you're at it. I really wanna go back and try to General Jane's fried chicken, looks dope"
"To put this review in perspective: I love places that have buzz. Doesn't mean they're amazing, but the masses aren't usually wrong. I love places that are busy. I don't want my conversations to echo into the ether. I love simple menus. I would rather a masterful ten dishes than a mediocre thirty dishes. And finally, I don't love sharing. Chicago has far too many ""let's share everything"" style menus and I for one am over them. It's my meal. Let me order it and eat it. If you want to try, we will negotiate. Au Cheval. I am in love. It's more of a mistress love than a spousal love, but the heart wants what the heart wants. A little crowded at 6.30 waiting for a table. The place isn't huge by any stretch. If you enjoy a quality beer and cocktail selection, a menu that mixes French and American cuisine with simple aplomb, and a killer soundtrack of Indie hits you wish you owned, this is your joint. The service is what I needed. Water when I sat down. Prompt chilled hops-based beverage. Menu guidance. Friendly smile. Appropriate wait times for meal and clearance. No attitude (which is in unhealthy abundance in too many ChiTown eateries these days). My server Daniel was great - attentive, unobtrusive, knew his stuff - sit in his section if that's an option. Finally my food selection... The burger with bacon and egg. I couldn't adequately describe this on yelp. It's better than the best. Hash and duck gravy is a yummy side. Fries are ho-hum. All foie gras dishes get a tick from me. Simple and fancy, but mainly delicious. First date? Business meeting? Parents in town? Late night munchies? This place currently looks VERY cool on your Facebook check-in page. When you go home and roll into bed, you will have cheeseburger dreams."
"I will go back for another shot at this place.  I genuinely enjoyed their bone marrow, beer selection, and (greasy) burger (LOADED with thick cut backon and an egg)- these are the magnetic pull to the Au Cheval epicenter... however our server was slightly sub par in informing our table proper portions and on the beer list.  Though I thoroughly enjoy a culinary adventure, when my plates and beer come I would like to be somewhat informed as to what I am getting... nothing was bad and I will go back... no question there, I just need more info from the staff!Pretty good price for what you get and a GREAT atmosphere make me want to give a 4."
Salty. The drinks were good though.
"A good burger and a good beer are sometimes all you need.  And you can get both at Au Cheval, granted you can stand a bit of a wait.  We stopped in late on a Friday and debated whether or not to give it a shot where there was barely enough standing room only.  Just as we were about to order a drink from the bar, the hostess came over and seated us.  Apparently, we scored a corner table from some other couple who ended up leaving.  The burger is rated one of the best in the country, and it was pretty amazing, with it's juicy patties (you actually get two for the ""single"" and three for the ""double"").  Along with the gooey, melted cheese and a pickle, it's simplicity at it's best.  Plus, the knife sticking out of the top gave it bonus points for presentation.  Service was knowledgeable about the beer list and genuinely interested in our questions.  Her honesty and humor definitely put her on the top of service I've received."
***I'm writing this review from my Husbands point of view.  I do not eat meat so this restaurant was not a good fit for me.  Even the fries are cooked in duck fat so there were limited options for me but I won't judge that based on my eating habits. A single cheese burger contains 2 patties and is very hard to finish due to the size.  Not sure how anyone could finish the double! French fries tasted like duck fat goodness. Hasbrowns were fried to perfection. The beer list was extensive with great detail. He will definitely be back but just a warning that if you don't eat any meat this is not the spot for you....eat before but try a few drinks while you are there.
"We had no idea where we were wandering in Chicago so we just Yelped dinner nearby when we got hungry and found Au Cheval.  I hate to say the h-word but it was hipster central - the menu was a little too adventurous for my friend (bone marrow and lots of foie gras) but the burger was right up his alley.  I ADORED the mashed potatoes.  I could have eaten like 3 portions and called it a meal.  Nom.Service was good.  The hostess was super friendly, made sure we had a drink while we waited for a seat, and gave us her menu recommendations.  Wish I'd gotten her name to post here.I would return for sure."
"Cool atmosphere...Love trying places I haven't been, but I got sick from their burger."
"Delicious for lunch and dinner! Go for broke, burger with the egg and add the bacon, the fries are awesome."
"I'll start off saying the fries were real good and the burger was good. If you have 2 hours to burn to get a burger and fries then go for it. We waited approximately 30 minutes for a table which didn't bother me at all. The issue was it took 1.5 hrs to get in and out and we scarfed our food down because we were running late.  The kitchen really needs to get it together and become more efficient. The servers are friendly, but are just horrible.  I wish I read the reviews on the abnormally waits prior"
Who knew the French knew how to brunch! Loved every single dish we ordered from the brunch menu. Chilliquiles (don't judge!) is awesome and I don't know what they do to their eggs but its divine. The bloody mary was so so but the fries topped with eggs was scrumptious. A shout out to the warm n welcoming hostess. We went an hour after it opened so got seated within 20 mnts but it got crowded fairly quickly.
"Went here on a cold rainy night in April. I think it was a Tuesday or Wednesday, so the wait was nil. Sat at the bar, which has quickly become my favorite thing to do at restaurants. My GF and I both ordered the Cheeseburgers (the single one, which is huge) and they both were seriously amazing. I got egg and the seriously thick bacon on mine and she got hers pretty plain.Best burger in Chicago so far, AND reasonably priced. 1 order of fries is enough for 2.Au Cheval is 100% amazing."
"Food:I had the burger (with bacon on it) and split some fries with my friend. This burger is phenomenal. It is super basic (just cheese and bacon I think) but super super tasty and super super juicy. Definitely one of the best burgers I have ever had.Drinks:Excellent tap list of some stuff that is fairly rare. Also, tested out their bloody mary, also super tasty.Atmosphere:Like a upscale diner basically and they play their music off a reel-to-reel tape player which is pretty cool too. Staff is very nice. Went here around 6:30 on a weekday and getting a seat was not an issue. I will be back to try other items!"
Cool concept - nice space - poor layout (ie: the bar) and **very poor customer service**
"Let me just say that the first thing that you will notice is the Atmosphere... or maybe the smell of epic goodness!!! When you walk in, there is a diner-style grill with stools on your left, a usually straight forward no-nonsense hostess standing by a reel-to-reel machine. Not 100% sure if it is actually playing the great selection of tunes that are normally heard or not. So you sit at the grill, or in a booth or just at a table. Heaven awaits... First, the burgers... WOW. Delicious! Probably one of the best I have ever had. Totally different from the norm. If you sit at the grill, you can see the care taken and precision with everything that they create. You watch them throw down the meat, let me just mention that a single will probably be enough for 99.9% people that walk in. Because a single is actually a double, and a double is actually a triple! Back to the grill... So they cook to order, (go with medium rare of course) you can add bacon, (more like porkbelly, yes it's that thick) or a fried egg as well. You actually see them remove the burger from the grill and let the meat rest before they plate. That's a little trick that most places do not do, they'll slap it on a bun and a greasy mess is what you get. Resting the meat is very important because it allows the meat to cool ever so slightly while sucking back in all those tasty juices that give the meat the maximum flavor. When they finally do plate your burger, they add these marinated pickles and a tasty aioli sauce that adds to the sweet, salty, savory goodness. I would suggest to go for the fried egg on top and have the bacon on the side. Two large thick cut slices may be a tad over the top for my liking. Then, heaven is delivered. This thing is a monster, so you may want to use a knife! It's everything a burger should be, or shouldn't be. I think i went four times in a month after I popped the cherry here. Not really good for my cholesterol, but hey! It was worth it!Also, you may want to try the Duck heart gravy hash. Amazing as well. The honey chicken is about the best fried chicken I have had in long time as well! Even down to the perfectly square ice cubes in your iced tea, (or your whiskey) this place has got every detail covered for an amazing, unique dining experience. It's only a matter of time before this place has lines like Kumas. Enjoy!!!"
"1,000,000% worth the hype (and wait)!  Definitely the best burger I've ever had, it beats Paradise Pup (yes, I've had Kuma's and wasn't impressed).  We went around 1:30 on Saturday and waited about 20-30 minutes for a table for 4.  The hostess, Kyra (sp?) was friendly, funny, and genuinely wanted us to enjoy our visit.  Same with our server, Devon.  She gave us great food recommendations and we enjoyed everything we ordered - both food and drinks.We split 2 burgers (the singles = 2 beef patties), the side of fries with the egg and dipping sauces, as well as the hash browns with duck heart gravy.  More than enough food for the 4 of us.  I cannot wait to go back.  But with a party of 2-4.  There isn't a lot of seating if you have more than 4 people."
"Yum. So yum. Extra special yum. This place is really good.  The drinks are super awesome and STRONG.  Try the Old Fashioned.  Burger does NOT need ketchup, they should never bring ketchup to the table ever ever ever again!  Desserts are delish as well.  Really enjoyed myself.  Staff was very friendly."
"Au Cheviiiiiiiiiiiit!  This place is awesome!  Grabbed lunch at Au Cheval today and it was five stars all the way.  From the moment we walked in the door to the moment we walked out, it was top notch.  The hostess was delightful and our server was attentive and helpful.On to the food which was worth every single rich, tasty calorie! I went with a friend and we each had a burger and split the hash with duck heart gravy.  The burgers were perfect.  I balance of rich beef, melty cheese, salty pickles and a creamy sauce that brought it all together.  Asked for a side of the bread and butter pickles and they were good on the hash and the burgers, the sweet/salty and vinegary  pickle helped to cut through the richness of each dish and was a perfect compliment.The hash with duck heart gravy is one of the best things I have eaten....ever! The potatoes had an amazing crunch, the gravy had the perfect texture and the duck hearts melted in your mouth.  This is a dish your mind and your mouth wander back to and have to have again!Great beer selection, some great cocktails (although we did not try them the descriptions looked inventive) and just a super cool vibe.  I know that Au Cheval is getting a lot of buzz and it should...it does not disappoint."
"Had a good time here meeting a friend for dinner after work. I didn't realize how small this place really is. True to it's description, the place is set up like a diner, but the food is certainly a bit fancier.  We opted for a simple dinner; we got the fried bologna sandwich and cheese burger with fried egg to share, along with fries and a salad. The bologna was very salty, and I can't believe I'm saying this, but it was almost too salty. It's piled high and with generous amounts of cheese oozing all over. The cheeseburger was good and had so much flavor that it didn't ketchup, but I wouldn't say it's the best in the city.  We came right around 5:00, so we didn't experience the long wait times like most reviewers did. One annoyance was the price of their beers. While they do have a nice selection, even for that area it is a bit high. I also found paying $6 for some french fries was kinda crazy. I could see maybe if there was something done to them, but it's just a cup of seasoned fries. Maybe it's just me but a side of french fries shouldn't cost more than half the price of the burger.  At several other places, you get a better and bigger burger with fries for a cheaper overall cost. I would go back, but only during a week night right after work. The food didn't wow me enough to justify waiting more than 30-45min for a table."
"If the value of any restaurant is determined by if they're willing to bring you extra toast for your open faced ham and cheese fondue, then Au Cheval passes with flying colors.All kidding aside, the food was great and everyone enjoyed their beer selections. Our server Jennifer(?) was super helpful too. Not a huge spot for big parties, but more than accommodating for our group of 6. Also, get dessert. The millefeuille and root beer float: two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper*Also, the Hungry Hound Steve Dolinsky was eating/filming next to us which seemed enhance the experience for all of us. He is surprisingly svelte in person. Who knew!*Egregious Drake Reference"
"Okay food. Too heavy for my tastes. Came here for brunch with a friend for a catch-up.  After hearing amazing things, I was expecting more but maybe Au Cheval isn't quite my cup of tea. For starters, it was LOUD.  We were seated in a booth near the bar and that meant there were people drinking & waiting packed up next to our booth the whole time.  Felt like we were having a hangover brunch still in the bar from the night before!Next up - the food.  I had the duck heart gravy hash and my friend had the cheeseburger and split an order of fries. The food is flavorful but very heavy and salty. The duck heart hash is delicious for the first 3 bites... And then just gets to be too much. Would have been nice to be served with a light side (fruit?) to lighten things up. As a direct result of the heavy food, we both fell asleep for about half an hour!  Morale of the story?  Your mouth will be happy for the first few bites which makes it kind of worth it... But clear your schedule after to prepare for the food coma!  I went to a show after and my date had to keep pinching me cuz I fell asleep.  Will be back for dinner (since I plan to sleep after anyway)."
"Au Cheval's sign says diner and bar.  But don't let the bar sign lure you into to thinking you can get a drink without ordering some food.  Or that, like in a normal bar, you can sip a drink while you wait for your table.  For it is not to be.  Think Diner and you will be fine.I arrived on their 5th day of business after a LONG day and wanting to meet some friends.  The hostess took my name and phone number and told me there was a 20 minute wait.  No problem or so I thought.  For it was then it fell apart as I moved into the restaurant to grab a drink at the bar to wait for my table and my friends.""You can't just have a drink at the bar"", said the hostess.  ""And we have a no standing room policy.  You'll have to wait outside for your table, or there are other bars around"", said she rattling off several in the area.  ""We're not a bar"", she finished with.  Funny, your sign says you are.Wait outside?  It was raining and the wind was blowing like crazy.  I think not.  So I wandered over to Holiday Bar and Grill where a very affable bartender shared with me other stories of those that had gone before me to Au Cheval only to find a litany of rules.And of course- 6 minutes later, my phone rings and tells me my table is ready- about the same time my beer had arrived.  So I finished my beer and went back across the street. Good thing my friends arrived at the same moment for another rule is that they don't sit partial parties which at least is a rule I can understand.  Also- don't bring a large party as they also won't move tables to accomodate groups larger than 4.  We watched a group sit next to each other but not together but I suspect that is due to the intimacy of the place.  Keeping up with all of these rules?We were seated at a table in the back.  The decor is cool and the music is great.  It was so dark, though, at our table that the menu was hard to read but we managed through it with some help from our server.I will tell you the specialty drinks were great!  The Hemingway daiquiri and my rye drink were delicious, and the long beer list will have any hops loving fan in heaven.But the food, for us- didn't get the same high marks.  We ordered three dishes that the server recommended, the bratwurst and mashed potatoes, the beef stew and bone marrow and the ""fried chicken"".  For sides- we went with french fries with aioli sauce (good) and the bread and butter pickles (eh)The entrees were just okay.  The winner of the group had to be the beef stew but not by much.  Know that the fried chicken is chicken thighs and not like any fried chicken we had had- although the sticky coating was pretty tasty.  And that bratwurst could have used a little more seasoning (or at least a bun and some mustard and onions ) to give it any flavor at all.But the big winner here was dessert.  If you go for any reason- get the root beer float.  Worth every darn calorie and that root beer is delicious!  And I loved that they gave you a little extra root beer to pour over the top.  The other dessert which was some kind of pastry with cream between the layers looked better than it tasted.Think diner- but don't think diner prices.  The average tab per person was about $40 (with drinks and dessert)  And if you drive- there is no valet but there is plenty of parking along Randolph or Halsted.I'm going to give them some time to work out the kinks and then try it again.  But for now- my memory of this place was not of great food or service (which I usually have at other Sodikoff restaurants) but of a litany of rules and the need to run around on a rainy night."
"Walked in to Au Cheval to hear Beastie Boys' ""Eggman"" playing.  I can't remember the last time I so enjoyed entering a restaurant.  All of the music was great -- would love to get my hands on their mix.    Even better than the music is the food.  A friend and I shared the following dishes:-Homemade Bread and Butter Pickles (see photo)-Crispy Fries with Mornay Sauce, Garlic Aioli, and Fried Egg-Beef Stew with Marrow Bone and Bread-General Jane's Fried Chicken with Sesame Seeds, Chili, and Cilantro (see photo)They should seriously consider canning and selling their homemade pickles.  I'd buy.  The crispy fries make a great appetizer or side dish to share as it's quite a big portion -- the fries are perfect when combined with garlic, cheese, and runny yolk.  I understand completely why Yelpers have been raving about the Beef Stew.  Melt in your mouth.  Really delicious.  And, the bone marrow was the biggest I've ever seen (and I've seen some bone marrow in my time!)  It was HUGE.  The Fried Chicken was spicy and sweet -- their take on General Tsao's chicken. They use a whole chicken, so expect leftovers.  Overall, a great spot.  Hard to believe that a Greek fast food place used to be in this same location.  The atmosphere is great - dark, romantic, cozy.  A little on the loud side for dinner at 6pm, but again, great music!  Oh, and they have Berghoff root beer on tap.  Yum!"
This review is based solely on what I ate: burger and truffle fries. It was heaven dancing on my palette. Soooo darn good!
"That burger!Although I love a good  burger, this past year I have been rather choosy in when and where to indulge in an effort to shed a few points of my bloated cholesterol (though in fairness it is a few points below the national debt). It had been a few months since my last burger and I had heard so much praise about Au Cheval's rendition. The West Loop is comfortably situated half way between work and home, so when a snowstorm leads to cars moving slower than a clogged artery I often take a pit stop in the West Loop to wait out rush hour. That's right, I am blaming the Chicago winter on my decision tonight to partake in a bacon cheeseburger - at least I had the willpower to nix the fried egg addition.Au Cheval is partly a hip, upscale diner and partly a craft beer pub; the menu is definitely best described as sinful. The single cheeseburger is two patties and the double cheeseburger is three patties. Not sure what they would call it in France. The menu also features comfort food such as fried bologna, roasted bone marrow with beef cheeks, fries with mornay sauce and a fried egg, bacon with fried chicken and six cheeses rolled in duck fat topped with three different kinds of eggs sandwiched between a doughnut and a a slice of foie gras infused apple pie (OK, I made the last one up, but it would blend right in with the rest of the menu). Definitely not the place if you are seeking to lose some weight or eat healthy - but alas, I gave up health food for lent. Heart attack snow meet heart attack food. While the vibe at Au Cheval is not really my style (a bit too hipster, loud, crowded, no reservations and dark - I really had to squint my middle aged eyes to be able to discern the menu) I do have to say that my burger tasted so incredible that I did not even feel guilty. That is some serious high quality beef cooked to perfection; I strongly recommend opting for the bacon addition; an extremely thick cut (as thick as the beef patties) that adds a nice sweet and smoky contrast to the beef. The housemade bread is heavenly and the cheese was outstanding too. Definitely one of the best burgers I have enjoyed... if not the best, better than sex (well, at least sex with me). One of the pricier burgers too (I believe it was $13.50 with the bacon addition), but well worth the upcharge. Do not ask for condiments; adding anything to the Au Cheval burger would be akin to slathering a prime steak (or an A5 cut of Wagyu) with A1 sauce; totally sacrilegious... and definitely not hip. Au Cheval also features a vast selection of craft beers; there are about two dozen on tap and the menu has a nice description of the flavor profiles. I had the Mikkeller It's Alive with my burger. There is just over a half dozen cocktails (I had the Dark Horse: Old Overholt Rye with with lemon, ginger beer and Angostura bitters to kick off the evening) and a small wine selection. Very reasonable prices on the beverages ($10 to $12 for most wines and cocktails, $6 to $9 for most beers). Our server was really friendly, but was spread a bit thin so it did take quite a while to receive our first round of drinks; not sure if they were short staffed due to the snow or if this is the norm. As I generally try to eat at least moderately healthy and am a bit too dorky for the hip vibe at Au Cheval I do not see myself becoming a regular here, but I definitely see the appeal and understand why they are such a hot venue. Next time I find myself craving a burger there is a pretty good chance I will end up here. Now that spring is fast approaching I will have to come up with a new excuse to drown out the little voice inside my head rehashing my doctor's warning to eat healthy (as the chances of another snowstorm are slim)... didn't Tom Skilling predict an above average chance for thunderstorms for April?"
"SUCH a great experience! My first of Brendan Sodikoff's expanding fine-dining empire, and it really deserves the full five stars. Service was friendly and dialed-in, beer list was extensive, and the ambience is very unique and enjoyable. The food and cocktails, even at a slightly higher price point, are totally worth it. Much of the menu won't be found anywhere else and Chicago, and they don't charge you an arm and a leg.Only things that I had to adjust to were the volume of the music, and the dim lighting. Neither of which would prevent me from coming back again (and again)."
The hype is real - best burger in the city.
I need more stars. Best burger of all time. I waited an hour for a table. I'd gladly do it again.
"I've been back to Au Cheval a few times since my initial review. I think I've since nailed down the best order for me: a single cheeseburger with no egg or bacon, a side of fries (not the ones with the egg on top), and a root beer.This place is deliciously sinful. It'll send your daily calorie intake through the roof. (Assuming, of course, you don't just get a salad.) But it's worth so it! Even when I'm full, I just can't stop eating. Best root beer I've ever had. I'm salivating right now just thinking about it. Even if you're a beer drinker, you owe it to yourself to try the root beer. Next time, I'm really going to get that root beer float... I already know it's going to be amazing!"
"The atmosphere of this place is great. Very comfortable with a trendy crowd. Initially I was put off by the abrupt front of house staff, but our personable and knowledgeable server made up for it by going above and beyond. They have a great beer selection, but the burgers were just ok, certainly not worth the wait or the hype. They were not bad, but they lacked deep flavor and were over cooked and overly greasy (not to be confused with juicy). The fries and the dessert were good. Overall... meh"
"By far the BEST BURGER in town!!  As well, other delicious items: the duck hash browns,  the mashed potatoes with garlic gravy and if you like foie gras.  This place is delicious but the wait time isn't so great."
"Having eaten at Maude's, Bavette's, Gilt Bar, and Au Cheval, its clear that Brendan Sodikoff has cornered the market on dead sexy dining.  Prior to eating here a mention of short order burgers would not evoke sultry thoughts, but I have passed the Rubicon, my noble bourbon boozers.The burgers here are simple and deliciously tasty; two thin patties, cheddar cheese, aioli and onions.  Simple perfection, and possibly the best burgers in the city of Chicago.  I strongly urge you not to gild the lily by adding bacon or cheese; the bacon is a thick, overly fatty cut that dulls the sharp edges of the burger; a crisper cut of bacon would be preferable, but as that is not an option have your burger classically styled and you will be the better for it.  The french fries are classically crisp on the outside, flaky/chewy on the inside.  They are served with aioli but I endured the scowl of the serving staff and asked for ketchup - you should similarly feel no shame.So, yes, the burgers are great and that's why you came here, but it is all the extras which make you linger.  Delicious cocktails, a sick music selection, and a delicious dessert keep you in your luscious, leather upholstered booth.  My fellow noble bourbon boozers will love the earthy cognac stylings of the Vieux Bonal, which can be followed by the powerful old school kick of the Old Fashioned.  For dessert, you'll want to sample the Neapolitan rainbow of Black Dog gelato, which is sublime and even better than the mint chip laden variety your parents bought you as a child of the Seventies.  But tonight, you'll remember you're childhood fondly through a beef and booze laden haze of pleasure.The only question for you now, is, why would you want to leave?  The leather booths are made for evening length sit ins.  As long as your liver keeps up, the sexy music will make you glad you stayed for a round or five after dinner."
"The wait for this small, darkly lit diner with vintage fixtures owned by the same guy behind Maude's and Gilt Bar is usually absurd: an hour to 2 hours even on weekdays. But that's because the artery clogging food and the craft cocktails are amazing.My recommended strategy would be to drop by, put in your name (no phone reservations are accepted), and then grab a drink at Maude's, Girl & the Goat, or another Randolph street bar until your name is up. There are lots of tasty foods on the menu, but get the burger: everyone I take here consistently agrees that it's the best burger they've ever tasted. A single is actually a double cheeseburger, and a double is a triple. No idea why. It's good as-is, but the extra few bucks for the egg is worth it. If you want to go all out, add the bacon too, but be warned that the resulting cheese, egg, meat combo may send you into cardiac arrest right there on the spot. I generally skip the bacon because I find the cheese + egg to be salty enough. In the winter, try the avoid the table in the far back right corner, it's drafty and you will be cold without a jacket."
"Went to Au Cheval for brunch the other day - and enjoyed it quite a bit!  My party arrived a bit late, however the hostess & waitresses kept me company and I enjoyed bantering with them while I waited for my group.My compadres and I ordered the bologna sandwich, the burger, the omelette, and a side of fries.All were delicious.  The bologna was fantastic - particularly the mayonnaise/dijon mustard sauce that it was smothered with.  It had a nice sweet / bitterness that complimented the house-made bologna quite well.I also sampled the burger, w/ bacon & egg - was delicious as well.  I can't necessarily say it was the ""best burger ever,"" but it was quite good, and I would definitely recommend it if you like burgers.I didn't taste the omelette, but my friend who ordered said it was amazing, and she couldn't get over the consistency of the eggs - ""velvety, silky, etc.""  I'm assuming she must eat a lot of fabric to be able to apply those adjectives to her food.Beer selection is also top notch - except for ONE THING.  They use 14-oz ""pint"" glasses - a sham which has become the norm, particularly at newer establishments.  Take a look at the bottom of your ""pint"" glass here - it is about twice as thick as a real pint glass.  Was disappointed to see this, particularly when the beer prices are the same or more than other places where you get a real pint.  More details if you're curious:The Wall Street Journal - ""A Pint-Size ProblemBeer lovers nurse a grudge as some bars switch to smaller glasses"" online.wsj.com/article/S…Anyway, regardless of the beer glass size, I highly recommend Au Cheval - food, atmosphere, and service were all top notch."
"Excellent! I had to stop after the first scrumpscious bite, put my burger down & write a review about just how delicious this is! A bit of a wait, but very fast service once you're at your table. Excellent choices of beers to accompany your meal, too! Highly recommend!!"
"No lie, the best burger I have ever had.  Worth the two and half hour wait on a Saturday night, we just went over to Lone Wolf for a few cocktails beforehand.  The fries were perfect also, served with an aioli for dipping.  If you are craving a burger, this is the only place.  I don't think I could eat a burger anywhere else after this.  Our server was great also, very friendly and gracious."
"Au Cheval gets five stars for the burger alone.  It's that good.  Good enough to overcome the inconsistent service.The place is small and loud, but not necessarily in a bad way and their music is always on point.  As others have mentioned, there is invariably a wait so be prepared for that.  I'm perplexed at why some reviewers take offense to this, as if the long wait is an act of poor service."
"Let me preface what I am about to say with the following:Au Cheval is bomb.   Like, super bomb.  Great concept, great execution, and most importantly, great food and drinks. I plan on going back to try some more of their food.However,I do not believe this is the best burger in the city./awkward silence/ waiting for someone to throw something at me.An awesome burger yes, especially when you go for the double patty, and add a fried egg.  Super rich, cooked perfectly in all its gluttonous glory.  That being said, the pickles weren't enough to cut through all of it, and by the end you end up feeling how I imagine Kobayashi feels after a competition- overstuffed, sweaty, and kinda... gross.  One could argue that this was my own fault for ordering the double w/ an egg.  To that I say, pish posh.  This is the way all burgers were meant to be eaten.  I would just take another burger over said burger at Au Cheval.  4/5 stars overall"
"Where do I begin and what do I say that hasn't already been said? The hour wait on a Tuesday evening was well worth it.  Sat at the counter which I must say added to the experience.  Seeing the creations prepared only made it harder to choose a dish. (Poor me) The service was great.  Not only was our waitress awesome but other waiters running food chimed in when overhearing my dinner companion and I discuss what to get. I was in a salmon kinda mood and it did not disappoint. Grilled to perfection and I paired it with the mash potatoes-  all the goodness in my mouth combined. Tried my friend's burger, and wow! Going back soon to have one of my own."
"This was our last meal in Chicago. I haven't eaten so well in a 7-day stretch ever. And the cherry on top, or the turd on top is Au Cheval. So it was Au Cheval or the Publican. My buddy says ""foie gras"" and I say Au Cheval, f'sho. So what the hell happened? Let's share the blame. Our fault: we ordered too much goddamn food. I wonder if my ""friend"" was counting on having left overs while we split the bill. So we get...foie gras with eggs, fries with eggs, some absurdly terrible and large bone marrow dish, an order of bacon, fried chicken, and hashbrowns. For four people. Okay, maybe I'll take a bit more blame and put this up to two stars. But I can honestly say the only good thing out of that ridonk spread were the french fries. To be honest, those fries were amazing. Now I'm not going to review every single darn course. Just the foie gras w/ eggs tasted like some slippery mushy guts with slippery mushy yellow guts. I love foie gras...when it's seared...or when it's awesome...not when it's festering in a pool of god-knows-what. Alright I'm going to hit up the bone marrow too: WTF was this?! seriously, this wasn't bone marrow. There was bone marrow but there was also some super salty, super nasty meat thing all in the bone. If you want to do some heavy heavy eating, come here and please take my advice and order moderately. Do not quadruple down on the starches. If you want to have a terrible meal, order 1.5 courses / extra side per person and have a ball."
"I didn't know this place was known as the ""best burger in Chicago"" until after I ate here so I'm glad I happened to order the burger while there!  Although the burger was absolutely delicious - I'm not quite sure I'd give it the elusive ""best burger in Chicago"" title.  I will say it was cooked perfectly for medium-rare but it was a touch too greasy (and thus extremely messy to eat) for my taste.The restaurant itself had a cool vibe - I would describe it as a modern industrial look.  They also have a small exhibition style kitchen so people sitting at the bar/counter can watch the cooks.  The ladies bathroom is clean and modern and they provide hand lotion which is always a plus!The worst part about my experience here was waiting to be seated because the waiting area is SO small.  I wouldn't even consider it a waiting area - it's more like an extremely tight space between people sitting at the bar and people sitting in booths.The major redeeming factor during our wait was that they had Three Floyds Zombie Dust on tap.  Considering it's ranking on Beer Advocate's Top 250 beers, it was a great find!Tip:  They have free coat/bag check!"
"Apologies to the chef for not tasting your food before reviewing, but your hostess/waitress was so rude, we turned around and left before even sitting for 1 min. Her attitude of us doing her a favor by being there left a bad taste in my mouth, leaving the chance to enjoy food minimal."
"Don't let the wait time deter you, Au Cheval is a one of a kind diner in Chicago. We went on a Friday night and were told it would be about a 1.5 hr wait, which we were anticipating. However, after going to another nearby establishment on Randolph St. only 20 minutes later we were called. We hustled back and were seated immediately. Since we were with a large group we tried ALOT:-Bratwurst: Delicious, huge w/ fabulous garlic mash-Double burger w/ bacon & fried egg: Phenomenal. I know why everyone calls it the best burger in the city.-Bologna Sandwich: Yummy, but maybe a little too over the top fatty for me.-Fried Chicken: Spicy and perfect. Probably my favorite thing that we ate.-French fries w/ fried egg: A little much for me, since we ate them near the end of the meal, but they were salty, delicious and  decadent.-Root Beer Float: Made with the best rootbeer ever and Black Dog Gelato, this was the perfect ending to our meal.So despite the fact that I felt like a complete fatty by the end of the meal, I did enjoy my meal at Au Cheval. Definitely not someplace I could eat at every day, but would be great every once and a while."
"This was our second time there and it was much better. I had the foie and eggs and she had the hamburger. Very good hamburger, fabulous foie and eggs. I recommend both highly. Of special note:We sat at the end of the bar and could watch the chefs as they worked.  The chefs even found a minute to speak. All the staff we talked to was genuinely nice and pleasant and I will go again just for that reason. Good food, good beer, and a staff that seems glad you are there. What else could you want!"
"Excellent food. I was not disappointed by anything we ate or drank. The bologna  sandwich was amazing. The wait can be excessive on the weekend, but if you show up 10 minutes before they open, you'll probably have no issue getting a table. If not, it's worth the wait!"
"Seriously, divine. My boyfriend and I go often for brunch since he lives across the street. The wait for a table is usually long, but we've never had trouble getting bar seats immediately. I actually prefer the bar which is actually the ""kitchen""--it's fun to see everything being made!The menu is small because everything is executed to perfection. I've had every item on their brunch menu at this point and it's all incredible. It's not just eggs, toast, bacon, a tomato, and beans...it's the best of those items you've ever tried. Who knew that such simple ingredients could taste so heavenly? The portions are hearty. So, like that time we thought we could each get a full brunch dish and still share the fried egg fries? Wasn't hungry until the next day. But it was so worth it."
"LOVED this place!!  What really stood out to me was the service!  Everyone was so sweet and they really took care of you!  The ambiance was also great!  Get the CHEESEBURGER with egg!!  So simple, but so good!  The best burger I've EVER had!!  The patty was cooked and seasoned perfectly- lots of pepper and small pieces of red onion.  The sauce was great and the cucumber slices and egg were a nice touch.  A great experience overall :)"
"Rockstar service. If I could give them 10 stars for service, I would. Usually with different waitstaff checking in on you every now and then there's a large gap in quality. Or there are over-waiters who bug the hell out of you and don't know how to upsell for shit. Each suggestion was relevant to what we were looking for and we weren't annoyed by conversation.Had we more room in our tummies we would have tried everything. Our fault for ordering all starches. Pro tip: grub on the burger, the fried chicken, and lots of smashed potatoes.Be prepared to sit at the bar or wait for a seat though! They're busy busy busy. We came in on a Thursday evening and there was still a line."
"Google Translate tells us that Au Cheval is French for ""The Horse"", but wild horses couldn't keep me away from coming back to this spot again and again!But first, a quick history lesson. Previously in this location, there was a small late night grill. In the mood for a quick gyro sandwich at an affordable price? No problem, it was an acceptable convenient solution the times I would walk past them on the way home. One day,  their doors would shutter, never to open again. Gradually, the remnants of its former identity were stripped away eventually revealing what was to come. The words ""bar"" and ""diner"" typically don't appear together. What were we in store for?Tonight, I found the answer on the way home. Serendipity smiled upon me as some people left, right as I was approaching. My Yelper instincts activated! Wait, is this a soft open, or are they really open. I couldn't pass up the chance, and I walked in on this their second night of operation.Some nights much like you had done in your younger years, you might want simpler surroundings, simpler drinks in ample quantities and simpler food eaten in large volumes while listening to music that forces you to shout at your companions. However, some nights you want to feel like an adult, surrounded by luxurious fixtures, having access to food and drink that doesn't require mere quantity to satisfy you, because it can do it by taste alone. Au Cheval, is such a place for these sensibilities.The beer list? A very healthy list, organized by Light, Full, Specialty and Rich. This includes a number of local/regional brewers such as Half Acre, Three Floyds and Local Option. I tried the Local Option Morning Wood, a fantastic amber-ale with a tinge of coffee with a lot of flavor. There's also cocktails, wines and whiskey for those that aren't as fond of beer.The food is diner-inspired, but executed well past their diner foundations.  I went with the omelette du jour (spinach, caramelized onions and blu cheese made with eggs infused with a healthy amount of rich butter) and hash browns (separated into smaller patty sized portions, with the outer portions fried quickly to a crisp, leaving the core as a nice soft contrast to its exterior). The sides are definitely in a sharing portion side, good for 2-3 people.For dessert, there were a number of options including a root beer float, but once I heard the words ""Black Dog Gelato"", my desert fate was sealed. I chose Malted Vanilla (over Peppermint and Milk Chocolate.)There is a good amount of seating, alternating from the bar stools around the stainless steel bar, to some booths, and some tables toward the back. There is background music played at a level that keeps the vibe going, without forcing anyone to shout. All of the staff were friendly and helpful, especially Jenn who helped navigate my way through their drink and food selections.Though a part of me would like to keep this secret a little bit longer, the rest of me can't wait to have all of you try it and let me know what you think."
"Went to Au Cheval on Tuesday night-I'm giving the place 2 stars because the décor is beautiful and the hostesses were very nice.  However, the rest of the experience was either mediocre or terrible.  Our waiter (I can't remember his name but it started with a K...Kacey?  I dunno. ) was pretty bad...which took away from our table's enjoyment of the food entirely.   He didn't ask how our food was, forgot part of our order and didn't apologize, and then when I told him that $12 for a dark n stormy that was literally 90% ice was a bit rich, he had a little man tantrum and snapped ""we make all the drinks the same at the bar, sorry"" and ran away.  Even an idiot knows that you're supposed to be nice when you pretend that your hands are tied.......I hope this is an isolated experience but for the prices and the service, it seems like Au Cheval is taking advantage of the fact that it is a hot restaurant right now.  Based on my experiences there, I will not be back or recommend it to anyone.  There are way too many other hot restaurants in the West Loop that have both good food and good service."
"""What I like about this place is the fact that people that know about it know about it. And the people that don't know about it don't.""This is damn good food that manages to fly under the radar. Translation: Damn good food minus annoying foodie hipsters. Don't get me wrong. You'll find a cute twenty something Belle sucking Marrow from the Bone like it's got the antidote (a la Chris Rock). For the most part, Au Cheval is all about the food. Ironically, Au Cheval is located right across one of Chicago's most eponymous restaurants The Girl & The Goat. The vibe is a cross between an underground speak-easy/dive bar and cheap coffee shop/diner. At The Girl & The Goat, guests are there to be seen and to see just as much they are there to chow down. At Au Cheval, guests are there to eat, period.House-made Bologna Sandwich is probably the inspired force-meat Oscar Mayer's Mom used to make back in the day from scratch. It is excellent. Foie Gras with Brioche comes with preserved jam. It's the 1 am Breakfast of Champions.Fried Chicken is another slam dunk.The menu is peppered with dishes that represent elevated comfort food designed to satisfy the strongest of cravings for high calorie indulgences or late night after-bar munchies.Now I know about Au Cheval....the World is a better place."
"Came here after Goose Island's 25th Anniversary Block Party. Needless to say we were feelin' good and in need for some goooood food. Here's the low-down on our experience.General Jane's Fried Chicken was really good, kinda reminds of me Seoul Sassy Chicken (if you know yo Korean Fried Chicken). Roasted Bone Marrow was good as usual, but the beef cheek marmalade...whoah man...whoah....Double cheeseburger, I see how they got such a solid reputation on this one. Freakin' fantastic!Fried House-made Bologna sandwich. Glad we split it 4 ways. Crazy salty. However one should know this when ordering a fried bologna sandwich. It was a sodium overload that I don't think I could handle again. Plus I was pretty wrecked, but no competition for that burger (imo). They've got picklebacks, slap me silly. Hell yeah!Cool place. Had a lot of fun. Great food, great drinks, classy interior, good service, and just a fun place to be. Will definitely come back for brunch some time."
"This place is useful, funny, and cool. Kind of like this review. Just kidding. This review sucks. But Au Cheval is awesome."
"Let's get one thing clear: There are a LOT of ways to do a good burger. I personally am a fan of the char-burger. They tend to be a bit bigger/meatier and of course, the fire adds a level of flavor that isn't there with griddled burgers.That said; Au Cheval easily presents the best grilled burger in the city. That place you're thinking of? It's better than that. Yep. That one too. I'm not a huge foie gras-on-toast kinda guy...I'm more braunschweiger on a ritz...but that has changed with my introduction to the foie gras terrine with strawberry jam.Close your eyes when you eat it, and you will be in a little cafe in Paris. It is buttery, smooth, salty and just plain delicious...add the fresh jam, and the experience (even though it doesn't seem possible) changes for the better.Also at the table was my ""double"" cheeseburger done in the ""Au Cheval"" style with everything plus a fresh egg. This burger is fresh, done properly, has almost precise carmelization on every horizontal surface and is piled high with two more patties, perfectly melted cheese, a lighter brioche bun and tasty pickles. It is, in point of fact, the best burger I've eaten that hasn't been cooked by direct flame contact. The beer selection is not to be trifled with either. I had a Sunner Keller wheat that paired perfectly with everything that was at the table, but no matter the beer taste, you'll find one to suit you.Also at the table was the General Jane's fried Chicken. The flavor was incredible, the chicken was done to a 't'. The trouble I had was this: It's $20 for wings and drumsticks that were, at one point, frozen. I love this place, but I don't love the fact they're phoning in the fried chicken. Seriously kids, use fresh chicken and add in some white meat, or reduce the price a tick. Otherwise you're just Buffalo Wild Wings with some cilantro.The atmosphere is beautiful though, it's basic but elegant. The music is suited to the ambiance and although it's just there for show, the reel-to-reel player running behind the hostess station is a touch that sets them apart.It IS a scenester/hipster crowd, so be prepared for that, but if you're in that area already, you know the crowd. All told, this is a must. Get here, eat the burgers, drink the beer and try something new. You won't regret it."
"I had a countdown set on my Sprint Katana that I could stare at every day until me and my two-spirit, genderless Life Co-Companion, Chleometra, were planning on going to Cheval together.  When we finally arrived I found the venue was incredibly small and intimate, and featured a busy bar with bologna and bones being served to tables of laughing beautiful people, surely over the success of their latest high-speed, frictionless, groundbreaking polymer-free dildo design or whatever it is people do to make money (I wouldn't know, I get paid by the government to test hypno-terrorgas on my impressively stoic and unwarpable mind).  This was the first thing that struck me as odd since I'm used to fans typically being dressed in JNCO jeans and No Fear shirts, but I've never been to Cheval in Chicago before so I thought perhaps their following was different here.Cloemetra and I thought we grab some food from concessions in the meantime, I chose the Bone Marrow with Beef Cheek Tart even though I chew on my cheek all day which has become quite infected this sounded good and I also felt eating bones would help restore all the masculinity I've lost over the years from Yelping, protesting wall street, and wearing unisex clothing.  The boner marrow was delicious but I could get good boner marrow a few miles north in boy's town for half the price If I really needed to.  I still wasn't feeling quite amped enough for Cheval and was growing even more suspicious no announcements about the set had been made I decided to get a heaping order of sausage that I swallowed effortlessly with thick cut bacon so decadent it made Chloemetra blush to her aesthetic surgically implanted gills.We decided to depart after this as it had been an hour since the show was set to play and the concessions were fantastic, however, I never got to hear ""Send The Pain Below"", ""The Red"", or any other of Cheval's classic hits.  You would think a band would play their music instead of serving decadent meats but I guess this is truly a new era in music."
"I went here with a group of friends on St. Patrick's Day weekend. We knew there would be a wait and checked in, put our name in and proceeded to walk around the neighborhood a bit. After telling us the wait was 30 min, we received a text in 10 saying our table was ready. We ordered drinks and food not long after sitting down, delicious bloody mary's - and the food was amazing. I mean how can you go wrong with fried bologna! I will definitely be back!"
"Had dinner here the other night, thirty minute wait at 6:30PM on a Monday night. It was handled smoothly by the hipster chick standing in front of the reel-to-reel tape machine and about 15 minutes later I got a text message saying that I could come back (we wandered over to Haymarket)The menu is a bit, um, strange. Hard to determine whats a plat principal vs a entree, etc.The food is interesting. Well crafted and yummy. The prices are reasonable. I think the most expensive bottle of wine was $50~ish. Whiskey shot with pickle juice, anyone?Two thumbs up."
"This was on my list of places to try and after way too long I finally crossed it off - hooray!Went here on a date and overall I was happy with the evening, although compared to him I looked like a pig. He orders the salmon. I order the single cheeseburger with egg on it (of course) and a side of fries. He ordered a hard cider. I ordered an amazing beer, of which I've forgotten. Mmmm, carbs. He said his salmon was good, and my burger and fries were daaaaaamn good. I did have to cave and eat most of the burger with a knife and fork, because the juiciness of the burger, coupled with the yolk of the egg made for quick an amazingly delicious mess.We split a root beer float just like they do in the old time movies (two straws, one glass) and it ended lovely.While I have a slew of other places on my list I wouldn't mind coming back here."
"Came here right before closing on a Monday night so no wait! I'm on a quest for the best burger and I have to say that this might be the one. Washed that baby down with a few picklebacks and I was on my merry way home. Can't wait to see you again, Au Cheval. xoxoxx"
"Best burger I have had in a while. If you are a big bacon friend, I suggest adding bacon to your burgers. The bacon was an inch thick and tasted more like pork belly. It totally made my burger.  Foie gras and egg came with toasts was delicious but very heavy. I suggest getting that to share. The bone marrow was not bad but not that special. The reason I docked one start is because I feel the space can be quite cramped. My friends and I sat at the booth against the wall. There were constantly patrons standing in very proximity to our tables to get drinks/ hang out/ wait to get seated. Also, the restaurant is quite small and gets really busy at dinner. Plan accordingly and go early or expect to wait for an hour+."
Been here a bunch.  Crush buger and pickle backs until I can't stand anymore.  Not in a bacon mood today.  Sorry bacon.
Good service and great food! Burgers are the BEST!
"I have been here twice now, and was equally impressed both times.  I tried the cheeseburger, delicious but was not blown out of the water like I was when I returned the second time and had the fried bologna sandwich....DO IT....I insist.  It will blow your mind.  Both times I had to get the fries with the fried egg and garlic aioli and let me tell you, not a fry was left on the plate, so good.  I also had amazing service on both of my visits, really friendly and fun servers, this is not some snooty trendy place despite it's popularity.  Side note: you must go to the bathroom, even if you don't have to go and just wash your hands, their soap and lotion is to die for...I kept smelling my hands for the rest of the night like some creep."
Best Bloody Mary that I've had in Chicago! The bad part about this place though is that there usually is a wait and it's always crowded! Once you get in...order a bloody ASAP!
"Wow, no wonder people talk about the burgers here.  Double patties, melty cheese, fried egg, bacon, and some delicious sauce...it makes a perfect burger.  So perfect that even though your stomach is already full, you still want to keep eating.It's rich, there is no doubt about that, but if you want to spoil yourself, come here for the burger.  I don't like bacon, but I love what Au Cheval considers bacon.   I was going to nix the bacon since I am not a bacon fan but my fiance is so I was just going to give him the bacon, but when the burger came out, I realized that the so called bacon was really two tender, maple syrup glazed pork belly.  YUM.My fiance ordered the fried bologna sandwich which was definitely not your old school typical bologna sandwich.  The bologna is sliced super thin and piled high on a bun, so high they have to stick a knife in it to keep the meat piled on.  My friend ordered the foie gras scrambled eggs which were velvety rich and delicious.  I would be coming back here when I have a craving for an amazing burger!"
"Sweet baby Jesus this place is tasty.Went here for a first date. My date and I split the bone marrow, the fries with the fried egg on top, and a single burger. A few beers were had as well, beer selection is nice, but sh*t son, that burger took the cake.Bottomline, go here. It's a bit of a wait and it's easy to rack up a bill here, but it's worth every minute spent waiting and every penny spent."
"I am not usually a YELP reviewer, but this definitely deserved one. My friends and I came on a Wednesday night at 6:15 PM...yes the wait was over an hour, but it ended up being well worth it. The atomsphere was trendy and comfortable, nothing too fancy yet the feeling of an upscale place. (The music was fantastic too!)The food was awesome. My friends and I eat out a lot, we've tried a TON of new restaurants all over the city and this definitely ranks high on the list of must-go-to. My friend and I split two things; a burger and the sesame chicken wings with cilantro. The wings came first as an ""appetizer"" and were great. The flavor was the perfect combination of spicy and sweet. The burger came next which was amazing; melted in our mouths and came with a delicious sweet sauce on it. We got a side of mashed potatoes (amazing) and the bread and butter pickles. I'm a HUGE fan of bread and butter pickles and these were well worth ordering. Not too sweet as they can sometimes be.Overall, I would rate this place as great. The food and atmosphere make it a place I will definitely go back to. Thanks!"
"When you glaze upon it, it glimmers like a brideWhen you place a spoon on it, it collapses like a house of JengaWhen you blow wind on it, it jiggles like the perfect jelloI don't always eat desserts, but when I do, I will choose this puff pastry any day. It is an absolute must. Everything else is OK"
"Believe the hype - these burgers are just as good as everyone says. Something magical happens when they make them, and I think it at least partially has to do with the fried egg on top so definitely do not skip it. The fries with garlic aioli are a perfect compliment, and it's all well worth the wait. Every time I leave I feel like I won't need to eat for at least two weeks afterwards, which is all I could ever need from a burger place."
"Damn good burger. I got the single with egg and bacon. They did not mention that bacon was an extra 3.50. Also the place is very tiny and the grill heats up the joint to a point of near sweating. But delicious non the less. For a burger, I'd definitely recommend this place."
"Met two friends here on a Wednesday night at around 8pm.. They told me I would be eating the best burger of my life, and of course I was incredibly skeptical, as I am a gluttonous foodie.My friends arrived about 15 minutes before I did and informed me that we had an hour left on our hour and 15min wait.. It was abnormally warm inside so we began drinking several of craft beers on tap, none of which I recognized.. Sat down at a booth and immediately ordered. We decided to split the Crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy, which was AMAZING and filling!! We also all ordered a single cheese burger, which in actuality is a double cheese burger.. I had mine ""Au Cheval"" which literally means 'the horse,' but in their world means 'topped with an egg and two slabs of pork belly.'It was served open faced, though I picked it up with both hands and ate it like I would any other burger.. the meat was cooked perfectly and the egg yolk was orange but almost solid; no complaints but I prefer my yolks to be completely runny on my burger.3 craft beers, split of the hashbrowns, and burger came to about $40 after tip... Not too shabby for a fun dinner out.Overall, I'd say its at the top of my list for places to go for a burger and beer. And I will be returning!"
"First time here, I came for dinner. I've been hearing about this place from everyone and anyone so it was time to see what the hype was about! It was about an hour and a half wait and the staff was lovely enough to take down my number so that my friends and I could walk around the area. The hostess stayed friendly and with all the people there, I was surprised she could. A pleasant surprise indeed. Once we were inside, my friends and I were famished. Two of us opted for the single burger (with the egg of course!) and the last chose to have the chicken liver. Although I can't say much about my third friend's dish, the burger was absolutely delicious! The egg is a MUST added addition. Since I am a little sensitive to salt, it was a little much in the burger for me but nonetheless, everything else is very enjoyable. My dish was also paired with the peach cider and I have to say it's one of the best I've had. I'm a big fan of sweet drinks so for those who are not, this isn't for you. If you're not as avid a drinker of beer like I am, try this out! You're in for a sweet surprise! Why the 4 stars? Well, since this is my first time I can't say it's perfect just yet. I'll give them a couple times to earn that last star up there. (This also means I get to eat more food...definitely not complaining!) p.s. It's pretty dark so some people may need a phone light to be able to read the menu."
"Simply the best burger in Chicago. If you love burgers, then this is place to go. Tips: be prepared to wait. Lines can be 2 hours+Get the fries with an egg on topThe fried chicken is very good as wellSneaky good beer listLate night menu is different from standard menu. I believe the late night menu starts at 10pm."
"This place is amazing! Very interesting beer selection. The first beer I tried was called ""local option morning wood"" a coffee infused oak aged amber ale. It may have been the best beer I've ever had. The foie gras terrine with tart cherries was excellent. The beef stew with marrow bone was unbelievably rich and tender. For dessert I had the vanilla malt gelato with hot fudge and I tried the Belhaven Scottish Stout...creamy with tones of coffee, chocolate and roasted nut. It turned out to be a perfect pairing. I can't wait to return! Next time I want to hit the cocktail menu. There's also another dish on the menu I can't wait to try: General Tso's fried chicken with dried chili and brown sugar glaze. It looked so amazing."
"The foie gras terrine served with jam and texas toast is on my death row food list.  It is seriously one of the best things I've ever eaten.  I had a dream about it once and when I've gone too long without it, I actually miss it."
"I've been here a couple of times and it has always been good. It's a small dimly lit place with around 12-15 tables and a bar. The drinks are exceptional here as well as the food - greasy but very tasty comfort food except for the millefeuille that we had for dessert ( I personally didn't enjoy it). The bar/restaurant unfortunately doesn't take reservations so you just have to wait for a table and sometimes it can get quite busy. It's worth the wait though, I always enjoy coming here for a drink - you always see a very diverse crowd."
"I have seen this place on Foursquare as a hopping place. Came here for brunch/lunch with a friend today. We started off with a Bloody Mary and a Giulio (prosecco, grapefruit and cocchi americano). The Giulio was delicious, almost like a mimosa or Bellini but with grapefruit. Our mains were the crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy and the cheeseburger a cheval. My cheeseburger was very good and since I was hungry ate it all. I took the egg off and ate it separately. I would come back and try their muffins that they make fresh - too bad we were full, or would have had to have one. We were both surprised at the space between the kitchen and the dinign area - it was a small kitchen were they cooked and served and at the end was their bar. It was all very good."
"Au cheval is one of my absolute favorite places . First off they are open late! they are phenomenal . The burgers are awesome , fries with fried eggs delicious . My favorite : bone marrow : the best I've had for sure with toast and beef cheek marmalade so good ! Out of this world :) sesame chicken is amazing , full of flavor and matzo balls soup is just awesome on a cold winter day :)  cocktails are great too. A great spot for dinner or late night food cravings :) a must go to place in the city ! Won't be disappointed . Excellent location too !"
"On my first day to Chicago, I headed over to Au Cheval for an early dinner. I figured that getting there by 5pm was the smart thing to do, as its popularity has reached an all time high from all the reviews I've read.Luckily, my assumption was spot on as I was able to snatch a seat at the counter right across from the chefs, or quick order cooks. But this isn't your traditional diner. And these aren't your traditional short order cooks. They are churning out some special, carefully crafted, albeit it bar type food with a gourmet twist.I knew what I was ordering ahead of time, and no the signature cheesburger was not on the list. Although, seeing the nearly hundreds of burgers being cooked right in front of me throughout my meal didn't tempt me into getting one. It has been lauded by some as the best in the country, and definitely warrants a future visit.But this time, I went with the following:Thick slabs of bacon as my starter. They were bathed in maple syrup, grilled, and topped with fresh cracked pepper. Thick cut bacon seems to be all the rage these days, after Peter Luger perfected it way back when. This was a fine rendition of thick cut bacon. The portion was generous. 5 thick fatty slabs with the right ratio of fat to meat and the sweetness from the maple was the perfect match. It's like having the syrup from you french toast fall onto your bacon at breakfast. Sinfully delicious. I polished off the whole plate in 3 minutes flat it seemed, and prompted the lady sitting next to me to ask what it was. Pork belly? No, BACON.For the proper main, there was one thing that stood out to me even more than the burger. Seared foie gras and eggs? Holy shit. Two of my favorite things in one bowl. Served for dinner? Yes please! the eggs were as fluffy as can be but of course the foie gras is the draw. The foie was again, a generous 4 ounce portion according to my waiter that was cut into bit sized pieces. The whole thing had this ulta rich, incredible sauce on top of it. Like a ragu, and I am sure infused with some type of butter and foie gras reduction. Slightly sweet, but savory as well. This was one of the best dishes I had on my trip and was incredibly memorable. The buttery slices of gargantuan texas toast that came with it was perfect for dipping. For $18, it was a nice filling plate of food. I'd imagine they could charge upwards of $25 for this.As is that wasn't enough, I got a side of crispy fries with a fried egg, mornay sauce, and garlic aioli. As if you haven't caught on by now, everything here is rich. Most things are accompanied with an egg. Nothing is diet food. Everything in fattening. Lots of butter, lots of delicious. The fries were terrific, and the egg after being cut oozed into the fries to create the perfect sauce. The mornay sauce was thick and creamy and I even found myself dropping some on the toast, some in the foie and eggs, just to experiment with different tastes. I hate mayonnaise, but this aioli was anything but mayonnaissey. Another delicious dipping sauce. After awhile, I had no idea what to dip the fries in. Just the egg, the mornay, the aioli, ketchup? Who knows. But whatever I tried it wound up being effing amazing.If you're in Chicago go to Au Cheval. You won't be disappointed, although your cardiologist might not recommend it."
"Came with wife the other night and was told it would be a 2.5 hr wait.  No complaint. First time there and they were busy.  So went next door to little goat put our name down. Was told it would be about an hr.  so went to grab a cocktail at the bar and started looking at their menu, naw......   So wife decided to head back to au cheval and boom   They have two bar seats for us.     Paid for our cocktail, down it and went back to au cheval.Good vibe here. Beer selection looked good, sampled a few. Ordered the bone marrow for app.  Very impressed, first place in Chicago that did not melt the thing thru so ended up nothing much to eat.  Was told they steam them first and just brown it a little so most of the marrow would still be there.   Would prefer the thinner slice of toast instead of the thick toast.  We wanted to save room for other goodies Was recommended the porterhouse (pork).  Turned out it was one of the best pork I had sampled.  Just slightly pink and tender, juicy and went really well with the sauce and the beer.   Really enjoyed the atmosphere,  small place with good music and friendly services."
"I had dinner here with my roommate and her mom. We waited at the bar for a table (as to which we were never told how long of a wait it was) and had some beer. There was a pretty good beer list. We were seated close to 45 minutes after we put our names in at about 6:00pm on a Friday. The waitress was super knowledgeable about the menu, even though we asked probably a million annoying questions. She even let me know about a vegetarian item they offered that wasn't even on the menu (score!) Food was brought quickly, drinks were not brought so quickly. The food was delicious, especially the smashed potatoes!The atmosphere was loud and a little crowded because there was a bunch of people just waiting in the hallway in front of all the booths/in between the bar. The decor of the place is great, sort of an upscale, classy diner feel. More of a group spot than a date spot."
"I don't need to add any more reviews on the burgers Au Cheval has to offer. It's basic burger: beef patties, cheese, bun, and pickle on the side, but it's so good. The hubs got his meaty burger, and I ordered the fried chicken. The general Jane's fried chicken is wrapped in very flavorful sauce: sweet, a little bit sour and spicy with a hint of ginger. I think it is similar to the fried chicken I had at Korean restaurants. We both enjoyed the fried chicken so much (it came with 6 pieces of chicken in one order). We sat at the bar and it was very interesting and exciting to see all the actions in the kitchen."
"Love the food, love the drink list, love the ambiance, love the services, love everything here...The server was really friendly, and by the end of the night, she actually remembered our names, despite we only introduced ourselves once at the very beginning of the meal!On to the food, the matzo ball soup was the best i have had and the matzo ball is the biggest i have ever seen, but also the tastiest! they use the beef broth instead of chicken broth, added dills and some other herbs, carrots and sweet vidalia onionsthe foie gras terrine, tart cherry with toast, this is pretty good too. but nothing out of ordinarythe potatoes hash with duck heart gravy, excellent!!! You would think with the hash and gravy it would be really heavy, but it wasn't as heavy as one would think...and i personally don't like any gravy (like i would skip gravy on mashed potatoes), and i found this dish delightful and flavourful! Actually in general, i found Au Cheval's food isn't as heavy as the other similar restaurants...maybe it was because they aren't as greasy?!As for dessert, we had the stack of puff with vanilla cream. it was quite good...The ambiance kinda reminded me of an old western bar in the modern 21st century...maybe it was because as soon as i walked in, i saw the bar, and it was dark, and with an antique-looking recorder playing on the side...."
"The food was to die for.  Everything we got (chilaquilas, blueberry muffin, the mille-feuille, and the bacon) was absolutely fantastic.  My first visit there was long overdue.The decor was great, the music was good.I'm taking off two stars because of the service.  There were moments I thought I might have wandered into Ed Debevic's.  The hostess was incredibly rude, not just to me, but I heard at least two other parties talking among themselves about the same issue.  Our waitress was marginally better, but was cold and somewhat unfriendly (as compared to openly hostile).  After I had been in there five minutes, I'd pledged never to go back.  The food might make me break that pledge to myself."
"Are you freaking kidding me?That was what went through my head when I bit in to Au Cheval's ever-so-talked-about cheeseburger.  It is that good.  Actually, it's better.  Someone told us it was the best burger he's ever had, and frankly I can't argue that.What's good about it?  Well, it's two thin patties of beef (I've realized that I do have a preference for thinner burgers than the thicker kind - so this could color your experience if you prefer an inch thick patty) season perfectly, a perfect amount of cheese, a slightly greasy bun which holds up to the burger, dijonaise, and pickles.  On mine, I had them hold then onion and add an egg ('au cheval' style, as they say) and it's just a delightful combination.  This is what a burger should be.  And while it doesn't look that big, I couldn't finish my whole burger - which, a day later, I am STILL sad about.  It just tasted so good...Also good?  We got the fries with garlic aioli and a side of sweet pickles.  Both were outstanding, and the pickles helped cut the richness of the burger and fries a bit.  Definitely would get both again, but be sure to split the sides - there's plenty to go around.  In fact, we had plenty of these leftover as well.We managed to snag a couple seats at the bar, which allowed us to get served pretty quickly.  Interestingly, you still get a server if you sit at the bar rather than ordering from the bartender.  It's kind of nice that the bartender is just making drinks, you know?  Our server was Mark I think?  Anyway, he was great - very nice, attentive without being annoying, and patient with us Au Cheval newbies.A super fun thing about Au Cheval?  They don't have a corkage fee if you bring your own wine, but they do 'charge' you by making you give away one glass of the wine you brought.  Even more fun?  I was the lucky winner of a glass of someone else's wine last night!  Just when you think things can't get better, well, they do."
"The place has tiny booths but any booth is a good one, except John Wilkes amirite?Ok, I'll admit, that was bad. Like Jeff Dunham bad, but this will be the 66th review I've written today and my creative well is starting to dry up a bit.  And also while we're being totally honest, I was a little drunk when I went here and the only thing I wrote in my Yelp check-in ""notes and tips"" section was that the booths were tiny.  I can corroborate this fact with a photo on Facebook that shows my girlfriend, my friend and me trying to eat on one side of the table aptly titled, ""T-Rex Dining"" because our arms were forcibly pinned to our sides.At this point I'm sure many of you are yelling at your screen for me to get to the f#$%ing food/atmosphere already. To which I reply that you should really relax and a Yelp review is not something that should evoke such unadulterated rage in you.  Perhaps you should see someone. You should never be ashamed to seek help, and these rage issues of yours are something that needs to be dealt with before you hurt yourself or someone you care about.I still haven't said one thing about the food you say? Ok, I remember it was delicious and everything had an egg on it, but quite frankly I'm so terrified of your recent outburst that I think it's best for everyone if we both take 5 and chill out."
"Great atmosphere. Best burger in the city of Chicago. Fried chicken is amazing. If you're thinking of going here, just go, don't hesitate. It is fantastic."
"I went here recently with my dad who is a big fan and definitely was won over.  The general feel of the place is as a hipster diner.  The decor is great, the staff is friendly, and the food even better. One of the best things about this place is the beer list.  They have a great selection of craft beers on tap and even though they are a bit on the expensive side, they're tasty and well worth it.  The menu is fairly limited but that's fine because what's on the menu is delicious.  My dad had the fried bologna sandwich which is his favorite and was once again not disappointed.  I had the burger which was wonderful.  It was actually one of the best burgers that I've had.  The meat was wonderful, the cheese terrific, and the other compliments did their job of complimenting everything beautifully.  My dad and I shared the duck hash browns which are a must try.  If you enjoy duck you definitely have to have them.  Though pricey, this place is worth every penny."
"Came here for a late Friday night dinner and expected to wait at least 30 minutes. We were seated in less than 5. WIN #1.  They had a shot of whiskey with pickle-back If you've never done a whiskey shot with pickle-back, try it and thank me later. We ordered 2. WIN #2. There is a fried bologna sandwich on the menu WIN #3. Duck Heart Gravy Hash Browns WIN #4 and 5. It was so good it deserves 2 WINS. Long story short, the food was very tasty, service was great, and the beer selection was great as well. Now excuse me while I go eat this damn fried bologna sandy, its been starring at me."
"This place is hands down the best burger you'll find anywhere.  My personal favorite is a single (really a double) cheeseburger, au cheval (which means ""on horseback"" but in the culinary sense means with an egg on top), and peppered bacon.  The fries au cheval are incredible too, and come with delicious aioli and gravy dipping sauces.  If you like mashed potatoes, you'll be hard pressed to find any that are better than these.  If you can get in for brunch, my favorite is the scrambled eggs with foie gras and a bloody mary.  The beer selection is impressive too.You're almost always guaranteed a wait, but they'll take your cell phone number and you can grab a drink nearby until they text you.  I hate to say anything bad about this place because I love it so much and eat here all the time, but my two issues with Au Cheval are their Chilaquiles and how absurdly long it takes to get a drink. The Chilaquiles were enticing to me because they are only served after midnight, and all of the food their is so good.  Unfortunately they were very disgusting breakfast nachos, that I couldn't even get down after several beers.  They were just plain bad... especially for $18.  The other issue is the drink service.  It blows my mind that it takes them as long as it does to pour a beer out of one of their 20+ taps and bring it to the table.  We always put our drink order in as soon as we sit down because we know how long it takes for them to get it to us, and its disappointing that the majority of the time we get our food before our drinks.  Not to mention that you'll be so engulfed in scarfing down your food by the time you get it, that you'll be wondering why you even ordered your $11 beer.Anyway, great drink and beer selection, great music, great atmosphere, hospitable staff, and INCREDIBLE food.  Even with my two caveats, I gladly give Au Cheval 5 stars, and recommend it to everyone."
"You guys never disappoint.  Had the bone marrow and beef cheek marmalade for lunch.  Every bit melted In my mouth truly.  You guys are truly amazing, thanks for a great lunch :)"
"I have been coming to au cheval since about 2 months after it opened, and by now have been there way too many times to count.  The whole menu which I've had about 90% of is excellent.  Service is usually pretty good, can be slow, but they are always busy.  Music is loud, but in great taste, playing everything from daft punk, to beastie boys, to notorious b.i.g.  Dimly lit, with the bar doubling as the open kitchen.  The reason it turned into an after work hangout so quickly is the fact that the late night menu is running until 1am every day, and they close at 2am every day.  The beer list rotates very offend, and is always interesting.  Late night menu IS a little small, but it has the only thing you need on there.  The burger here at au cheval is my favorite in Chicago.  Very simple, single or double burger.  The single has 2 patties, and the double has 3 patties.  4 ounces each and cooked to a perfect medium everytime, comes with perfect melty cheese, housemade bread and butter pickles, and their house mayo.  You also have the option to get the burger ""au cheval"" style with a perfect egg, and/or with thick cut house cured bacon.  No matter how you get it, your making a good decision.As for the rest of the menu, there is not a weak point at all.  I love their bone marrow setup here which comes with crispy bread and beef cheek marmalade.  Some of my other favorites are the crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy, the foie and pork stuffed cabbage, the chicken liver, and general Janes honey fried chicken.  The honey fried chicken is a beautiful fried chicken interpretation.  Very"
"This place is popular.  We encountered a 30 minute wait for 2 during the Sunday dinner rush.  No big deal, we hopped over to Haymarket for a beer because they will text you when your table is ready!The diner is small and dimly lit which makes it super cozy and sort of romantic feeling.  Each staff member we encountered was so friendly, really the service was exemplary.  We sat at a table in the back and ordered some craft brews, a seef and an upright #7.  We started with a salad- pickled shallot and sherry vinagrette- it was amazing.  Next up the chili con carne and corn chips.  It was very spicy but too good to stop eating.  We also each ordered a single cheeseburger and they were hot off the griddle, juicy beef with perfectly melty cheese and some amazing pickle mayo topping.  Now if we had been paying attention, we would have noticed all the other couples in the place sharing one burger.  Next time!Thankfully, I'm a true fat kid at heart, so even though we had more than enough food, we obviously still needed dessert.  I asked if they had an ice cream sundae, and the waitress said no, but they did make root beer floats.  Enter the most amazing dessert ever.  I'm still dreaming about this one. I don't know what type of ice cream it was, not vanilla but better.Can't wait for another visit! Kudos to the team at Au Cheval, our experience was a real winner."
"Most people love this place--I did not.  We had excellent service and were seated quickly at 630 on a Saturday.  Excellent wine list and cocktail offering.  Other than the great salad, we did not care for the food--it all had a weird taste--the chicken, the duck heart, the roasted tomatos.  The matzo ball soup was cold, the matzo balls were huge and tasty.  We totally over ordered and the waitress encouraged us to get even more--totall upsell.  I don't know what else to say--it was just not for me.  The excellent sound track is sourced form a TEAC reel-to-reel. I would return for a burger and fries wih a beer"
"This is one of the few restaurants that I go back to.  Their drinks are amazing, and there's nothing I've eaten there I haven't loved.  The burger is insanely amazing, and yo can't go wrong with their fries.  Their fish is delicious.  Their eggs are delicious.  Even their toast is amazing.  The hostess is always very friendly.  The service is just as good as the food."
"Great burger and fries. The rest of the menu looked promising as well.  The place is intimate and many of the seats are at the bar. This a great spot on a cold night as the heat from the griddle behind the bar provides warmth and entertainment! However, you will walk out with a lingering smell of burger on your clothes. I really enjoyed the ambiance and the playlist on a Friday night. It was crowded with an extensive wait but there are multiple options close by for drinks and appetizers."
I came here for the first time a week or so ago and I am still not sure how I feel about it. The ambiance is alright--- but it gets REALLY crowded. I was really uncomfortable even at my seat at the bar while I waited for a table. We got there early--- at like 5:30 on a Friday---and we still had a 45 minute wait. Be prepared! Our server was great. She knew everything about the menu as if she designed it and selected the ingredients herself. I was so impressed. I had the burger which was quite good. I'm not sure I would say it was the best but I definitely enjoyed it. Everyone in my group seemed to enjoy their food. The drink menu is pretty good. They had a good beer selection. I will be back but definitely not on a Friday or Saturday night.
"The sign on the door says this is a diner. I didn't see a menu, but nothing I saw made me feel like it was a diner. Some friends and I had reservations across the street at The Girl and the Goat, so it seemed like a good idea to met an hour early to have some drinks at 'The Horse.' When we arrived  (8pm on a Saturday night) we found the place to be filled. The hostes informed us that they were seating people for dinner at the bar, but if we just wanted to have drinks we could stand near the bar, kind of in the way of servers and bus-staff. So we did that. Their selection of beverages seemed robust. I had a pear cider on tap, the ladies had prosecco, and my pal had a beer of some sort. One other thing I'd like to mention is that the music was being played via a 1/4-inch reel to reel deck (Tandberg, I believe), which struck me as cool and hilarious.In summation, the place seemed fine. I would've been happier sitting down, but that's nobody's fault really. Had we been there to eat, we would've been seated."
"The English Breakfast is the best brunch meal I've ever had, bar none. The thing I love about it is the number of components that are so, so good. The eggs are super creamy and fluffy. The baked beans are rich and smokey. The bacon is thick and peppery. The texas toast is light, crunchy and with just the right amount of butter. And the tomato is sooo flavorful and a perfect counterpoint to the richness of the rest of the plate. Plus, my DC got the cheeseburger and gave me a bite. It is AMAZING. Thin patties, tons of cheese, buttery bun. It's like an elevated In-N-Out burger, and that's saying a lot given that I adore I&O. The fries with eggs and Bernaise are also amazing. GO HERE.ADDENDUM: There is NO WAIT for a table at 11 am on a Sunday. WTF people. Leave Publican right now and walk yourself over."
AMAZING. The food and the service are both excellent. I go here whenever I'm craving a delicious burger. The single cheeseburger is more than enough food for me. I always end up eating only half of it and saving the other half for later. The fries with garlic aioli and mornay sauce are a must. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because there's always a couple hour wait to get in for dinner and around 30 minutes for lunch. It is definitely worth the wait if you have the time though!
"Really was looking forward to eating here and to be fair I will split review in 2.  Our food was so good I want to go back tomorrow.  Began with a rye mixed drink that was delicious - Next the bacon appetizer melted in my mouth and then of course the burger with cheese n more bacon!! Everything was wonderful with the exception of our angry, tattooed, pierced, unhelpful server.  It was as if she was doing us a favor waiting on us.  I was a server in the past and here's a clue - try having a conversation and smiling. VERY disappointing.  Food great - Service not so"
"I live unfortunately close to Au Cheval. Unfortunate only because I now go here at least once a week and it is definitely making me fat... but I will happily accept that extra fat because it comes in the form of the most amazing cheeseburger ever. I have tried pretty much everything on the menu at this point and it's all amazing. If you've never been here before you could easily close your eyes, blindly point to something on the menu and I guarantee you'll enjoy it. You couldn't pay me to say something bad about this place. Well, except that it's making me fat."
"Double burger, brat and mash, hash browns, and fries are somethin serious up in here.  Good eats and played good music.  Only thing is the place is a little small and the wait was an 1 and 1/2 hours at 5pm on a Saturday."
Excellent cheeseburger and fries!  Expect a wait...even at 4:45pm on a Sunday we had a 30 min wait.  Decent beer list as well.  Reasonably priced for such a high quality of food. :)  I'll be back.
"DELICIOUS!It took me awhile to make a decision on what to eat here. Everything sounded delectable making it difficult to decide. I eventually settled on the General Jane Chicken. We ended up sharing a plate of their fries and the husband ordered a double cheeseburger. I shouldn't have eaten anything before coming here, but I've certainly learned my lesson. The chicken was amazing. I very much enjoyed the honey sesame glaze and was amazed at how much I ate. Side note: I finished all but one piece right before two ladies sat next to us. They ended up sharing the dish and taking home most of it. Yikes! The sauces that accompanied the fries were not my favorite. I would have been much happier with ketchup. The burger was extremely heavy. It also didn't seem to be any better than any other diner prepared burger. It was good, nonetheless. I washed my meal down with a rootbeer float which could not have been more delicious. This is not your average diner. It definitely deserves the high-end diner distinction. I am impressed and plan to come back sometime soon."
"Came to Chicago for a business trip, and was looking for a place that had 1) a good beer selection 2) good atmosphere 3) no limited bar menu, and 4) was close to my hotel. Au Cheval hit all four. Cool bartender and attentive server made this a very good experience. Place was hopping on a Monday night and had a good mix of people that made me feel at home (SF) - just in 7 degree weather. They have a very good craft and Belgian beer selection and while the menu isn't deep, my cheeseburger was solid."
"The good news...the food was fantastic. Everything else was not so good.  The wait was long but I expected that. Once our order was taken, our waitress didn't come back for about a half hour. When she did, it was just to tell us ""they"" lost our ticket. Well whoever ""they"" are ruined a great afternoon lunch.  Normally I would have spoken to management but the group I was with didn't want to make a scene. My pal grabbed the bill and paid it before anyone choose to acknowledge me.  Again, delicious burger, but they don't seem to care about customer service."
"This place has always been worth the wait for the sake of the food, but the attitude of the staff is getting intolerable. Let me preface this scathing review by saying that the single cheeseburger Au Cheval+Bacon is easily the best burger in the United States of America.My first four times to the restaurant I ordered a single cheeseburger Au Cheval, which was explained to me on my first visit to come with egg and bacon. Each time I ordered the sandwich ""Au Cheval"" it came with bacon and egg. They were fantastic. My most recent trip to the restaurant, the burger ""Au Cheval"" came with only egg, and when I asked about why, I was smugly informed that this was the way it always was and got a lecture on the French language. Ma'am, I'm not sure what naming a menu add-on after a horse has to do with an egg, but really I could have been spared the lecture. The final bill came to the same amount, which means that there is some poor communication, which is on the servers, but what is going to make me think twice about returning is the attitude of the staff. Au Cheval, please allow your staff to live up to the quality of your food."
"If you're going to come here- there will be a wait and it will definitely be worth it. It's going to a be a little pricey, but that burger that so deliciously melts in your mouth will be so so worth it. Those fries.. Those pickles.. That beer. It's all so wonderfully executed. Set aside the less than excited hostesses and just enjoy your meal! I don't know that I would ever be disappointed by the food here. This is hands down the best burger I've ever had."
"Great vibe, cool music and we thought sitting at the bar was a great way to take it all in.  This place sits on a cool Chicago corner and they even have the reel to reel going just like in my Dad's basement.  The Cheeseburger was a total home run.  A perfect blend of seasonings, grease, american cheese, pickles and a soft bun.   The mashed potato side with gravy was also a hit.  I will definitely be back."
"We give Au Cheval 3.5 stars.  We visited on a busy late Saturday morning. While frenetic and small I would say they are exceptionally kid-friendly due to them being highly accommodative of our 9 month old and our large baby stroller. The hostess was willing to help in the friendliest manner possible and she should be commended. Take your kids and all of your gear, you won't be disappointed!The food was quite tasty - I got the chilaquiles and my better half got the spinach blue cheese and carmelized onion omelet. I would say that the chilaquile regular portion was huge -- I can't imagine how big the large size is. The side of bacon was pretty awesome although at $9 not cheap. I also didn't understand the regular coffee order - you have to lock into a whole French press of coffee for somewhere close to $10 -- it was a good thing my friend with us was a coffee drinker as well. I'd rather have hot coffee refilled along the way on an individual basis. Not our favorite brunch joint in the area but we'd probably go back. Haven't tried dinner."
"When there's a two hour wait when you walk into a place, you start building some expectations. Is this place worth it? The dark room stretches to a corner, background music plays from a vintage reel-to-reel player behind the hostess as she deftly handles the line crowded around from the edge of the bar to the vestibule.We had a full appetizer and set of drinks across the street at the Haymarket before we got seated with menus at our booth. Our very dark booth, mind you. The kind of place where you can barely see in front of you without feeling out for it. It was a little challenging to order with the complete lack of light, but it was managed. Another round of beers was handed out with our appetizer fries that we were handily recommended. Then our meals for the day. The ""ham and cheese"" fondue. The fried chicken. The burger. And the ""bologna"" sandwich.Oh next rich series of artery-clogging, blood pressure raising bites. No hint of vegetation anywhere near any of these plates, as course for course, starches and grains on top of fried pork with cheese was handed to us. No refreshment provided with a hint of acid or produce. Well yes, could have ordered a salad, but it doesn't quite counterbalance the onslaught of rich provisions offered to us. Of course, for what it was, it was all actually quite good. Especially with the penchant for fried eggs on top that Au Cheval considers its namesake.Though good, this place doesn't quite live up to the hype, as the meal was unbalanced to the point of leaving me feeling heavy and well greased up for the next week. But if you're into it, be my guest."
"Excellent food, good service, but the music is so loud you the servers can't hear you. Very crowded."
"Great spot, and as the others posted, the burger is unbelievable. Went for brunch and got seated close to closing but the first waitress was amazing, she was funny, friendly and helpful answering questions. We then got another server and it's because of her this review is 4 instead of 5. Being a group of 5 and half of us from another country I asked to split the bill in the beginning to make it easier on the server. For some reason asking for separate bills seemed like the biggest chore ever and the response was, "" Well it's actually going to take longer for me."" We weren't planning on moving, there were 5 of us and splitting the bill from the beginning is traditionally easier. Throughout the whole meal the 2nd waitress was just blah but the 1st one swung by and we eventually ordered from her because she was just amazing. The food was great, big portions, small and tight menu. For those adventurous eaters it's a gem, for those who have food issues I wouldn't suggest the place. Its a great place for the fierce and fearless. Good cocktails too."
"Went to Au Cheval late on a Thursday night around 1 am. Had a party of 6 people and we got luck y and got a table after a a short stop at the bar.Hands down, had the MOST amazing cheeseburger ever. Phenomenal really. There's no way to describe this other than it was delicious and cheesy and hot.I would fly to Chicago just for the cheeseburger. The beer was excellent too! Insanely delicious."
"I went here a few weeks ago and the food was delicious. I got the burger with the egg on it and split the fries and honestly dreamed about it for many days after. That being said, my parents are flying in tonight to visit and I thought they would adore Au Cheval. I was almost positive that Au Cheval didn't take reservations, but thought to call anyways and see if I could get an idea of the wait, because my parents wouldn't want to wait-due to the jet lag and typical travel exhaustion. The hostess from Au Cheval was extremely rude to me on the phone, even laughing at me when I asked what the wait was the past few days at night. She had a snobby tone to her voice, and made it seem like Au Cheval was too ""above"" friendliness.That being said, because of the rude hostess, I will never go back to this restaurant. No matter how amazing the food was-which is a shame. In Chicago, theres a dozen other burger restaurants that are just as posh and delicious, but come with a side of GOOD hospitality!"
"Gastropub glory.On a recent trip to Chicago, I met with a pair of offal-minded individuals at Au Cheval to partake in a variety of overwhelming organ meats.After about an hour wait, we saddled up at one of the well appointed booths and ordered the chopped chicken liver, roasted marrow bones and crispy potato hash with duck gravy.It's sometimes difficult to describe with accuracy the flavors, texture and smells of excellently prepared sweetbreads.  Smokey, smooth, rich, delicate, indulgent - are just a few words that come to mind.  The bottomline is that everything is expertly prepared, cooked and presented.  Au Cheval has elevated ""pub grub"" to brand new heights and something tells me they're never looking back.Well worth the wait."
"Best Burger Ever!!! Walked in after a 3 hour kayak trip wearing Swim trunks and probably smelling less than great. We were greeted with an extremely warm welcome and told we needed some ""Pickle Backs"" (whiskey shots chased by pickle juice). We gladly consumed the shots, followed by another 2-3 rounds. The food was phenomenal, the beers list was different from what I was used to in Texas but, the staff was great about finding something we would enjoy. The setlist of music is unique and fun too. I Will be going back every time I am in Chicago."
Best restaurant in Chicago for the $$$. Make sure you get there early bc the list fills up to over an hour. I enjoy the small venue as it adds to the ambiance. My roommates and I frequent it a lot
"My friends and I went au cheval after seeing all the amazing reviews it had. The fried chicken was AMAZING, a must have!!! We also LOVED the mashed potatoes with garlic gravy and the fries with the garlic aioli.  As for the burger, we were not quite impressed. The bacon was more like Canadian bacon (AKA ham) and the egg was not cooked enough. The meat was average, nothing special. I will definitely be back but not for the burger."
Best burger in Chicago!!!! I ordered the double cheeseburger and it was the best thing I ever had in my life. The burger melted in my mouth! I also tried the bone marrow with the jelly and it was amazing! I would get that as an appetizer every time. We went there at 5:00 o clock on a Wednesday and was seated immediately!!  I recommended this place to anyone who has some taste buds!!!!
"Love the concept here. Tiny spot, great vibe, interesting dishes. Expect an hour+ wait in a crushed alcove + bar area. Much better experience: plan to go during an off hour or day, especially since you will want to dig into their food + drinks as soon as possible upon arriving. An authentic gem with well-earned cred in a neighborhood of standout restaurants."
"Best burger in Chicago?  Yep.  I've now had it 3 times and can't wait to go back.  I took my visiting brother their a couple weeks ago for lunch on Saturday and he begged to go back on Sunday.Best burger is a strong statement.  Its right up there with Minetta Tavern, Corner Bistro, and the other NYC hot spots.Get the Bloody Mary to start.  Their house made pickles are amazing."
"When I moved to Chicago in the West Loop, I was immediately recommended Au Cheval. So, my move in day, my family and I decided that we must start the Chicago life off with a great restaurant on Randolph. We drove there and don't be deceived by the street parking, it's all valet (even though we parked ourselves). We dropped my dad off 20 minutes earlier to put our name in and he sat up at the bar and made himself comfortable. He schmoozed with the cooks and the hosts as you sit right infront of the barbeques. He loved this front row seat! He immediately ordered the griddled bratwurst and by the time we got to the restaurant, he had only saved us the tiniest sliver. He must have liked it, eh? Yes, he did, real nice of him to save us some ;). When the rest of our party showed up they sat us right away, which was awesome! We have heard all about the burgers and how they are the best in the world so all 4 of us almost just ordered the same burger, but then I wasn't having it. I needed to try more! So we ordered - General Jane's Honey Fried Chicken - Wow. This was an amazing spin on fried chicken. The coating was to die for and the portion was huge. - Crispy Fries with the Egg - Why wouldn't you get these?! Awesome. My thoughts at this restaurant- the more egg the better! - And finally, a few of the single cheeseburgers with an egg and thick cut bacon - Let me tell you, this was the thickest and best bacon I have ever had. You would think with the bacon being so thick that it would be fatty, but it was pure delicious bacon (my mouth is watering thinking about it). You also would think how the hell am I supposed to fit this all in my mouth? Believe me, you make it work and everything on the burger works together is amazing. You need the egg. You need the bacon. You will not regret. I can now honestly say this was the best burger of my life. Of. My. Life. (Again, mouth watering thinking about it). Burgers are sometimes hard to finish when they're that big; you will have no problem with this one as you cannot help yourself it is so good.My dad could not stop say ""wow"" the entire meal- after every bite, and that says a lot as he is not a fan of eating out at restaurants- especially after a long long day of moving! You can only imagine that we had to order a wheelbarrow to roll us out... we did and we were not ashamed."
"Love Au Cheval!! From the food to the atmosphere to the staff, top notch. We had the crispy fries, the burger, and the bologna sandwich...all excellent. My fav however was the Ham & Cheese Fondue. SO GOOD!! Definitely will go back for more :)"
"I give it 3.5 stars, I got the burger and a couple of there craft beers.    The beer selection was amazing.  I thought the burger was good, but very overpriced, especially since fries were not included.   I got it with the bacon, which was tasty, but it was $16 with out fries.  3 aces Burger is way better and cheaper.I also got the dessert, which was good, but also overpriced, it was $12.All in all, a good place but not as good as other places."
"This is an excellent restaurant, a one of a kind eating experience in Chicago. I remember taking the Green Line there in December and it was 15' or so and I was wondering, ""This restaurant better be worth this cold."" It was ... and then some. Where to start? It is small, but laid out in a unique way. The bartenders might have also been the cooks so you can usually watch them prepare your food. The alcohol selection was pretty standard, and I don't drink much, but they seemed to have a pretty strong cocktail selection. The music was amazing - a reel-to-reel player with quite an eclectic variety of music. And the food was delicious. My sister and I shared the matzoh ball soup and we also had hamburgers. Very, very good food, great ambience and a true gem in Chicago on the West Loop."
"Best hamburgers hands down in chicago (sorry Kuma's) perfectly tender buns and juicy beef patty with a nice cold beer and the BEST english breakfast ever....looks so simple and unassuming but all components (perfectly scrambled eggs, best baked beans ever,  perfect toast, awesome thick cut peppered bacon!!) are just perfection!"
"We had been wanting to try this place since it opened.  Mom's visit was the perfect opportunity.  We arrived around 7:00 on a Saturday and waited about 15 minutes for a table to open up.  The place was smaller than I had imagined.  It's a diner in the sense that it has a counter where you can watch the cooks flip burgers behind and booths line the walls.  But the dim lights and music make it a bar.  Mom had the open faced cheese fondue and ham sandwich with a fried egg.  It was cheesy eggy goodness.  It's not a sandwich.  The fondue/ham/egg is served in a dish and slices of bread are served on the side for sopping.  I got the fried chicken wings.   Very tasty, with an Asian flavor but it is just a bowl of chicken wings.  Hubby got the short rib ""stew"" with bone marrow.  The bone marrow was a bit difficult to extract and, other than adding saltiness, seemed out of place.  The stew had red potatoes and came with the same great bread that my mom had.  For dessert we had a flaky puff pastry with layers of French custard, although the root beer floats we saw going by looked wonderful.We were most impressed by the service.  Our waitress was delightful.  All in all, a fun experience for warm comfort food.  I would be interested to try it out late night."
"God. This place is so fucking pretentious. I got the burger with bacon and a fried egg on top. The supposedly greatest burger in chicago...Yeah. Well it sucks. It has the flavor of fat and grease. Dont get me wrong. Fat and grease taste awesome, but not when you are paying $15 for a burger. I can get it from any fast food restaurant for a third of the price.So why is it so pretentious? Well they charge $4 for a coffee and over $15 for a crappy burger, but worst off is their general attitude. I got to witness one server tell another server who didnt give the correct order 'to get the fuck out of his face.' I usually dont care about shit like this but the guy was being a douche and did not handle it well.Well, like almost every trendy west loop restaurant this place is over priced and over hyped. I am curious to know how many critics they paid off to give this place glowing reviews. I am also curious to know why the followers give this place such glowing reviews when it really doesnt offer much. I guess you should never trust stupid people in large numbers. Try not be offended if i just insulted you. Its the internet, get in line."
"We really enjoyed our meal here. They don't take reservations and we didn't want to wait too long so we went early (5:00 on a Saturday!) and had no trouble getting a table. By the time we left (6:30ish) the wait was about an hour.We were seated for about 15 minutes before anyone came and talked to us but once the server came over, service was great. I had the bologna sandwich- it was delicious but I could only eat about half of it. It's kinda of salty so I just couldn't make it through. The burger was also good but I don't think I'd go so far as to name it the best burger in the city.Our favorite part was the cocktails- delicious daiquiris and how can you go wrong with pickle backs?   The food is relatively cheap compared to the alcohol and we ended up spending way more on drinks than on food. Oops.Next time I'll have to after midnight to try the chilaquiles."
"I came here to celebrate a good friend's birthday on a Saturday evening. We were a group of about 15, and as Au Cheval does not take reservations or accommodate large parties we were split up into smaller groups with staggered seating. I was lucky enough to be part of the group that was seated first! There was maybe an initial wait of half an hour, and another half hour difference between when we were seated and the last folks in our groups were- pretty reasonable, I thought.Between the four of us we shared five really great dishes and a dessert. My personal favorite was the burger- two perfectly griddled, moist patties with melted cheddar cheese and a tangy Dijon and mayonnaise sauce. Gah. I had been fixin' for a goooood burger, and this one was SO satisfying. However, Au Cheval has so many innovative, fun dishes that I wouldn't necessarily recommend the burger first.  I would say instead to try the foie gras and pork-stuffed cabbage, which was my next favorite- super flavorful with a wonderful sweet sauce. The foie gras was stellar. I'm not a huge liver fan but still managed to enjoy the chopped chicken liver with salted butter and toast, and I know it's a bit silly but my friends and I were really in love with the toast! The crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy and fried bologna sandwich were yummy as well. And finally, the millefeuille for dessert- airy puff pastry and lovely cream, plus the server's little surprise after she had set it down on our table made us gasp haha!4.5 stars, actually- .5 off for the service, which was a bit off throughout the evening. A food  runner brought us the wrong dish and, five minutes later, did the same to our friends at the next table. Our server was unfriendly and not very attentive or interested, although my water was constantly refilled by someone or another throughout the evening. The waitstaff as a whole seemed overwhelmed and scattered, which is understandable for a very busy night in a fairly new restaurant. Still, thoroughly enjoyed the food and my evening =)"
"Loud music, fantastic food and decor I'd describe as ""hip diner."" I'm told there is always a wait (we waited 90 mins on a Thursday evening). The place is a bit of an oddity - loud hardcore rap in the background while we read from a modernized French menu. And later they moved on to Pink Floyd...I think Pandora is playing tricks on them. The bone marrow was good, just don't smell it - it has a distinctly recognizable earthy aroma that we had only smelled one other place before (something only adults would be familiar with)...but we kept on eating. The fries with an egg and garlic aioli  and the cheeseburger are a must. We were full and still managed to polish off both...they are amazing! They also have a Greek white wine whichvpairs nicely with the marrow. Go. You will not be dissappointed!"
"Upon walking in, it was strangely familiar...It took a textversation with Carmen G. to realize that this place is Sodikoff owned... DUH! It looks like a mini Gilt Bar on the inside... Anyways we got there at 4:30p on a random Wednesday. They don't serve dinner until 5p so they told us to order a drink and hang. So I ordered the Pegu Club and my dude orders a 3 Floyds. So, the menu lists the Pegu Club under the ""Strong Drinks"" category and damn, they weren't kidding!! A *half* of one and I was wasted. Haha no joke- BUT, to be fair I just had a baby and my tolerance sucks.  I had to get my husband to help me finish it...OK the food. We over-ordered:-Bone Marrow - Yum-Foie Gras Terrine - Yum-Burger with housemade bacon -Yum-Fries with the Mornay Sauce and Garlic Aioli WITH the fried egg - YumEverything was good/cooked well. Bone marrow cooked well, Foie terrine was deeeeelish and rich, burger was juicy and I appreciated the housemade bacon (it was awesome, def recommend), and the fries were good. I will be back!!"
"My family owns the best burgers in Milwaukee.. when I moved to Chicago I didn't think I would find a place I liked as much as my family's... Until I went to Au Cheval.  Such a good burger with great flavor!!  The atmosphere is upscale and loungy, you don't feel like you're in a rush to eat and get out.  The drinks are also a plus at this establishment.I'm pretty sure I had a burger 3 times in 3 weeks  :)"
"Came here for the first time last night. The food was incredible. The atmosphere was kickin. Our server, Erin was one of the best servers I've ever had. She knew her food, checked in on us, and put up with me and my crazy parents. She recommended the Chop Salad- it was honestly the best salad Ive ever had. Definitely coming back!"
"Finally got a chance to try this place, and it lives up to the hype in my opinion. The menu has a number of very interesting items that I am sure are great, but I had to try the burger. My friend and I both got the Cheeseburger with a fried egg on top, and we both agree that it was one of the best, if not the best, burger we had every had. The thick bacon on the side is also very worth it, very flavorful and cooked perfectly. My only qualm is that this place is small, to the point where it is very hard to maneuver around the restaurant. Overall though I would highly recommend this place for anyone in the mood for some great American food."
"Really great diner food in a bougie style!  I was privileged enough to be seated at the bar so I could see all the food being prepared, which was interesting and a nice change of pace.  I began by sharing an order of frites with my girlfriend, which were topped by a perfectly fried egg (and also came with aioli and a gravy).  Having multiple ""sauce options"" was a plus.  For my entree, I got a fried bologna sandwich, which basically melted in my mouth and also covered my hands with grease.  For dessert, I got scoops of Black Dog gelato in three flavors, which came in a huge portion but was fantastic.  I probably would have been alright with a single scoop, but I didn't realize that was an option until a couple down the bar ordered it.My girlfriend's scrambled eggs and foie gras had VERY generous portions of foie gras, which is a refreshing change from what I usually see with foie gras dishes.  Au Cheval delivers a lot of value for the money.Overall, I really liked the combination of casual atmosphere and good food, and there was a lot of care taken with the presentation of everything (especially given the fact that it was a diner).  I would recommend getting there early or being prepared to wait, since we arrived shortly after the kitchen opened for dinner and the tables completely filled right after us."
"Yum.Aside from the waiting area that feels VERY small on a crowded Saturday night and the 2 hour wait for a table, it was a perfect outing for my husband's birthday.The food is delicious (best hamburger I've eaten in a long time) and the dessert was perfect. The drink list is unique and tasty. The servers were attentive and given the ridiculously long wait, we were given a couple of things as compliments, which made the experience even better. I was with my SIL who is a vegetarian and they brought her an ""off menu"" grilled cheese that she loved.It's loud and dark, but oh so good. I rarely RARELY say this, but I think it was worth the wait (though next time I'll plan ahead a bit better and arrive earlier or later). I'll definitely plan to go back and now want to try the sister restaurants."
"I'm on the hunt for the best burger in Chicago, and this place was recommended. Needless to say, I was not disappointed! The single is actually 2 burger patties and the double has three! We ordered it both ways, including one with the egg and bacon. They were all delicious, if not a bit over-salted. I really liked the burgers here, but alas, would not say it was the best burger in Chicago.The fries with the fried egg were fantastic as well, but again, over-salted. The best item ordered however was the bone marrow. Now, I'm not a big bone marrow fan typically, but this one was incredible! It came with this brisket-ey slaw on the side, that paired with the marrow was to die for. Lastly, the drinks were great. The bartender made a fantastic old fashioned that hit the spot.It was a bit of a wait for the 4 of us (over an hour on a Sunday!), but I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would go again."
"This place is nice. It's almost a perfect kind of place for me. It seems to do the simple things really well like a burger and fries or an omelet and it balances being low brow with a sophisticated sensibility. The bacon is off the charts and the staff were amongst the best I've had anywhere.While I didn't have a drink at the bar (it was tempting- but it was a workday) I look forward to going back for a drink and some great service, food and ambiance.Great coffee too!"
"Besides having a very ""cool"" atmosphere, the burger from Au Cheval may just be the best burger I have ever had.  It's worth it just to go there and have this burger.  They have an extensive beer menu as well.  It's in a pretty trendy area, but not busy enough that you can't find street parking.  It's also close the green and pink lines."
"Had the burger it was good but the best? I'm not sure about that. I like the ambiance bc it's dark, cozy and you can watch the chefs cook. Not a place to eat before going out for the night bc you leave smelling like the kitchen. I'd go back."
"Would I wait three hours for this place? Not really. But it was fun to try.In essence it's a diner, that at the same time, is anything but a diner. It's small, dimly lit, and always crowded. This will never be your go-to, whole-in-the-wall, quaint place to grab breakfast and a coffee. It will, however, be a reloading zone for hipsters and a place where you can soak up grease for days. While no waiver is required to eat here, the mammoth burger and all its accouterments are delicious and gut-busting. Make sure you have no plans with a new significant other when you're done eating and that you are preferably near modern plumbing.Bon Appetit magazine named it the best burger ever. I say Acadia's burger with bacon jam and homemade thousand island blows it out of the water. Other than that, the need-to-knows are: very limited seating and that fries, burger, drink = $33. I didn't barely got to first base with it."
If burgers is your thing....this place is a MUST!Also had the fried chicken...super good.  I knew I was going to dig the place whenI heard the atmospheric jazzy music coming from their reel to reel behind the front desk.
My Favorite Burger in the World!!!!!!! You got to get the Bacon it is so smokey.  I have never had bacon like this!!!! One tip you just need a single because it comes with two patties. It was so juicy and whatever sauce they put on this burger gives it that added flavor. The fries are so good you can just eat them up plain.  The ambiance is so hip and the music there is great it makes you want to stay there all night and they are open until like 1am. Great place to come to on a date or by yourself because it is like an way upscale cool diner where you can sit at the counter and watch them in the kitchen.  I dream about this place!!!
"I really don't see what all the fuss is about.  My family (2 adults and 3 teenagers) had dinner on Tuesday night.  They packed us into a booth because it didn't appear that there were any tables for more than 4.  We ordered drinks and the bone marrow to start, 4 burgers, regular fry, a fry with the egg and a chicken for dinner.  Was the bone marrow good? Sure.  Was it the best I have ever had? noWas it a good burger? yes.  Best? no and certainly not worth $10.  Or the $20 after you add bacon and egg.  The fried chicken was good but it was swimming in the sauce (which I suppose the wet towels were for).  I would have preferred to taste more of the chicken and simply not sauce.Worst of all we did not have very good service.  Our waitress seemed angry.  Don't know why and don't really care.  It seemed that her purpose was to get us in and out as fast as humanly possible.  So we never felt comfortable.  So after spending over $220 in under 40 minutes we barely felt like we experienced our visit.I probably won't return.  Maybe if I could sit at the bar and not feel so rushed I would give the restaurant more stars.  There are too many restaurants out there to try."
"My husband was about to travel to India for 2 weeks on business and I asked him where he wanted his last American meal.  Without hesitation, he said Au Cheval!  He is quite the burger man and needed to have the famed Au Cheval burger before departing the states.  The 2 of us walked into this super tiny place on a Friday night  at 610pm.  We were told it would be an hour wait.  OK.  I get it.  It's a Friday...I should chill and enjoy the great beer menu w/ my husband.  Well, 8:40 rolls around and we FINALLY get our table.  Yup, that's 2 hours and 30 minutes AFTER we arrived!  Mind you, at about the 90 minute mark we could've sat at the bar and had dinner but I claimed that  we were pot committed to having a table so we waited it out.  Needless to say, we were going to REALLY take our time and enjoy dinner.  I am a recent mammal eating convert and decided to try the marrow.  So delicious, so salty, so buttery, so tasty.  I felt very primal scooping it out of the bone.  I had the chicken wings for my entree and they were wonderful.  Fat, juicy, spicy, and delicious.  My husband had the burger and I had a few bites.  Now I know what I've been missing all these years of non-mammal eating!  He ranked it up there w/ a burger from Kuma's.  The only way I would go back, however, is if the wait is short.  I stuck it out for the first trip but would probably be a bit crabby second time around."
"Only three stars for the best cheeseburger in Chicago?  Though we waited an hour and a half for a table, my party agreed that the food is out of this world: burgers and fries that you will remember long after the meal ends.  But the service was a 1 star.  As other Yelpers have said, there is something off about the waitress--she was arrogant and rude.   We were actually afraid to ask her questions and we weren't alone--those around us had the same experience.  You go back to a restaurant when you have a good experience.  The service would definitely make us think twice.  With lines out the door, they probably don't worry about my business, but I'm not sure what the owner/manager is thinking on this one."
"I really loved this place! Absolutely amazing! Started off with their fantastic bloody mary. Absolutely delicious with all the peppers they served and it was a great portion. Then I just decided on the single cheeseburger. Holy cow! As a single, it was huge with the 2 thick slices of bacon and an egg on top. OH!!! Soooo savory! Can't stop thinking about it. My friends decided to share the 32 oz pork porterhouse which was also amazing. They only make one a day and we were lucky enough that no one had ordered it yet. The wait was definitely worth it. The atmosphere was perfect and the service was great! Definitely coming back!"
"You pretty much can't go wrong here. I have eaten lunch here a lot and I've had about everything on the menu. Great burgers, definitely the best of the thin-patty genre. The beer list is really good and the staff is on top of everything. Love their take on General Tso's chicken. The only thing I haven't tried is the baloney sandwich.This place has become very popular so don't be surprised if you have to wait."
"There are so many things that I enjoy about this place.  I don't think I've seen any other place serve bone marrow the way this place does.  It's glitzy.  It's delicious.  It's enormous.  Marvelous stuff it is.I always want to order the monster pork chop but chicken out.  They do not have many of these however.  Last time I talked to one of the chefs, he mentioned that at most one or two a night are stocked and sometimes not at all, so call ahead if you've got your mind set on it.  That conversion was a while ago though, so YMMV.The general jane's chicken is pretty good.  The flavor profile is similar to lil hotties/popsicle chicken/kam pong gi but the chicken pieces are sized way up.  If you've ever wondered what it would be like to throw caution to the wind and pour out a couple jars of Great Seas sauce all over normal chicken pieces but shied away from actually doing it, well here's your alternative.The burger with bacon and fried egg is just crazy.  Definitely fits into my top five burger experiences.  Burgers are crazy subjective since there is so much going on, this one makes it work on a high level.  You get the thick cut salty smokey bacon doing the traditional magic with the fat from the egg yolk, but then brought together with a juicy ground beef patty with a handle made of egg washed flour bun.The Mille Feuille is a worthy dessert.  It looks monstrous, but that's because of how light and airy the entire dish is.  The balance of textures is my favorite part of this dish, though the flavor of the creme and puffed pastry are quite good.  Usually these things are pretty dang small, but here they went all McD's and supersized it in the best way possible.  Eating this thing can be a bit messy, but yeah it's worth the effort and calories.The bologna sandwich...  Yeah, it's pretty awesome.  Having said that, I think some have just never had a sandwich like this before and are just blown away.  It is good and if you've never had such a beast, yeah it's amazing.  But for those that have, you may say meh.  Personally, I'm a fan of fried mortadella sandwiches...  :)The draft beer menu is also quite good.  It is well edited and I believe changes up quite a bit.  They've got a little bit of everything from Bud on tap to the semi exotic stuff out of eastern europe.However...  And there is a however...  The place is so dang crowded now.  So have a plan B if the wait is excessive.  Wasn't always crowded like it is now, but oh well.The chiliquiles...  Why are they always served after midnight right?  I want me some chiliquiles!  They soooo good!  It's because they change the flavor of the oil a lot when they make em.  So, yeah, you gotta wait until they stop deep frying stuff for the day apparently.Oh, and yes, the music is playing off of that reel to reel."
"Knowing what you are getting into at this place will help you set reasonable expectations. Came here on a Friday night around 9:30pm, and the wait was about 90 minutes. We were prepared for this. Luckily, there was a bit of space for the three of us to stand and have drinks. The waitress took our drink orders as we stood around and drank, which was nice. By the time we sat, it was late, but we were prepared to have a later night out. Plus, I think the heavy food tastes better after 10pm :)Old Fashioned - Super Smoooooth. Fantastic!Vieux Bonal - A little more tart and blatantly alcoholic of a whisky based drink. Horse's Neck - Refreshing and bright - really good with the salty and rich foods they offerChicken Chopped Liver - My friend ordered this. It was good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it. Fried Chicken - SCRUMPTIOUS!Foie Gras and Scrambled Eggs - Really exquisite. I totally get what this dish is about, but I just didn't prefer it - I don't love foie gras apparently. But the scrambled eggs were done so well. Not overcooked. Cheeseburger - Can't go wrong with this. The bun is nice. Fries w Egg - The Fries were really good, I found the egg unnecessaryPickles - Get these to have something bright and crisp to cleanse your palatte from all the other heavy dishes"
Real good food Fries with truffle sauce are awesome Long wait ;)Worth trying
"Au. My. Gawd.  Sorry, had to be done.Honestly, there's not much to add to the reviews here.  What am I going to say about the fried bologna sandwich that hasn't been said?  Perhaps make up a word?  Okay, that sandwich was scrumptiliousastical. That will have to do since trying to transcribe my low moaning noises while eating it would probably be NSFW.The burger is everything all the hype says it is.  EVERYTHING.  ALL THE THINGS. The chopped liver is salty and rich and comes with insanely good bread for shmearification.  Daiquiri was almost as good as the one at Billy Sunday, which is now my measuring stick for daiquiris.  Quit reading and go eat a bologna sandwich ya rummies."
"Upscale diner is the best way to describe this place. When you walk in, it's dark, intimate, with an old fashioned feeling of bar counter tops and booth seating. One of the first things you'll notice is the number of taps they offer in this small and intimate diner. The open kitchen is mesmerizing as you watch them prepare mouth-watering dish after mouth-watering dish. Not only do they provide an extensive list of beer on tap, they also create handcrafted cocktails as well. Since this space is so small, be prepared to wait during peak hours. I've heard wait times can be up to 2 hours on a Friday/Saturday night."
Amazing food sweet atmosphere. Then I went back a second time to show my fiancé and the bitch at the front said there was a two hour wait with empty tables. Most likely won't be back. Too bad with such good food that bad service could kill a rep.
"Had a short wait, but got a seat at the counter.  Great to watch how all the food is prepared. The potato hash with duck heart gravy and a fried egg is to die for, but is probably not the healthiest option"
"Try one of the best beers ever, the Rodenbach Grand Cru!It is a sour and I love it. If that's not your thing, their beer selection is impressive and you'll find something you like. That said, as a vegetarian, there are nothing other than fries and salad. I was disappointed looking at the menu... This place is a meat-lover's haven!"
"One of the best burgers I've ever had, top 3 lifetime. You have to get it ""au cheval"" style with a fried egg and bacon (which was more like pork belly). Great fries and aioli as a side. Tons of good beers on tap. And they have a ""Dr. Devon's Pickleback"" on their menu, I'm sold!They don't take reservations, and the wait can get quite long. But they'll take your phone number and text you when a table is ready. You can also wait by the bar and try to get one of the first come, first serve seats there."
"Au Cheval's burgers are really delicious!  I got the double burger with a fried egg and it was so good!  The burgers here are on a totally different level compared to other restaurant burgers.My buddy got their bologna sandwich and their hash browns and I heard those were really good too.The ambience of the restaurant is nice.  It's dimly lit like most bars but it has a good setup that makes the place feel relatively ""open"" even though it's not a very big restaurant.The waitress was really nice and very helpful in terms of providing good recommendations.The beer selection is pretty great.  As someone who likes craft beers, I really liked their selection of craft beers.One note is that a ""45 minute to 1 hour wait"" is realistically a 20-30 minute wait.I agree with another review here in which the price for dinner here can be fairly inexpensive if you get a burger to quite expensive if you get something nicer.Overall, great experience and I would definitely go again!"
"4 stars only for the food and the waitress we had. The hostess that night was just horrible and was on her phone all night. So my bf and I came here one friday night and it was packed! hostess told us it was about an hour and 15 mins wait (usually they over estimate) but ended up waiting over 2 hours! which was pretty irritating since she told us they were going to seat us next at the 1 hour and 30 minute mark,. Well... based on the reviews I saw, we ordered the foi gras, bone marrow, and a cheese burger. the foi gras complimented the side of  toast really well. Bone marrow in my opinion was a bit too salty. Cheeseburger was cooked perfectly and was delicious!"
"Perhaps my experience at Au Cheval was complimented by the good company I was with - friends who were as excited to try this place as much as I did - because I have to say that our dining experience there was a hit! Quite extraordinary!Yes, yes..the wait was an hour and a half and we were very impatient all 90 minutes of it, but it was so worth the wait! Besides, because they text or call you when you're table is ready we were able to wait at Haymarket so it wasn't too terrible.For the most part we ordered to share with the table. We got the bone marrow (served with toast and beef cheek marmalade), General Jane's chicken, 2 orders of burger topped with bacon and egg (this is the only thing I didn't try), fries with garlic aioli, and their hash browns. All this food plus my friends got a root beer and a cocktail (a daiquiri, I think) and our bill was about $100 (before tip)..not too shabby!Everything was delicious...the bone marrow with the marmalade was sinful! The chicken was savory-goodness (this description doesn't really explain how good the chicken was - you just have to taste it for yourself), the fries was as to be expected but the aioli was heaven, and the hash browns were excellent - great pairing for the chicken. Unfortunately, I didn't try the burgers but my friends enjoyed it very much.The atmosphere there was loud, dark, and hipster..but it was friendly, happy, and social. I would definitely go back again and maybe try their brunch menu. What a wonderful place with tremendous food and the price was reasonable for the type of restaurant they are and crowd they cater to."
"There are so many brunch places in the city and everyone seems to have their favorite. I'll be honest - brunch is not one of my go-to eating out meals. I enjoy a good brunch but I don't crave going out for food on a nice sunday morning for some reason. Anyway, Au Cheval is such a fun place and has awesome and decadent food that when they started serving brunch a few weeks ago I had to check it out.If you've been to the diner before than you know you shouldn't consult your doctor or get a cholesterol test shortly after. The food is awesome but extremely meat focused with no shortage of eggs, duck heart gravy, foie gras, etc to add. (Don't miss the burger either: Bon Appetit likes it.) The good news is that brunch is no different, just with a few different menu options. It's has standard breakfast items that mostly focus on the eggs already on the regular menu. I don't remember seeing pancakes and waffles, but that could easily have been an oversight. One item in particular that is not on the dinner menu is Jane's Muffin. Unbelievable  Try it. Love it. Order four.We ordered a lot. More than we could ever dream of eating but we didn't tell that to our stomachs. It might be the first meal in years where I wanted to continue eating but literally could not physically do it. The richness of the food is a bit overwhelming, but that's the point of the place - so it's not a knock on them. I went with the traditional breakfast (eggs, toast, bacon), but we also had an order of hash browns, a side of bacon (totally unnecessary but too good to miss), and an omelette. Everything rocked, just didn't have enough room in the belly to finish everything. I love the thick cut bacon but I think it's a little tastier at sister spot Bavette's. Hash browns with carmalized onions awesome and I really like the eggs - but I didn't understand giving me four huge slices of buttered toast, almost texas toast style. I think some wheat bread with jelly would be prefect. Don't forget the drinks either! Nice bloody and a good selection of other morning cocktails. It's an awesome time both for dinner and brunch, just know what you're getting into. Great rich, heavy, delicious food."
"I don't know if something is wrong with me, but the burger I had was downright awful.  Gave it a second shot, same thing.  I feel like I'm missing something whenever I hear someone rave about it.  Must not be for me.Service was fantastic, but then again both times I've gone were with one of their employees.Drinks I've had have all been delicious.  They're doing something right on that end.Other food I've had was great.  The friend chicken and pork porterhouse were both delicious. I'll probably have to return to try some of their other stuff."
Hand down my favorite place in Chicago!  Dont mess around.... Go straight for the burger and fries.
BEST. BURGER. EVER.Single (double) cheeseburger + Fries with mornay & garlic aoli + Emelisse Espresso Stout + perfect atmosphere + good music (Twin Shadow) = Big old koolaid grin from ear to ear :)
"We couldn't take a seat until the entire parties show up, which was fine. We couldn't even preorderd, which happened to be fine as well because the food came out pretty quick even though the place was packed.Cheeseburger with bacon and raw vegetable salad was the best among the dishes we ordered. Crispy fries and bologna burger was too salty that even gave me headache!! Overall, very salty."
"This place is the bomb -- best for late night eats. The music is always good, albeit unpredictable. (The other night it was Phil Collins and Foreigner). The staff is laid-back and cool. Great service other than the one time when my boyfriend's dirty martini arrived garnished with a cherry (they remade it for him).The burger is everything the hype says it is -- it tastes like a fast-food burger and I mean that as a compliment. It tastes like it's been on a grill where things like bacon and eggs and onions have been fried. It tastes like the best dirty grease has gone into it. I know that sounds wrong/disgusting, but you have to try to see what I mean.Also love the chicken wings -- messy, but awesome. A little spicy and a little sweet. The smashed potatoes are among the best I've ever had. The chicken livers are great. The pickles are addictive. The bacon and egg chopped salad is amazing. Even the lame-sounding plain ol' mixed green salad is delicious. Nothing I've ever at this place has been bad or even mediocre. I haven't tried the root beer float, but my roommate swears by it.Just go."
"Expect to wait, get bumped into, and observe many hipsters. And if you hate the fake moustache trend that's going on right now, you may run into some problems at Au Cheval. I've been here twice-- once for a drink at the bar and last night for dinner. Sitting at the bar allows you to see the chefs at work and is really entertaining, but it does get a little warm. For dinner, I walked in at 7 pm and was seated by about 8. Their extensive drink menu definitely helped to pass the time. Don't underestimate the girly daiquiri, it's strong! The bone marrow with toast was delicious. It is a bit sweet, but I was expecting that from the marmalade description. General Jane's Fried Chicken was perfect in every way-- super juicy, big pieces of chicken smothered in tangy Asian flavors. They serve two warm towels with the chicken and they definitely came in handy. Since they don't have a dessert menu, the waiter just rattled the options off to us. We went with his recommendation, which was layers of cream between puff pastry. That was probably my least favorite dish of the night. It was fine, but had less of a wow factor than the marrow and chicken."
"Went on a Saturday afternoon a little after 1 for brunch.  Food was so rich and decadent and probably the best brunch food I've had in a long time.I had the foie and eggs, which were outstanding, so creamy and sinful.  Had fries on the side, and sampled my friend's super crispy hash browns.  My other friend had the cheeseburger, which was as tasty as expected.  One of the best burgers, hands down and rightly earns the title from Bon Apetit.The mille feuile for dessert continued the decadent trend and was a sweetly devilish ending.Friendly and attentive service, laid back and easy."
"Excellent service and food.chicken liver - amazing, probably best I ever hadbleu cheese omelet - silky, smooth and very tastycheeseburger - lives up to the hypehorse neck - refreshing and a nice mix of citrusI will definitely be back here again for lunch or try it for dinner.  Everyone was friendly."
"Wow.  Long wait, but appreciate the text table readiness awareness.  Simple and often under utilized.  Burgers are delicious and the fries are dangerously good!  Beer selection remains solid and the staff is strong. Highly recommend."
"Even more epic when you're sober...ish.  Burger amazing, fries great with the aioli, and a bloody mary that makes you scream ""I'm full and I have no room for a burger"", just kidding because I always have room for that bacon burger with an egg on top!"
"Saw this place on some Food network show listed as the ""best burger in Chicago"".Completely lives up to its name.  Best burger I've ever had in my life.  Literally stop reading this and go eat one of their burgers.Our server (who was super cool) recommended the bacon as a side, which I was not a fan of.  It was super sweet and was cut as thick as ham."
"I'm just going to put this out there:  this is totally NOT my kind of food.  That doesn't mean, however, that it's not very well done for the type of food that it is.  And it is... very well done.So here's the scoop:  Super French, super heavy, super rich, super pork-y.  And there are plenty of people out there that LOVE this kind of food.  If you're one of them, you must hit up Au Cheval in the West Loop.Roasted bone marrow with an onion jam and toast.  It's like butter and jam on toast except it's meat butter and uber sweet onion jam.  There's not enough parsley salad on the earth to cut the richness of this dish.  For me, it was fabulous for 2 bites.Go figure... Griddled Brat with smashed potatoes and roasted garlic gravy.  Again, super rich but beautiful.And here's the grand daddy of 'em all:  Foie gras and pork stuffed cabbage.  It's essentially a sausage  and foie pie with a thin cabbage crust.  Holy fatty meat, batman.So there you have it.  If you're into heavy French comfort food, it's a must.  Otherwise, stay far, far away.(Oh... PS.  I've heard the burger is AMAZING!)"
"My friend and I were the picture of a modern day Norman Rockwell - seated at the bar, sipping our rootbeer float made with Black Dog Gelato's malted vanilla ice cream from two straws.  I couldn't help but feel 16 again...16 and incredibly hip.I love Au Cheval.  From their throw back booths, to their upscale diner nosh (can upscale and diner go hand in hand?).  And though the wait can at times be frustrating, they seem to have a nice set up with a server specifically utilized to take drink orders from waiting patrons.  And they serve up a well rounded menu of craft beers.  We were told the wait would be two hours, but were seated within the hour when a host pulled us from the waiting crowd to see if we'd be willing to take two seats that just opened up at the bar.  We obliged happily and were eating twenty minutes later.We let our server decide our order, however I made one request for something somewhat healthy in an otherwise glutenous menu.  What resulted was a hamburger, raw veggie salad, and what I believe was the smoked salmon plate.  All were exceptional.  On a previous visit I also split the sausage and mashed potatoes with a friend as a little late night nosh (right after eating sausage and lentils at Maude's an hour prior) and wowza.   I guess I'm just a two sausage/one night kind of gal.  No dirty jokes please.Oh, and that root beer float that opened this review wide open?  That malted vanilla ice cream was something out of dream.  Root beer floats used to be my jam back in the day and I'm just going to go bold and say it - this was the best root beer float I've ever had.  Period.A great recommendation to anyone looking for a casual/cool atmosphere on Randolph."
"This is my happy place. I've been here 12 times and ordered the burger every single time. Anyone who doesn't think they have the best burger in Chicago is lying to you. There is no way a burger that simple should be that delicious but it is. Plus, add in the amazing craft beer they have on top, the service which makes you feel welcome all the time, and the music and it's easy to see why this is one of the coolest places in the city."
"Food: 5/5. Service: 3/5. Fries mornay, fried egg, garlic aioli; fried bologna sandwich; bread & butter pickles. Not to be missed, the best of the Midwest.  I have thought about this meal many times since."
"Went there for Sat lunch because of recommendations from a few friends, and it recently being listed on MSN as the ""best burger in Illinois"".  To sum up the experience in one word...Meh.  The food wasn't bad, but it also wasn't the best I have eaten in Illinois, or Chicago for that matter.  If you like a more 'trendy' atmosphere, then this is the place for you, and I suspect a lot of the reviews are more about the atmosphere than the food itself.  As I said, it was good, but I thought a bit overpriced and over-hyped.  We didn't have to wait long.....20 mins in line, and the restaurant is nice, but they try to shuffle too many folks through in a fast fashion.  Hence, the food was all undercooked to our liking.  loud BOOMING music hits you when you enter the door, and mind you, I am no stranger to loud music, but when you have to yell to have a conversation at the same table, it is a bit too much.  The highlight was probably the bacon...it was great, but very fatty as a lot of bacon is.....and we were concerned because it looked a little undercooked, so we sent it back.  Fries were good....again not the best, and the ""famous"" burger was just not up to the standards I expected from the reviews.  I was expecting more beef, more evenly cooked, and although the sauce and toppings were OK, I really didn't need a full inch of whatever creamy artery clogging concoction that was which took over the whole flavor of the burger.  I can give you a whole list of other places to try that have better burgers, less wait, and better prices within just a few minutes of this place.  the best part of the morning was wandering down the block and waiting in The Little Goat bakery........."
"Pretty sure I heard like 3 Com Truise tunes here last night on the film reel while slowly melting the foie gras terrine in between two of my chins. It's just how I roll... get it? Chins? Roll? Fucking killing this review 2 sentences in. At any rate, Com+Foie = an instant cinco estrella (and if you're a pet, Bob Barker's gonna spay ya). Com's playing at North Coast this weekend, btw, which I don't have tix to, so if you do have tix and aren't using them, I'd kindly ask that you not be a dick and relinquish them to me. Thanks.Service, food, beer list, and Bow Truss coffee are consistently top notch. The cocktail list is limited, but fun and pertinent to the overall theme. The Strange Brew is a reasonably impressive beer cocktail, apparently nicked from a bar in Milwaukee or Rockford or New York or some other city that wishes it were Chicago. Lacking ingredients to replicate this evening, I believe I just did pretty good at home with pale ale, lime, pisco, and gosling's ginger, but I'm highly futuristic. They also carry a Pegu Club as one of their signature drinks. It's one of those classic cocktails that was brought back long enough ago that it's almost retro at this point, like Classic Coke. Do you really want to want to live in a world without Coca-Cola? Heisenberg doesn't. Alright, so this review didn't finish as strong as it started. Back up off my shit. I had a long day and my taint is about to ferment from this humidity. If you don't know, now you know. Bell Biv Devoe."
"I came here for my birthday and had an awesome time. Amazing burgers, and great cocktails!"
"I love Au Cheval.  It is my favorite casual restaurant in the city, always a good experience.The place/ambiance/noise.  This place is small and it gets loud so definitely don't go looking to catch up over a quiet dinner.  The wait can get extremely long, over 2 hours and they do not take reservations, however you can plan ahead and find a good local bar.  They will take your number and text you when your table is up. Their bar is also top notch, especially for beer fans so if they are under capacity and you don't mind a crowd you can squeeze in and enjoy a drink while you wait.The staff is always helpful, friendly, and accommodating.  They know the menu well and the beer menu well and are always willing to give input or suggestions.  The food is top notch.  They do kind of an upscale version of diner fare.  The fried bologna sandwich is great, the burger is my favorite in the city, and the scrambled eggs with foie gras is so good.  Their bacon is about half an inch thick and very tasty.They are open now for lunch (at least on Fridays) and getting there early to sit at the counter usually gets you a seat if you are alone or with one person."
"Besides having the best burger in the city. Kira, the hostess is an angel. I felt like I should have given her a hug when I left"
"I'm basing my review solely on the omelette I had, which was just incredible - like no omelette I've tried before. I saw Jaques Pepin on his TV show once showing the traditional, 'authentic' way to make a French omelette and this was exactly how the chef was doing it from what I could see from along the bar. I've really gotta go back and try one of those burgers now."
"We came here for the burger with the instructions that it was one of the best burgers in the city, and we were not let down. And the mashed potatoes.... wow.We were hungry when we arrived, but still we had extremely high expectations, and were not let down.It's a thin patty burger, so don't expect a thick juicy mid-rare burger. The fries were good. Not amazing but good.We will definitely come back for another try and take a stab at more of the side dishes, I'm thinking they are all probably amazing from the looks of them."
"My wife, grandson, and I had lunch at Au Cheval and the hamburger was among the best I've ever had. It was cooked perfectly and the sauce definitely made it near perfect. Even the 11 year old was enthusiastic. My wife loved the raw veggie salad. I'll definitely be back."
"The buzz around that burger is just.... so right. So very right. Make sure you get it ""au cheval"" style, with the fat slices of bacon and a fried egg. I mean you can get it regular, but unless you're planning to wait at least another 30-45 minutes in the foreseeable future (on a Wednesday night what?!), you're only there once. The soundtrack is killer both in terms of quality and volume, so keep that in mind."
"Ok, these 5 stars go directly to that burger ... that delicious, balanced piece of work. Really ... I am not trying to exaggerate and honestly, the taste could come across as particular, which might not entice everyone (it has an overall tangy salted flavor) but let me say this... from beginning to end, I am happy, satisfied and slightly aroused (yes, a good pieces of meat can do that to you.This burger works on flavor and texture ... first, the bun, it looks like a brioche with that glistening slightly browned look, it hold the patties together, no problem. Then, inside... I don't get it with egg and bacon, you really don't need it, I just get everything else... yellow american cheese (normally this is not ok, but here is works more towards the texture than anything else), a dijonaise sauce (there you have your tangy and extra layer of creamy) and pickles...salty goodness. I feel like there is a dash of sweetness, but I am forgetting now. Also, what I like is that they don't ask you how you want it cooked... thank you!! You do not have to when it's that good...and no worries, it is cooked just right... medium rare (hinting towards medium than rare). PS, I am sure the other food is great as well, but at those prices, I'll just stick to that glorious ""single"" patty burger. Don't be a fool and get the double, too much of a good thing sometimes is too much."
"Cozy sheik, friendly waitstaff, delicious brunch- what more could you ask for on a cold Sunday afternoon? The fried baloney sandwich was orgasmic and the bloody marys came to our table featuring a mini garden of pickles and leafy celery tops- they were perfectly spiced. I cant wait to come back for dinner."
"I wish I had this bar in Portland because I would definately be a regular!  It has a great atmosphere, cozy booths, friendly staff, delicious cocktails and upscale bar food."
So yummy!  Best food and the burgers and fries are to die for.  I also tried the chili with the hunk of corn bread and brat with smashed potatoes.  Everything is so good!! Get the egg on top of burger and fries!!!
"Au Cheval, you remind me so much of Maude's, except that unless I come armed with Lipitor, you will probably give me a heart attack.  (I'm not sure if it's the sight of 30+ beers on tap - Belgian, German, and American craft beer - or the beyond-rich food that will induce said heart attack.)The restaurant pays homage to the greasy spoon diner that it emulates.  Tiled floors, those chrome bar chairs, and cushioned booths are combined with a wooden bar and tables, dim lighting, and exposed brick walls to create a much more mysterious atmosphere. [1]After reviewing both the beers available for the evening and the cocktail options, I chose a Pegu Club.  (Because I was going to be eating a very heavy dinner, I needed something lighter than an IPA.)  The cocktail was refreshing and citrusy, so much that a second round was in order for the evening.For dinner, I ordered a single cheeseburger (which is actually more like a double and yes, there is a double on the menu) with a fried egg on top.  I typically despise burgers, but this was a definite improvement from any sort of burger joint/ diner burger.  Everything from the bread to how the meat was marinated made it feel like a legitimate entree.  We also shared an order of fries, which came with a delicious aioli dipping sauce.As soon as everything is done coagulating in my arteries, I will certainly be back for a beer.[1] +1 for the indie music selection as well."
"Very cool atmosphere - diner car, hip music playing off the reel-to-reel, bottles of water in an ice bucket reminiscent of a bbq joint - we were welcomed and seated quickly, but we beat the lunch crowd.Bone marrow appetizer was quite tasty.  Having read about their famous burgers, ordered a burger with fried egg.  Butter pickles were amazing.  It was truly wonderful, can't give a greater compliment than it put me in a food coma for a couple hours afterwards.  The root beer was also great.  Burger cooked perfectly."
Home of the single greatest burger on planet Earth. nuff said.
"Shabby chic with a liberal dash of charisma...this is how I would describe Au Cheval.  When my business lunch afforded me the opportunity to choose the destination....I instantly thought of Au Cheval (as the attendees were foodies and I have had good luck with great restaurants like GT Fish/Oyster for lunch because it is easier to score a table).  I arrived early...and had a chance to hob knob with the hostess who provided the following words of wisdom on what to order.  ""If you dont get the burger, you will be beaten about the face and neck""Having grown fond of my nose over the past few decades...we took our tour guides advice.  How did this story end you ask?  Everyone was lobbing bouquets of praise at the chef....the burger was so good (classic prep with egg and bacon)...we barely touched our AMAZING fries (with garlic aioli and fried egg).  I can say with confidence .... if a better burger exists within our amazing city....PLEASE SHOW IT TO ME.  Not only is it a treat for your tastebuds...but it is the SEKSIEST sandwich you will ever wrap your hands around.  Extra points for the analog sound system with wood wrapped REEL TO REEL tape deck spinning a great downtempo soundtrack.  Warm, urban vibe....that begs you to stay and have another beer.  We did just that...."
"I had the honey fried chicken with the asian sauce (on the side - can't take much hot spice). It was terrific! We shared the fries with mornay sauce, egg and garlic aioli.  Another person had a burger with egg and bacon which was damn yummy!!!  Will be back to try more dishes. Be warned everything is ala carte, so can add up.  Small place and most times there is a wait. But worth it. Good list of beers. Great service and love the dark kinda of quaint atmosphere."
People that work there are great. The setting is warm and comfortable. Food was so good. Make sure someone orders the chicken. Enough said. It is my new favorite place to go.
I am one of the believers thst this place has a top burger.  You have to get the bacon and egg! The high price and long wait made me drop a star because there are great places to eat on Randolph with less of a wait.
Best burger!!!  You don't need the egg on top.  Melts in your mouth.  Try the chicken wings.  Spicy and crispy.  I can't wait to go back.
"Best burger? I don't think so. But it is a good burger. It's moist and has the components that make it good. However, it ends at good. I think there are burgers that have more flavor that I would constitute is great. Also had the General Jane's chicken. It was so sweet and salty. Asian's make those chicken wings and they make it far better. They also leave the wing tip, which I think should always be taken off before cooking/serving. I mean do you ever see a wing joint serve the entire wing with the tip? C'mon!The bone marrow is becoming very popular wherever you go. Theirs is no different. It costs more here, but they also give you a lot more. They serve it with a marmalade on the side, which is very good.I would go back, but I wouldn't rave about their food. It is a bit pricey considering its a burger and chicken but they make up for it with good beer."
"How rich can you take it? Because the foie gras and bone marrow are both fab. Add some fried chicken, a double cheeseburger with a side of cheese drenched fries, and you'll die happy. Great service, tasty beverages, and the reel-to-reel tunes are what will have me coming back on the regular tip. Not too pricey, but it should be knownthat most things on the menu are smaller and for sharing. Think Gastro-Tapas. Oh yea, the deserts were out of this world and employ local legend Black Dog Gelato."
"I make sure to stop here when I'm in Chicago.  I could not say enough about how great this place is.  They have a great beer selection, the best music I've heard in a restaurant, and the best hamburgers."
"The best burger in Chicago. Perfectly cooked, juicy, cheesy, saucy, with a bun that doesn't overwhelm. Pairs perfectly with a sharable serving of fries, topped with a sunny side up egg.I sat at the bar once and was able to observe the cooking / preparing process. All the dishes looked amazing, but I haven't yet been able to bring myself to order anything other than the burger. I've had it with the egg and bacon option, but don't feel it's necessary. I'm also not a huge bacon fan, so I'm sure others would disagree.Great beer and drink list, too. The bloody mary looks like a salad in a glass. Yum!"
The best burger I've ever had! Great ambiance and awesome music selections. Great date spot.
"So in love with this place, not in love with the no reservation policy. We walked in on Tuesday night and there was quite a line at the door but they were all waiting for a table, we were able to sit at two end seats at the bar which were actually pretty good seats. We could see how the food was being prepared and all the people sitting in booths along the wall. It's cool and dark in here, like a lot of the newer spots in town. They have quite a few beers to choose from as well as some cocktails but we stuck with two delicious beers that we had never heard of. My bf ordered a griddled brautwurst and I ordered the fried bologna sandwich (because it was rated one of the best sandwiches in Chicago!) along with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. Yeah, the sandwich lived up expectations. It practically melted in my mouth. I ordered it Au Cheval style, which means with a fried egg on top. I do not regret my decision for a minute. It was delicious. My bf enjoyed his dish as well and ended up eating half of mine. For dessert, they serve Black Dog Gelato and the portion was generous to say the least. Our server was kind of all over the place, but the joint was packed. The cooks were hillarious, and talked to us throughout our meal. The menu is kind of all over the place though and not in a good way in my opinion. Nothing was really organized and it didn't make much sense but that didn't stop me from enjoying myself."
"I went to Au Chavel on a cold Tuesday night at 6pm.  I figured that since they didn't take reservations that I would get in early to beat the crowd.  I didn't.  People were squished in against the door.   The wait was 45 minutes.  The host graciously offered to text me when the table was ready if we wanted to grab a drink across the street.  Long story short, 45 minutes turned into an hour and a half.  Then we were sat and ate amazing chicken wings.  There were full sized drum sticks and nice big wings.  Excellent.  The burger was on a pretzel bun and was good.  I opted for the bacon and an egg on top so the burger was around $15.  A basket of fries (comes with an egg on top) was $9 and was a standard basket of fries.   The whole dinner was a little over an hour.  The burger was great.  The best in the city?  No.  The entire experience took three hours, which is a long time for a $25 burger and fries, even if it is an great burger.  Therefore my judgement is 3 stars.  May God have mercy on their souls."
"I woke up this morning craving the egg foie gras I had last night at Au Cheval.  That is the true indicator that the food was a solid five. My friend and I had drinks at The Aviary earlier and after rounds of delicious drinks, we just wanted substantial food.  Our waitress recommended Au Cheval.  We walked right on over and were able to score seats at the bar. First of all, this place has a very cool French vibe. They play really cool music, have a great ambiance and are not pretentious. We started off with a couple of cocktails (very innovative drinks), and they were very solid.  It did take a while to get the bartenders attention, but she was lovely once she started talking to us.  On her recommendation we got the foie gras and the fried chicken. OMG....they were both amazing. The foie gras and eggs is very rich and is served with tasty bread. I wanted to bathe in it!  The fried chicken was cooked to perfection and had the best sweet tangy sauce.  The place got really bumping by the time we left (1AM).  This is definitely a place I would go back to."
"The burger absolutely lives up to the hype.  Is it worth waiting for, YES.  Service is top notch.  Menu is not overwhelming but offers a good range of options.  I want to try the bone marrow.  White fish (salmon when I tried it) was seasoned/prepared perfectly.  Great atmosphere, almost entertaining as all the food is cooked in the bar area.  I like when I can see my food getting cooked.  Specialty cocktails are worth a try.  I have been going back pretty much every 4-5 days with a friend in tow to share the experience.  Brandan Sodikoff nailed it w this one!"
"We went here with a group of four as you can share many of the entrees. The best meal I've had in a long, long time. The burger was perfectly cooked with super thin pickles, and the single burger was a DOUBLE!  The fries with garlic aioli were out of this world, I highly recommend you try them. Delicious, strong drinks and whoever is in charge of the music selection knows what's up. 5 stars all the way."
"Went for lunch with coworkers, had an incredible time. The atmosphere was phenomenal and the food was even better. I have never had anything like the ham and cheese open toast fondue, highly recommended. Would definitely go back."
"Contemporary American diner fare is a new concept to me, but one that I can now wholeheartedly embrace. In what can only be described as an upscale vintage casual atmosphere (That's the only way to describe it. There are no other ways), diners are treated to Beef Stew with Marrow Bones & Bread; Fried House-made Bologna Sandwiches; and Foie Gras, Scrambled Eggs & Toast. Not for the squeamish, perhaps, but you're not cool if you don't eat those things.I didn't eat those things. I had the Griddled Bratwurst with smashed potatoes & roasted garlic gravy, and it was perfect, if small. The sausage was savory and flavorful and lacked any trace of uncomfortable fat or gristle, and it was topped with these soft garlic cloves that were just so good. On the other hand, while the General Tso's Fried Chicken with dried chili & brown sugar glaze was good, the too-subtle chili flavors were overwhelmed by the sweetness making it something of a one-note dish.Make note of their classic cocktail list; it includes the Pegu Club which is included in ""Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails"" by Ted Haigh, and incidentally that was the best birthday gift anyone's ever given me. The drink was powerful, mildly citrusy and the perfect antidote for a hot day in the jungle. Delicious, yet miles away from the typical modern girlie drink.Also, Au Cheval means horse according to Google Translate because why not."
"Awesome burger. The wait staff was pretty friendly. We went on a Saturday and were told it would be 2-2 1/2 hour wait, so we went across the street to Haymarket for beer, we ended up getting a table at Au Cheval after about an hour. You must get bacon on your burger. Enjoy!"
"Went here last night with three other people around 6 pm and got seated quickly however the restaurant was already full at this time, they do not take reservations.   Overall we were really happy with the food. We ordered matzo ball soup, which was a huge portion, the fries with mornay sauce, some single cheeseburgers, which like other reviews said comes with two patties, it also comes with pickles and a sauce on it so if you want your burger plain you need to request that, and the bratwurst and potatoes. I was not blown away by the burger, but maybe I was too hyped up after reading some reviews, it was definitely a good burger though. Great beer selection, cozy atmosphere, and generally good wait staff.....generally. Our waitress on the other hand was quite rude. For some reason she did not like our table, she often passed us up while going to check on other tables without a glance in our direction and when we asked to split our check with TWO cards she ROLLED HER EYES...literally rolled her eyes. I had no idea splitting your card between two people was a horrible offense. I wouldn't say it ruined our experience but it put a damper on it. I would go back for sure but pray we didn't get seated in her section."
"I've been here several times and the food is always excellent.  I can't say much that hasn't been said. Burgers, Fries, EVERYTHING AMAZING! ----- EXCEPT for the service.   5 stars on the food, 2 on the service.Last night takes the cake, our party was treated like garbage.  Our server was robotic and insincere (She's been my server before and each time my group feels the same).  I'll spare the details but the one that sticks in my head most goes as follows (this one happened in December):4 of us went for brunch craving good eats but more so some hangover curing Bloody Marys so we specifically sought out Au Cheval.Instant seating - good.  Before even looking at the menu we order 3 Bloodies and 1 Beer.  aprox 10 minutes later we put in the order for food and still no drinks at our table.  Several minutes go by, surprised the server hasn't noticed  we politely let he know.  Ok.. no problem, we don't mind so far.  Food's out and now we are eating... still no drinks.  She still doesn't notice.. (PS it daylight out and the restaurant is not busy at all). At this point we have forgotten about the drinks.. 3/4 into our meal i remember and  wave her down and remind her AGAIN. She is somehow apologetic and says.. ""Sorry about that, I'll go ahead and take care of the first one for you"" -- sounds good! First round? We might stay for 2!! She comes back.. finally.. drinks in hand (our plates have already been cleared mind you).  Half way thru our drinks and she drops off the bill.  No question about a second round or coffee or even a hint at desert.  We look at the bill.. she's comped.... DRUM ROLL... the BEER!!! LOL!!! the cheapest drink of all... a five dollar Beer.  The second problem I have with that comp is I'm the only guy at the table, that was my beer.  At least comp one of the ladies' drinks not the only guy at the table.    Ideally the entire round should have been comped..  Had she not given us the misleading impression of the comp to begin with we would have canceled the drink order all together.  Why would we want our bloodies after our meal when we ordered them prior?  Again, the food is phenomenal, the service not so much.   5 for 5 on  bad service. I'm pretty sure  I'll be back for food, but I'll just sit at the bar.PS. The Hostess' are always nice and accomodating"
"I had a lot of friends eat here recently and tell me the burger was the best they ever had or close to that.  So my expectations were pretty high.  I came early for lunch so had no issue getting a seat. Unfortunately the service was spotty throughout the meal.  The burger was good, even great but definitely not near the best one I've had.  And while the fries and hash browns were good, I've had better.  Overall a good experience but I think a little too hyped up and I think other places like DMK are a better bet both for burgers and fries.  Would pass on the hype and go elsewhere."
"One of the best meals I've ever had.  The wait was 2 hours for my party of 3 and we didn't eat until 9:45/10ish which is late for me.. I don't like to eat late but even after all that, it was still worth it.  The place is pretty small which explains the wait. I counted but I don't remember exactly.. looks like it seats 50? The wait time they quoted us was accurate so we just went down the street to a bar for some drinks. It was too crowded to wait inside.  My friends and I all ordered the same thing: the cheeseburger with bacon and we got two sides of crispy fries with mornay sauce, garlic aoili and the fried egg. They were all incredible.  The waiter warned us that two sides of fries might be a bit much and he was sort of right lol but I'm not sure if one would have been enough.  The burger was just heavenly and I only ate half of it. I brought the rest home for leftovers and while I'm not a huge fan of leftover burgers, it was just as good the next day.  I plan to come back except I'm hoping to pick a down time like middle of the afternoon during a weekday that I'm off work. Next time, I think I'll also get the thick cut peppered bacon. The bacon on my burger was amazing and I saw someone else had the side of bacon and it looked just as good."
"Absolutely delightful, from beginning to end. Note: their bar area is considered part of their dining room, assigned seating and all."
Best burger I have had (and I have had them all over).  Had the single burger with bacon and egg.  Outstanding taste.  Definitely hipster vibe but I got great service at the counter.  A waiter saw me standing at the bar and found me a great local beer selection.
"Until I had visited Au Cheval my favorite burger in Chicago was at Kuma's. Now, I'd have to say the burger at Au Cheval beats Kuma's. I got the cheeseburger with bacon (definitely considering adding it!) and it was mouth-watering good. Service was equally as good. We were seated at the bar and were in and out within 30 minutes (we told our waitress we were in a hurry).The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the wait. We were told it would be 30 minutes or sooner and we ended up waiting about an hour (went around 11am on a Saturday). Not a huge deal but even after waiting we were seated at the bar.Overall, definitely recommend making a visit here for their burger... even if you have to wait, it will be worth it!"
"The burger is made out of wishes and dreams. You can expect to wait at least an hour more on the weekends, but it is worth the wait. You don't come to this place for the drinks; overpriced and not that great. The bologna sandwich will blow your mind."
"As I write this review, I'm a bit disappointed that they don't have a menu up on their website.  Their menu is a bit eclectic than what you would normally find on a typical diner.  For you New Yorkers, it's a type of a restaurant that you would normally find in the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn.I wish yelp did half stars.  I would give this place more of a 3.5 stars than 3.  The service was great and the food was delicious as well, but I think I expected something a lot better after reading all the yelp reviews.  I had the fried chicken which is a must have.  Consisting of mostly dark meat, it's crispy, moist, sweet, with just the perfect amount of spice.  The husband had the marrow, which was delicious but wasn't ""oh my gosh, I'm in love with this"" type of good.   The fries came with a fried egg and two different sauces.  I have mixed feelings about this.  The fries were good but then I feel that there's something so good about a classic french fry that maybe you just shouldn't mess with it.  Overall, I loved the open kitchen, and the large number of different type of beers to quench your thirst.  I would definitely go back again on my next visit."
I ordered the crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy...one bite and I fell in love. First of all the place is small but so comfy and I loved the decor. Not pretentious at all. I had a hard time finding a cocktail off the drink list because I usually drink vodka but whatever the server recommended worked for me! Definitely going back and a great place to go with a small group of friends.
Amazing place.. I would describe it as French style comfort food. With a European Gastro pub type atmosphere. I ordered the bratwurst over smashed potatoes and the chopped salad. This salad was more bacon and egg and by bacon I mean like sick pork belly type bacon. With a nice peppered texture.  With a house made ranch. It was unbelievable. Perfect for a cold night after a long day of work. Andrea was a super friendly server and made the whole experience just over-the-top.
"The burger. The burger is, in fact, amazing. And well worth the wait that we had to endure to be seated. Which was about an hour and a half. But we ordered drinks and they texted me when our table was ready. Once we sat down, service was pretty speedy. So me being who I am ordered the double and I was not disappointed. The drinks are great too. I had an Old Fashioned (shocker) and my friend had some tasty grapefruit and vodka concoction (I don't think it was on their menu). Both delicious. If you're a foodie at all, I would highly recommend Au Cheval! Everything this guy creates (i.e. Bavette's and Gilt) is brilliant. I'm ready to go back."
"My partner, some friends and I were looking forward to a visit Au Cheval, one of our friends and my partner had been there previously so I was looking forward to the experience.  I was told the food is very good and I was excited to get to see for myself.  I don't think I have ever written a review before I usually use word of mouth and share my experiences good or bad that way.  Sadly I never did get the opportunity to find out how good the food was.  We arrived about 8:00PM, which granted is prime time and we expected a wait.  We were told that the wait could be anywhere from 1 hour to an hour and a half which was fine we were in no rush and could kill the time by grabbing a drink, which we did.  The hostess said that they would send a text to one of our cell phones when our table was ready.  About an hour and 15 minutes we decided to just walk over having not heard anything yet we figured it would be soon.  Once we got back we were told that they did text us 20 minutes earlier, which no text ever arrived.  They then said we would be next on the list, being exacerbated I decided to go back in and find out exactly how much longer and to remind them that they missed us on the list since I was not the one doing the communicating  with the staff.  Well the hostess was very rude and said that she had told us that the wait would be 2 to 2 and a half hours, I verified that they had the correct cell and indicated that they were lying.  Needless to say I did not get to have my experience and if this is the face they show the public I really don't care if I ever taste their food."
"Finally made it here. Nice little place, good atmosphere. Had to wait for a table for two, as expected, but sampled a beer at the bar so was not a problem. Told 40 mins, but was probably only about 30mins at 9:30 on Friday. Was a bit surprised at the brevity of the menu, especially as many of the dishes are kind of ""brunchy"". We shared the chicken liver pate, which was lovely and split the double burger and the fries with fried egg. It was enough. Was expecting more, based on its rep, but now I know what it is, that is what it is!! A good bar/diner."
"Its pretty obvious.. This place is awesome.. I've been here twice and hands down one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. You need to get bacon and egg, please! Definitely would recommend, great ambiance, great service, great selection of beer, and great menu. 10/10 would bang!"
"Holy shit Au Cheval is cool. Scratch that, the entire Fulton Market area is pretty damn cool. I really wish a place like Au Cheval existed near my apartment (in NYC), because I could really see myself just chilling at the bar after work every night.I like that this place pays homage to the traditional diner concept, only updated with much better beers and a pretty solid sounding dinner menu. Unfortunately for me, we only had drinks at the bar and didn't have any of the grub as we had dinner plans nearby.My Weihenstephaner Hefe Weiss was creamy, light and very drinkable. I was very impressed with the selection of international beers they had on tap, and perhaps even more impressed with our waitress' knowledge of all the beers they had. The bf had a cocktail called ""the strange brew"" supposedly inspired by Death & Co. in NYC, which contained Martin Miller's gin, pineapple, lemon and IPA. It was surprisingly hoppy and bitter in the right ways, not at all drowned out by the pineapple and lemon. We will definitely be returning to Au Cheval, and linger for longer the next time we visit the great city of Chicago."
"Small menu done right...I love places like this that are a true pup, with a small menu, that they do RIGHT...easily top 3 burger I have ever had...Nothing over the top, just done right, seasoned and cooked perfectly, and they have a good selection of beer to wash it down...Drunk and Hungry? well after midnight they have Chilaquiles, which  are so good you will need to change underwear...Its cozy, dimly lit, and fun...so go nerd!"
"The fries were delicious! I was a bit upset that they did not make their own ketchup or offer an alternative to mayo. The burger was thin and a little over done, probably as a result. The best part was the cheese! Rich cheddar!  The bun was sweet reminding me of a McDonalds burger. If it wasn't for the good beef, charbroiled crispy patty ends, and oozing cheese I would have thought it was a McDonalds burger. It really is a good bang for the buck and very tasty but I probably not worth the wait. We waited at Haymarket, which has fantastic beer, for 1 hour and a half. We called to see why we hadn't received a text and the hostess said she had done so 45 minutes ago to a different number. So we were forced to wait 45 more minutes. This didn't impact my judgement on the food.Weird dancing music. Be warned."
"Met up with a friend here on a weeknight - it's a tiny, busy place so be prepared to get cozy. There was a short wait for a table to 2, but we grabbed bar stools and were totally content with delicious beers. I had 3 really delicious beers with plenty more to choose from. The menu... maybe it was just me and my mood that night, but nothing sounded good to me. Even looking back at it now while I write this review, I don't know. I'm a huge ""egg over anything"" and pork belly or bone marrow person, but I wasn't drawn to much. My friend and I both ended up ordering the burger which was flavorful and juicy, but bordered on being over seasoned. The beer selection and ambience is what will bring me back..."
"OK- I know everyone is talking about this place but THE BURGER.  It is the best thing ever invented, ever.  Well, no not really but it is so unbelievably delicious I can't even keep writing this post because I want to be eating it right now.  This burger is a combination of everything that is good in the world of food.  If you go there- get it!!  SO SO good!  I have had it with the fried egg, with bacon, with both and without either and it is  greasy and mouth watering and oh did I say full of flavor?  The patties are cooked to perfection- yes thats right patties plural, since it coms with 2.  Loaded with gooey cheese, diced picked and onions with the most unreal bun.  This burger was rated the best in the country for a reason!"
"Best burger in the city.  Best fries, probably.  Well worth the wait unless you are starving.  Pretty good cocktail menu.  We had a proper gin martini with a proper twist.  The bartender quality makes all the difference in the world.  On a sour note, why was our the hipster waitresses so snooty?  I thought Chicago was supposed to friendly."
Best.... Burger.... EverScrambled eggs with fois grois - holy cowservice is incredible atmosphere cool and hipOnly downfall is the wait and the fact that there are no reservations available.
great burger! The bologna is a mind altering experience!
Def one of the best burgers in the city!
"Hostess was SUPER RUDE!!!!  Went on a Monday night around 5:30 before the Jay-Z/Justin Timberlake concert with one other person and the place was NOT crowded.  Did not have reservations, but informed the hostess that 2 more people were meeting us, that were NOT going to eat.  She refused to seat us at a table and made me sit at the bar/counter when I was super pregnant, with all the tables open.  So we ordered food.  AMAZING Burger.  AMAZING ham and cheese fondue open face sandwhich.  My two other friends arrived and stood by us eating near the bar.  They were basically kicked out, because they could not stand in a supposedly ""high traffic"" area, when the place was already empty.   If it wasn't for the food being soo good, I would never go back due to the RUDE hostess."
"Went here on a Thursday night and waited around 45 minutes for a table for 2. The place is a lot smaller than I imagined, but it was worth the wait. We split the matzo ball soup, raw veggie salad, and burger with egg and fries. LOVED the matzo ball soup. Very well seasoned and delicious. Raw veggie salad was great. We got the blue cheese on the side, and it was dressed perfectly!Burger was awesome. Thin patties topped with a  delicious sauce---Highly recommend.Fries with egg-obviously good, but nothing incredible. Check this place out but be prepared to wait!"
"Amazing food for reasonable prices in a fun, hip atmosphere! The burgers are incredible (their bacon topper is made in-house and the buns appeared to be brioche). Another reviewer mentions that their single burger is a double, and their double is a triple... although I had read this in advance of going to Au Cheval, I wasn't prepared for the reality of what this meant: their single burger actually has two patties, and thus is huge, particularly if you add bacon or an egg. Being someone who isn't easily taken with fries, the fries were also notably good. In addition to the great food, the beer selection is strong. Lastly, the noise level was sufficiently low that we could converse comfortably - something I always appreciate in a trendy eatery."
"Came yesterday for the first time. All I can say is that is one amazing burger. I had a double with egg on top. I was completely blown away. The burger was cooked perfectly, the pickles were delicious, the bun was soft and held together. Really, really great. We had fries with egg and a couple dipping sauces as well. Next time I will probably go with regular fries, but it was good. The one thing that was slightly lacking I would say is that the waiter was a bit of a scatterbrain. We ordered the fries for an app and the dude obviously forgot as the burgers (which were ordered prob 20 min after the fry order) came out and still no fries. Then after we finished, we asked for the check, which never came. The guy who delivered the food and took out plates actually saved the waiter on both things. Apologized to is for the fries and got them made for us and he brought the check after he cleared the plates. That guy should be the waiter. Didn't catch his name unfortunately. 5 stars for the burger. Def worth the wait."
"Really, really good food, especially for a late night spot.  Their General Jane's Chicken is not to be missed.  I had tried their chopped salad with bacon on a fluke (usually not a big fan of chopped salads) and it is to die for.  You may want to order an extra side of bacon if there are more than two people sharing, because you will be fighting over the last piece of bacon (it is THAT GOOD)!My husband says that their burger is the best in the city.  I enjoy a good burger, but I wouldn't go that far to agree.  If you like whiskeys/ryes, the Horse's Neck is so yummy!  You can't have just one.The service is always friendly and efficient.  Sometimes the host/hostess drops the ball, but you can tell they are overwhelmed.The reason I cannot give 5 stars is because I do not feel very well the next day after eating their food.  Most people would be fine, but I am super sensitive to sodium.  I am totally swollen the day after I eat here.  No matter what I order, I cannot wear my wedding ring the folowing day.  It totally bums me out, because I LOVE their food!  The other reason is it is not a very large place, and has become so popular (they don't take reservations) that there is always a super long wait.  The only time we ever get seated right away is if we arrive right after they open at 5:30pm.  I sometimes don't get out of work until 7pm, and if I get there at 7:30, I won't eat until 9pm, which is way too late for me to eat."
"1st of all, chicago what a town!!!!! having been invited by my international wine/food geek friends, we were in town for the closing of charlie trotter's and also on an epicurean quest to indulge and experience the foodie haven that chicago has come to be.... from a so cal beach girl whose been transplanted to virginia, it was everything and more than i ever expected it to be.  and, my food/wine friends who travel to paris just to dine, said that it was out of the park for them, too!we were walking randolph st (yes in the humidity) and saw ""au cheval"" across the street.  given the name, we expected it to be french cuisine but were happy to find an eclectic blend of american, french and german/american. top that off with a crazy good beer selection and a sparse but finely chosen champagne and wine list, how could we go wrong?  we selected a booth in the back of the restaurant and embarked upon the lunch adventure for the day..... this review might get long so here's the SUMMARY of what we ate rated with 5 stars being the best.  the beers were excellent as was the wine selection (only 5 choices for reds and 6 for whites but covered california, oregon, spain, france, greece and italy). the beer selection was too much to list.  there's something for everyone and covers everyone's tastes from the ingenue to the world's most interesting man.***** roasted marrow bones, beef cheek marmalade & toast***** fried house-made bologna sandwich***** thick cut peppered bacon****  omelet of the day - spinach, triple cream bleu cheese, mushrooms****  chopped salad with bacon, egg & ranch dressing****  fries*      foie gras and pork-stuffed cabbage***** servicei've never had marrow bones served in this manner and it was delectable.   it was a fantasy blend of american and french cuisine at it's best..... the marrow was perfectly roasted and the beef cheek marmalade had the perfect blend of richness from the cheek meat and a sweetness (slight) from what may have been a bit of a balsamic reduction?  it was bathing in the rich drippings from the marmalade and the bones.  no need to embarrass yourself by licking the plate, the chef served texas toast to lasso and corral every velvety drop of the stuff.  french meets american.... perfect!fried house-made bologna sandwich - ok, i dated an ohio guy in my early 20's and he made these fried bologna sandwiches.  at the time, i thought it would be disgusting but one bite and i changed my mind.  this sandwich at au cheval has taken this all-american dish to another level.  the picture says it all.... mounds of bologna lovingly-made pan fried perfectly and layered between the softest bun and topped with something like a mornay sauce.  it wasn't all cheese or all mayo but a warm and slick topping to the beefy slices.  it's a must have.... i can't believe i wrote that!***** thick cut peppered bacon - whew!  pork belly meets american bacon, sprinkled with coarsely ground pepper (light handed) and standing tall in a sticky puddle of maple sweetness (very slight).  how can one go wrong with bacon?  you can't.  give in and submit to the loveliness of this american staple improved by the depth that the franco cuisine can bring.****spinach, triple cream bleu cheese and mushroom omelet - a french version of an american staple.  the creamy eggs were subtly blended to have the consistency of a very thick crepe - french meets american, again :) the combination of the ingredients speaks for itself**** chopped salad with bacon, egg and ranch dressing - a very light ranch tinted with fresh dill, romaine lettuce, crispy bacon bits (house made) with an egg and 2 slices of bacon (see above) on top is definitely not for the calorie counting conscious.  but, all of it was well worth the texture, flavor and visual aspects of the salad.**** french fries - we had to order the fries after seeing individually wrapped portions on a shelf above the fryer.  the french approach to double-frying the fries was in our future!  perfectly salted, crispy exterior and luscious interior and served in a stainless steel cup with paper keeping the top of the fries inside.  the metal cup kept the fries hot to the bottom and all throughout our dining.  simple and genius approach.  the mayo served with this was very eggy tasting.  it must have been house made.  skip the ketchy.... you won't need it!* foie gras & pork-stuffed cabbage - hmmmmmm.  one star says it all but i'll only add that it was dry and had small portions of foie gras embedded in the meatloaf-like behemoth of a serving.  the foie gras got lost and gave up flavor by having to be cooked deep inside the pork.  i don't recommend this dish at all....***** service - i've read other reviews that said the service was mediocre.  ours was fantastic.  attentive but not at our table acting clingy and he didn't flinch when we ordered all that food :)"
All I can say is oh my goodness!!!  The burgers are so good I wanted to slap my momma.  The bacon taste like candy yes I said candy.  Went twice in a week and I'm restraining myself so I won't go again this week.  I think I can eat their burgers everyday.
"Great food and service. The burger was big and rich. If you get an appetizer, you can split a double burger. Any item that has foie gras and bacon will be awesome."
"My favorite restaurant in Chicago,  One of the best burgers in town (if not THE best), excellent mashed potatoes, incredible pastry dessert and great beer variety on the menu.  The bacon costs a few bucks extra, which is probably because it's thick as a sandal and tastes just fantastic. Solid indie playlist for background music.Be ready to wait for a table folks!  Well worth the wait."
"Five Stars:1) One of the best burgers in the city... get it with bacon and egg2) Yes, the wait can be long, but they call you when your table is ready, so you can grab a few beers at Haymarket3) Good beer selection4) Awesome music/decor5) Unlike most restaurants in the city/ something differentBonus: - I know the fried bologna is the no. 2 sandwich in the Tribune 50 best sandwiches, but in my opinion the burger is much better."
"Couldn't believe how packed this place was on a Wednesday night!  They told us the wait would be an hour to and hour and a half, and unfortunately there is quite literally no room to stand and wait.  Even the bar spots are reserved for people on the wait list which we quickly found out when we posted up to try and grab a beer.  Luckily they offer a great service... letting you leave and texting you when you're next up on the list... pretty cool.  Food was great... had a cheeseburger and hashbrowns, both were awesome.  Our waitress was equally great, very friendly and very attentive.  It is pretty tight quarters, and a little pricey (Burger was $14 after adding an egg, hasbrowns were $6, and my beer was $8)... so $28 before tax and tip for a burger, side, and a beer.  Having said that, the burger was so good that I'll def be back... and I for sure only need a single (actually a double) instead of a double (actually a triple... a little confused on why they do that)."
Terrible worst disgusting service ever. They don't listen at all. they are rude. They are extremely unreasonable. We have 6 ppls but two more friends decided to come before the dinner was served. We talked to the guests beside us and they are ok they switch to another table and we actually bought them two drinks for the courtesy  (the restaurant were pretty empty at the time) and the servers came over and rudely said it was NOT ok. RUDE..... Extremely unfriendly
"It was really loud in here when I went yesterday; there's loud and too loud, this place was the latter, I felt like I was at a concert AND it was hot in here, they had the air conditioner on but it didnt feel like it, our whole table was sweating... ew.The only thing that saved this experience was the food.  It was good.  I ordered the ham and cheese fondue that was awesome and my friend ordered the honey chicken which was also good.  If you go here get the fries with the fried egg, the sauces it comes with are great.  Overall, it was okay, its sad to see that chilaquiles are only served after midnight... I love chilaquiles.  And their wine list is small but it's diner style I guess. I'm not sure I'd try again."
Amazing burger but I wasn't a fan of the wait. Really wish they took reservations...
"Great ambiance, friendly service and good selection of beers on tap. The food is awesome!"
CHEESEBURGER. SO. SALTY. Take a glass of water to bed. You'll want it desperately at 4 a.m.
"Visited Au Cheval with two girlfriends on Labor Day.  Walked in around 1pm and checked our name in for an 1:15 minute wait.  Their system of texting patrons when their table is almost ready is quite nice, it gives you the opportunity to walk around to the other spots in the neighborhood without fear of losing your spot!  It was really sunny and nice outside, but when we entered the restaurant it got a little dark... they currently have scaffolding on the outside of the building and it blocks out a lot of natural light.  That being said, the music they played was excellent and a nice mix of new and old tunes.One of my friends got the Bloody Mary, and that drink is chock full of extras!  She had pickles, jalapenos, peppers, olives, etc... they were a tasteful addition to an already tasty beverage.  I ordered the Stiegl Radler (Grapefruit) with Gin- I can't wait to make it at home!!  The beer is already so great by itself, but add a little more booze and it's amazing.  Also, it's rare to see Stiegl Radlers at restaurants, so I think it's a nice touch that Au Cheval offers it.We split the cheeseburger with fried egg and bacon- AMAZING.  The bacon is ridiculously thick, my mouth is watering now just thinking about it.  The perfect amount of fat and grease and pepper.  Then put a great piece of meat on top of that and you have heaven.  We also split the Bologna sandwich.  I've never been a fan of bologna, but it's one of their most reviewed dishes so I thought I should think outside the box... still not a fan, but the girls loved it.  One said she preferred it over the burger, the bologna was thickly cut, and there was a lot of it!Finally, a simple order of fries with garlic aioli-- so traditional yet so unlike any other fries you've ever had.  They were perfectly crunchy and the garlic aioli was like the best thing ever.I would absolutely go back, and order a side of bacon!!!!"
"The brunch at Au Cheval is amazing.  The menu sounds simple but is soooo good.  Had the English Breakfast which came with green heirloom tomatoes accompanied by the most amazing light sauce / seasoning.  Thick cuts of bread and fatty, smoked bacon rounded out the meal well.  Bloody Mary's were a tiny bit spicy and chock-full of fun ingredients.  Decor is barn-yard chic and so cute.  Staff was lovely and accommodating.  Will definitely be back."
"Au Cheval...Au why do you tease us with those cryptic tinted windows and giant wooden panels. Are you playing hard to get? Because it's working. Au why do you deprive the lowly passerby of the mouth watering images of your patrons sucking down luscious foie gras terrines and licking sticky asian style fried chicken drippings off of their fingers. Is it too much to allow the voyeuristic pedestrian to partake in a little vicarious food porn while they stroll down halsted? I live two blocks from here, and it took me this long to get here. Granted, this place is only open for dinner, but once going there, I understand why. The food is impeccably prepared down to the very last details - like their super sweet butter pickles - which are out of this world. They are so good that even if you are not a pickle-obsessed snook-alike, you can eat this side dish stand alone. Obviously it's a killer condiment as well. I could eat here for every meal if it wasn't a bit of a wait to get a table. We waited about half an hour on a Wednesday night at around 9 pm, just to give you an idea. I've tried going in on a friday evening, but had to leave, b/c it was too crowded. This place really is more of a bar, with super-gourmet food. The open kitchen is a plus while you're waiting for a table at the bar. Staff is friendly. But here's the kicker. This place has the best music I've ever heard in a diner/restaurant/bar ever! anywhere! and they play it off an eight track?!?!?!?! seriously?? And of course they played The Roots while I was there, so that took it over the top for me. Don't go here if you are looking for typical diner food. This is diner food pumped up on gourmet steroids without the gourmet prices. It's not cheap, but you get what you pay for. And I would go again just for the toast. It is ridiculous! The chocolate black dog gelato was well..exactly what you would expect. Awesome. But it came with a side of hot fudge that was catastrophically good! Au, Eat it!"
the burger. duh.
"One of my favorite places in Chicago.  Trust me this is saying a lot.  Classic diner feel with gourmet French comfort food.Marrow, Burger, Fried Bologna, matzo ball soup, fries with egg, and beer selection are all excellent.  A group of 3-4 is the best so you can try everything and eat family style."
"Again Yelp really needs a 1/2 star option.  This was between a 3 star and 4 star option, but decided to give it 3 stars.  This review is for brunch - the menu options are pretty limited for brunch, only 8-10 options or so. I ordered the omelette- it was just okay - nothing special.   There was blue cheese in it and you could barley taste it, the onions and spinach were def more predominate flavors. The bacon was awesome though - I am not a huge bacon fan but if every place served bacon like that than I would be a bacon fan. Can't go wrong with ordering it.  Hash-browns were good as well.Service was good and water glass was refilled promptly and frequently."
"Its a very dark restaurant, but they make it work, Their beer list is fabulous, I tried pear beer and now I am hooked! Why the 1 star then? Anything that touches their griddle has PORK. And they don't disclose that on the menu unless you specially tell them no pork. They grease the griddle in pork fat, which is probably why they taste so good. I think that this is something that should be clearly stated on the menu, many people don't eat it for religious reasons and if you are in the food industry thats something that you should know and not try to hide..."
"Here are some things to like about Au Cheval:- Foie gras and eggs.- It's like if a diner were decorated by the set design people from Downton Abbey.- Foie gras and eggs.- Swanky leather booths. Sexy lighting. Attractive staff.- Foie gras. And eggs.- Seriously ramped up diner food. Burgers. Eggs. Foie gras. All together in a big magic pile of amazingness.- SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH FOIE GRAS. TOGETHER. I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT BUT AFTER EATING IT, I HAD A DREAM ABOUT IT AND IT WAS ONLY LIKE, $18.- A pretty bomb ass beer list that also includes yours truly's personal favorite: Budweiser.Go. Eat. Cry into your foie gras and eggs. Thank me later."
Delicious 'single' with two patties topped w an egg.. split the side of perfectly cooked fries w a side of mayo.. his hash with duck heart gravy was amazing.. washed it all down with a delicious Flossmoor Black.. great dinner .. watch your wallet cause your stomach and tongue don't care.. cost $60 for two meals without dessert and three beers..
"I loved the cozy ambience here! The ham and cheese fondue, was one of the best things I ever ate. I felt the fries with fried egg were too decadent, paired with the dish.We had the General Jane's chicken as well. Delicious, but not amazing.The best thing to order is the burger. It is the most perfectly cooked burger I have ever had, with a giant slab of bacon on top! The Frito Chilli is a treat too.The puff pastry dessert was a fantastic finish to this meal.A heavy meal, not to be had often."
"Burger, thick cut bacon, runny egg on top.  All you need to know.  Best burger in the midwest"
I love this place. They have a great beer list but can also make a serious drink the right way. The good is also very impressive considering the hour they are open until.
"Came in late at night and we were still able to order from the dinner menu at 10:55pm. The burger is insanely delicious. I got it with a fried egg and that made all the difference. Also got the fries with a fried egg on top. The garlic aioli dipping sauce was delicious. No ketchup needed. Beautiful ambience. A little dark, but perfect for romance. Request a booth!"
"NOTE: Late night bar menu review only.If you ever need reminding that you live in a world class city go through this exercise.  Fly in from Orlando, FL on the worst flight of your life with a massive head cold and nine thousand screaming children returning from Disneyland.  Watch this flight get delayed and push your arrival to 11 PM.  Arrive at 11 PM and wait 30 minutes for your luggage only to get on a blue line that is repeatedly delayed to downtown.  Get in at 12:20 and haul your luggage from the Grand stop over the Halsted hill and down to the corner of Randolph.  Then walk in Au Cheval take a deep breath and declare yourself mercifully home.  Because only in a world class city  on a MONDAY NIGHT can you still walk into a welcoming dimly lit French bistro/diner bumping George Clinton beats into the humid Chicago night air to a good crowd.So I wheeled my suitcase over to a bar stool and proceeded to unwind.  They have a great beer list.  And said beer list is made even better by the fact that they winnow it into sections based on style of beer like light, specialty, full, rich etc. etc.  So basically I can order something without listening to a bartender describe a beer with a monolgue that would make a 2005 Lafite blush.Upon settling on a delicious bourbon ale I decided to delve into the food side of things.  Being quite hungry the double cheeseburger sounded good.  I was told that the double is really a triple, and the single is really a double.  This seemed to be a needless confusing addition to their menu.  I mean, hell, if they call a double a double and a triple a triple I think everyone involved in the transaction would be better off; but I digress.  The burger was sizeable and good.  The patties were thin, which provided a consistent cook throughout.  The rest was on par with what a cheeseburger should be.  I housed this down with an order of perfectly cooked fries with a nice aioli and stepped into the Chicago night thanking GOD that I didn't live in Cedar Rapids or something where this whole night would've ended with me looking through my fridge for leftover spam or wandering the flourescent aisles of the nearest super WalMart.Can't wait to update this review with a proper meal from their proper menu."
"One of the best burgers ever! My husband had the foie gras and scrambled eggs and wasn't a huge fan, but my friend and I both had burgers and LOVED them. The fries were amazing too. We came right as it opened, which I would recommend or you'll be in for a pretty long wait. But it is worth it. We will be back!"
"Mouthwatering food. Sit at the bar and you can watch them make your food. Cool ambiance too. Burger with bacon and crispy fries with cheese sauce, garlic aioli and fried egg and heffeweisen beer make this girl sleepy/full/happy."
"Do not sleep on this place.  The food here is killer, as is the service, large beer list, and view of the diner-style kitchen.Griddled bratwurst over mashed potatoes with garlic gravy is out of this world.  The gravy is so rich and flavorful, and the potatoes are so creamy.  This dish is a home run.Foie & scrambled eggs: again with the richness.  They managed to turn eggs into a welcome dinner plate though, and again everybody in my group was extremely impressed with this one.Our waitress was also kind enough to send our table a free order of the General Jane's chicken, which might've been the culinary highlight.  Twice-fried chicken, perfectly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, tossed in a dark garlic/ginger sauce.  Seriously I need like ten more pieces of this chicken right now.It's an awful lot of fun to sit at the bar, pick over the beer list, and watch a ton of great looking food items get prepared at what really looks at first glance like a casual diner prep surface.  These guys do a fantastic job."
"I am constantly on a quest to discover the best burger, in Chicago...nay, the world.  Au Cheval made that quest wink at me from afar.My date and I started with the fries with Mornay sauce and a fried egg on top.  They came out and I was delighted to find that the sauce was on the side for dipping as was a side of mayonnaise.  For those of you who haven't eaten fries with mayo, get there.  For those who don't like it, shut up.  No one likes you.  Sauce on the side is genius because it allows for the diner to control the amount.  EVERY FRY GETS SOME SAUCE!  They were delicious. I ordered the single burger, which in fact is two patties.  My date remarked that the waitress didn't ask how we wanted them cooked and this is because the cooks are infinitely wise and we cannot understand.  The burger was cooked delightfully.  Not overdone, not undercooked.  It came with onions, pickles (absolutely a must!) and dijonnaise. Mayo on the inside, mayo on the outside!  I feel that too often burger places don't pay enough attention to the bun.  It is of critical importance.  It must be soft, friends!  It must not overpower.  Au Cheval did it.  I don't like burger patties to be too thick, which is my qualm with Kuma's Corner.  The meat was the right size, the toppings were the right choices, and the bread was not merely an afterthought.  For the first time in my life I used that stupid instagram to take a picture of my meal so I wouldn't forget it.  One star taken away because our waitress seemed like she kind of hated us for no reason. I watched her smile and laugh with other tables and then come to us and give a very strained smile like we had a Groupon (I wish we had!).  Bonus: the music is great.  Between instagraming my burger and shazaaming the music I could barely find time to shove all of that food into my throat (I always find time).  Our waitress did indulge my music neediness, though she looked like she wanted to punch my face while doing it.OH and let me not forget! They have Black Dog gelato there.  I actually chose malted vanilla (who likes borenilla?) and it was a great life decision.  Malt always wins.  It came with its own tiny pitcher of chocolate sauce, too, and everyone loves things that are unexpectedly small and delicious."
"I'm easy to please - never picky - and I have sympathy for busy staff as I was in the restaurant industry for five years. It was safe to say that it takes a lot for me not to find some sort of goodness in what I'm eating or dining experiences, in general. Before attending, I read the first few pages of yelp reviews - and I'd say 75% of people RAVED about this place - so I had no hesitation in going. Sadly, I was unimpressed.SERVICE: The wait staff wasn't friendly, our waiter checked on us ONCE the entire meal, and the food was just OK.FOOD:  I toyed with the idea of getting the chicken dish - as I heard that was killer - but I decided on going with the single cheeseburger and my friend and I split the fries with egg on top. The cheeseburger was extremely greasy and salty - and I LOVE greasy/salty food. I ended up only eating half of it. The fries were pretty good - but once again, SO MUCH SALT. I couldn't even taste flavors, which was my ultimate frustration. The only part that I was extremely satisfied with was the root beer - it was amazing. And it was nice to have something sweet to wash down the salt with. Seriously. Holy crap. OVERALL - it's not a complete bust, but I don't think it's worth RAVING reviews. The good thing is that it's not overly expensive - so I wasn't upset with the quality for the price. Either way, I won't be rushing back any time soon - but I may go back in the future and try something different."
Read an article that this place had one of the best cheeseburger in USA. The meet was cooked right but it was so salty - that it could only be consumed when you really hungry. Good atmosphere and service. I only wish I tried the foie gras - but I don't think I will come back just for this.
"Best burger in the city, love the foie gras & scrambled eggs and who doesn't like potato hash with  duck heart gravy!"
"Short and  sweet review.  Second visit, first time with the late night menu.  5 STAR AWESOME.We were greeted and sat right away.  Attended to courteously and promptly.  Ordered the chilaquiles and two of the single (double!) cheeseburgers.Chilaquiles were a perfect late night snack.  Great combination of flavors.  Not too spicy but enough to get the blood flowing.  There were three in our group and the order was a perfect size for us to devour.The burgers were the bomb.  Both ordered a cheval with a healthy slab of that 'slap yo momma its so good' bacon.Vibe was great, music was great.  When LCD Soundsystem came up, heads were bouncing.If you need a late night meal, stop what you are doing and head straight to Au Cheval IMMEDIATELY."
"I am still wishing I ordered the Cheeseburger Au Cheval. In fact, I'm dreaming of it. It looked so fricken amazing - all melty cheese and fresh fried egg. Everyone around me ordered it.Instead, I ordered the Chilaquilles which although crispy and filled with glorious wicked scrambled egg that tasted so amazing I will never have another egg compare to it, it still wasn't the cheeseburger. The cheeseburger that could have had thick cut peppered bacon in it....Friend ordered the Foiegras scrambled egg. Said it was glorious and very, very rich. I suspect it would be a great dish to share so you can cut down the richness of the dish but I am opposed to the delight of this main ingredient.I was told this was a diner but it I don't think it is. It's more a posh diner if that meant it was a very adult place to hang, dark wood and moody with ""Breakfast Beers"" and other alcoholic delights. Staff were great, service was quick and they have the most glorious hand soap and lotion in the ladies. Chicago, I will be back if just to eat the burger here!"
"I've had the bologna sandwich, burger and general jane's chicken.  All very good.  I am not normally a fan of sweet sauce or honey on my fried chicken. The cook heard me telling this to the person sitting next to me and gave me a taste of the sauce before I ordered and I was sold.  It had a great kick from the ginger and chilli."
"My last visit of Au Cheval was absolutely one of my best dining experience. Good foie grass with French toast, nice cocktail and etc. However today I was quite disappointed with their service, or more specifically, the server who claim herself as a manager.I understand that the restaurant's regulation is first come first serve, no reservation. My 3 friends who arrived one hour earlier before the kitchen open seemed had a horrible and unfair seating experience with the hostess. After me and another girl arrived, we saw our 3 friends sitting at a 4-person table and an empty  2-person table next to them. We came up greeting to them and sat at the next empty table just like any normal people would do when they met their friends. And here comes the ""manager"". She came up to us with a load of words in a rude attitude. All I heard was "" we can't let you seat ... we can't this...we can't that...you guys this..you guys that.. blah blah blah"". While I felt quite annoyed by her I still politely stopped her and said all I wanted to do was just to get a table and start to order, just tell me straightly what you want us to do.She finally stop her can't-not conversation and insist that we had to go to the front door and have the hostess add us to a waiting list. I looked at the half empty restaurant, wondering why they even put us in this stupid process. We went to the front door as she requested. And guess what, there was no one on the waiting list. The hostess took us to the seat where we were sitting before. And believe me, this is not the point where she showed her madness.After we ordered, there were two other friends who just arrived and decided to join us. They were seated behind us. We talked to the 2 guests who were dining next to us that if they were willing to switch seats with our 2 friends who just arrived. The 2 guests said they were happy to do that. To show our appreciation, we decided to buy them a drink. After the 2 guests put their food down at the table behind us, the ""manager"" showed up again and took their food and put it at their original table. Everyone was shocked by her sudden behavior.We said we were all agreed to switch table. Somehow she just wouldn't listen to us and keep saying "" we can't let you switch"". Really? Even when the other 2 guests agreed to do so?I've been to street food vendors as well as Michelin star restaurants. I don't see a customer service can be worse than her. I don't know how she got the manager position. I question her ability as a customer service unless her job is pushing the customers away from their business. If they sell good food but BAD SERVICE, I don't see the point to pay big money for bearing their indignity."
"Ever since that greasy spoon joint that used to be on this streetcorner closed, and this gussied up new restaurant took its place, I've been mordibly curious, especially since Au Cheval is, essentially, a fancy greasy spoon joint. I finally made it last week, and was pretty impressed. ""Open face"" ham and cheese is more of a queso fundido with high quality ham mixed in - overall not entirely unpleasant, but not what I was expecting.  Salmon special is simply and perfectly cooked - probably the least decadent item we ordered, but one of the most satisfying. The side of bacon is an absolute must order - it'd be more accurate to call it ""sliced porkbelly roast"", as it is nearly an inch thick. It has great flavor and melts in your mouth - as a big time bacon lover, I can say with confidence this is among the best bacon offerings in the city. Frites are served in maximally indulgent fashion; topped with a fried egg, and served with high-octane aioli and Mornay sauce. They are very good. Though I didn't taste it myself, the burger ordered at the table got rave reviews; I'll have to try this on my next visit. Pricing is surprisingly reasonable for the caliber of food; most of us paid under $20 for multiple items, including tax and tip. Service is European-style; they allow you to enjoy your company, but at the expense of a little slower pace. For me personally, that's a huge plus. All in all, Brandon Sodikoff has done it again with Au Cheval; while the calorie content is comparable to the old occupant of this space, the similarities end there. A solid addition to Randolph Street!UPDATE: The burger also deserves elite status, especially when topped with aforementioned bacon."
"Cliffs: excellent bar, excellent food, disappointing for vegetarians who actually want a meal.This is very near a 5-star place. Aesthetics are wonderful, cozy and inviting. Music selection was modern and a bit out of keeping with menu, which made it even better. Wait staff was extremely friendly and warm. Now, on to that menu ...Drinks: oh man. Five stars and more. The cocktail menu isn't really extensive, but it is packed with excellent choices and they are impeccably made. I think the sidecar I had was among the best two or three cocktails I've ever had. The beer list is lengthy enough and includes many good choices. Food: loved it. Creative menu, top-notch quality. Flavors and textures were wonderful, and even relatively simple dishes elicited comments because they were exceptionally done. It's not a low-price place, though. Looking at the menu items and prices, it seems pretty pub-food normal: burger for $11, things like that. But no sides are included and most dishes are small. Figure for two people to have dinner, a drink, and dessert , you're going to be in for $60 or so. Not crazy, but not quite the neighborhood drop-by-every week range, either. And the food is worth the money.I'm knocking off a star because the menu is pretty limited for non-meat eaters. There are plenty of ways to create substantial, filling, vegetarian/vegan meals that taste good. It seems to be a common conception that vegetarians only eat vegetables, and they only want salads ... not so! Seitan, tempeh, avocado, chickpeas, quinoa--there are tons of filling, versatile, and tasty ingredients that can be cooked in all kinds of different ways. The chefs at Au Cheval are clearly talented, and they need a real meal for our meatless friends. As I regularly dine with vegetarians, this oversight will limit my visits to a place I would very much love to come by often."
"Seven of us from work went to Au Cheval during lunch. Get there early, don't go in groups more than four, and don't move their tables to accommodate your seating requirements. Place is small, very tightly spaced (important if you walk in with a big coat cuz you can bump into other tables and such), and there is no seating available for groups larger than four, maybe five people. Even if you split your group and sit at two tables next to each other, they don't let you move the tables/chairs. They don't take reservations either. Host/hostess and managerial service is not good, although our waiter was very nice and accommodating as possible. The manager was very rude to us when we moved a small table that was being occupied by members of our own group. The food was very good-a little more expensive than my normal lunches-but totally worth it. The cheeseburger was one of the best I've ever had. I didn't care much for he fries, though the portion size was huge. All in all, good experience. Would've given it five stars if it wasn't for the rude manager, and if the establishment was a little friendlier and less snobby. Reminded me of the restaurants I went to in Paris-same douche bag demeanor. Lol. Good place for a date but not so good for a work event. Worth going at least once, especially for the burgers."
"Went to test out the ""Best Burger in Chicago"" claim, and guess what: they passed with flying colors!The burger was perfect. It had elements of every flavor and sensation:The bun was soft, warm and toasted.. The patties were thin, hot and perfectly seasoned.The pickles were crunchy and delicious.The bacon was sweet, charred and smokey.The egg was glorious and the sauce tied it all together.I'd eat it again and again.We also go the fries with the mornay sauce. It was pretty good, but not amazing- The fries were just s bit too cooked. I'm also a tough sell since it's hard to beat Gene and Judes fries. The beer list is cool with some interesting selections. And the root beer float with a shot of whiskey was top-notch. The malted vanilla ice cream it's served with has a bit of salinity which pairs swimmingly with the root beer."
"Not bad.  I do enjoy french fries for brunch, and with the fried egg and garlic aioli, it can't be turned down.   My husband had something I will refer to as a meat platter.   He was happy with it: duck gravy (with sausage) and hash browns. The portions are giant and salty. If I had even two drinks the night before, all of this would have been perfect.  But, I wasn't ready for high-end diner food.  Perhaps you are.  I'm saying it's perfect for hangovers."
"Au Cheval! Au Cheval! Au, yes. I assume when the guys over at Gilt Bar, Curio, Maude's, Donut Vault etc get together and decide to do a higher brow ""diner"" things are going to go well. And they have. Even without the super powered industry folk behind it, Au Cheval gets a Au+ in my book of West Loop hangs. It may have been why I headed over after a few cocktails at Sepia...but it certainly shined all on its own. And can we all just take a moment and reflect on HOW MUCH BETTER the West Loop restaurant scene has gotten over the past 3 or so years? Thank you, thank you, thank you. It was nearly on the verge of extinction. Adios Jerry Kleiner, hello everyone else! It's alive with the sounds of goats, diners, french jazz and rock 'n roll. I love it. Ok, back to Au Cheval. Our part of 4 arrived (complete, of course!) at 730pm on a Thursday and were told it would be 30-35 minutes. It was comfortably buzzing, the bar pleasantly full, the tables brimming with diners and fried chicken platters whizzing by us in mass proportions. We were shown over to a small corner of the bar to wait (it seems they've much improved this process from early March, based on reviews). A friendly server came and took our drink orders, brought them to us, and transferred them seamlessly to our table upon being seated, which was just about 30 minutes, though it flew by. I enjoyed a Strange Brew (gin, IPA, pineapple...who knew!? Now you do), my friends tried various beers, wines. There really is something for everyone, that cocktail list truly stands out though...and reminds you, ""oh yes, The Gilt Bar guys."" Nonetheless, we were happily chatting and found our way to a cozy booth about a half hour after entering. Smooth as butter. After being seated we ordered another round (I stuck with Strange Brew) and we opted for a few dishes to share, as the menu is extremely heavy. If you are on a diet, I actually don't think there is anything on the menu for you...perhaps the fish? Come prepared for some good eatin' that's going to break your calorie bank. Our selections: *Chopped Salad with thick cut bacon and wonderfully rich dressing. *Open-Faced Ham Sandwich Fondue *Fried Chicken *Fries w/ Egg(you see what I mean!?) Even the salad is ridiculously caloric and indulgent, not that I think that should stop you! Everything we had was so, so, so rich. All arrived hot and fresh, as any misstep with those kind of dishes (perhaps save the salad) would be fairly disastrous in presentation. Judging by the amount of food remaining (nary a scrap) I think we can suffice it to say that we enjoyed it. By no means is it going to be as crazy delicate and fabulous as Maude's or Gilt, BUT this is their take on a diner...so I think if you prepare for that going in, you can get your eat on and enjoy it quite well. Portions are smack dab in the middle, verging on larger-than-expected. Prices are par for the course and with drinks and these four dishes we were at about $130 without tip. Not too shabby as our cocktails at Sepia were ALMOST that much! We were all stuffed and I am now vowing to eat lettuce for the rest of the weekend, or until I head to dinner tonight. Au Cheval, well done. They've worked out some of the service kinks they may have had (we had exceptional service from entry to exit), the food is rich and sinful, they are open later than most in the 'hood (2am), and their bar is well stocked and ready to get you pretty sauced. Another win in the West Loop."
"Honestly the best burger in the world, I'm not exaggerating. I'd suggest adding the bacon to the burger, but really you can't go wrong no matter how you order it.  Make sure you get there early so you're guaranteed to get a table."
"No diet fare here. Seriously. Don't tell JHud or her Weight Watchers posse, Jenny Craig, and just sign out of myfitnesspal RIGHT NOW. That's a good thing, though. Au Cheval promotes itself as a Euro-diner of sorts and that is evident in its egg and cream-laden menu. I happen to love both of those things, so I was good to go when this place was mentioned as a dining spot to keep our lady love evening going.The service was fabulous. From the host staff who kept tabs on us to seamlessly ease us into our table, to the servers who not only took our drink orders and also took great care of us at our table. We felt attended to quite well.We enjoyed:-Chopped salad. Not a light version, by any means, but this was a divine salad. Big chunks of bacon and egg adorned creamily-dressed greens? Jenny Craig would say N.O., but I say Y.E.S. -Ham and cheese fondue. More of a dipping sauce served with thick slices of bread, more rich creaminess. Decadent.-Fries. Nothing wrong with salty fries topped with a fried egg and accompanied with some creamy sauces.-Fried chicken. This was tasty, but probably my least favorite dish. Perhaps it was because I had filled up on creamy goodness before it arrived? Yeah, that's possible.-Gelato. From Black Dog? Served with some hot fudge on the side? Yeah. We went there. Three scoops.I had the Horse's Neck cocktail, as I'm a sucker for anything ginger. In fact, it was so nice, I had it twice. We were all pleased with the beverage options (we ordered a variety of the cocktails, beer, and wine.)Two chubby thumbs up. Diet can start tomorrow, right?"
"I've eaten here three times in the past month.  Suffice to say that I like it.The atmosphere is 3 stars.  It's a handsome space, but if you don't get a booth, the tables are a bit close to one another, you are almost all in your neighbors' business.  Also, the music, while the selection is good, is very loud.  Like crazy loud.  You definitely have to up the decibels to carry on a conversation.  So if you are looking for quiet and intimate, you are going to get neither.The service is four stars.  I've been here during the week and the weekend, around 7 or 8 p.m., and the longest I've had to wait is twenty minutes.  When you get seated, the wait staff is very attentive.  I feel like the staff - square footage ratio is high, so you don't get any long lulls of inattentiveness.The food is four stars, but this is a very heavy menu.  If you are expecting light and/or summery dishes, you are in the wrong place.  In my three trips, I've had the foie gras and scrambled eggs (twice), General Jane's chicken, bone marrow with cheek ""marmalade,"" and the burger and fries.  The stand outs to me have been the foie gras and eggs and the bone marrow.  Again, not exactly food you want to eat in 98 degree weather, but delicious.The beer list is five stars.  Thirty plus taps of mostly American, a sprinkling of Belgian and German.  I love drinking Kolsch in the summer, they don't have Reissdorf, but they do have Sunner.  Prices in line with other places.The cocktails are four stars in taste, two stars for value.  The cocktail list only contains classics, e.g., Hemmingway daquiri, side car, etc.  Probably the only modern cocktail is the Strange Brew, but that is a non-original concoction from Death and Co. in NYC.  And the cocktails are all $12 a piece.  If I'm going to pay $12 for a drink, I want originality, not a drink from a well known recipe that I can make at home.  If you are champing at the bit to spend this kind of dough on drinks, go to the Drawing Room or Sable, which have really innovative drinks.  Shoot, if you want to have great, original cocktails for $8, go to Longman and Eagle or the Whistler.  There is no reason to pay $12 for a Hemmingway daquiri, and that's one of my go-to drinks.In short, check this place out, but if you want your bill to be under $100 for two people, drink beer and skip the cocktails."
"These guys do believe their burgers are the best and customers shouldn't mind to be treated like crap. Well, actually crap is treated better by the Department of Sanitation, I would say. One-hour wait to be seated on a Thursday night at 10:30 PM, huge delay in serving a simple beer while waiting for the table, we complain and the general manager basically said ""if you don't like it, you can leave, we're too busy for you"".Of course, we left. What a bunch of douchebags."
"There's a new ""best burger ever"" on my list after eating here.  Sublime, full of complex flavor - perfection in a burger.  Also, great atmosphere, and extensive draft beer selection."
"Okay so the wait was not as long as our host said it would be (2 hrs), but it was still pretty long. Totally worth it though! My bf and I shared the griddled bratwurst with smashed potatoes, cheeseburger with added thick-cut bacon, fries, and roasted bone marrow. The cheeseburger stole the show! My bf said it was the best one he's ever had. I still dream of it! If it wasn't for the wait, we'd probably be there every weekend getting our chubby on! The brat was also very flavorful and the fries, which you have to order separately were plentiful and were accompanied by this aioli that was like crack! So good. L&E still has my favorite bone marrow, but this one was not by any means bad. Next time we're going just for the burger and NOT sharing it!"
"This is like Maude's 2.0 and that is a very good thing.The pros:-  Great value for the price (huge portions)-  Chill and chic ambiance-  Upscale diner menu items (my new favorite genre??)-  Beer, wine, and cocktail menus are all equally great-  Friendly and prompt serviceThe cons:- This place will get too popular and have long waits in a few months.Go here now!"
"After reading so many great reviews on this place my wife and I decided to check it out.  One word can describe our experience, ""Underwhelmed"".  Upon walking in we were met nicely and quickly sat.  Not a surprise since it was around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon.  We came hoping to grab the burgers we had been hearing so much about but to our surprise were told they only served brunch until 4pm.  Seriously, WTF, its Saturday afternoon, burger and beer please.We decided to suck it up and order off the brunch menu and grab a couple of beers anyway.  We ordered chilaquiles which consisted of a massive pile of chips, one scrambled egg, a couple of clumps of queso fresco, a couple of slices of jalepeno, and a large handful of unchopped cilantro.  Needless to say the worst chilaquiles I have ever had.  We also order fries that came with a bechamel sauce and egg on top that weren't to bad actually.  We had 3 beers to drink and then asked for the bill so we could go somewhere and get real food.  To our surprise the bill was $55, now we  are not cheap and I understand West Loop prices can be inflated but for what we got we were hugely disappointed, especially seeing $17 for chilaquiles that were a pile of shit.  Definately wont be going back.The only reason I am even giving the place two stars is because of the courteous service and nice ambiance."
"I had a friend in from out of town over Labor Day weekend when we came upon Au Cheval. We had really wanted to go to Little Goat for brunch however we were not about to wait 2hrs to be seated. I have wanted to try this place for a while so it was our second choice. I LOVE THIS PLACE. The servers and bartenders were amazing and very helpful. The bartender answered all my questions about certain drinks he was making behind the bar and the waitress was nothing but sweet and quick. She noticed my friend's suitcase and rushed our food through so we could get my friend to the airport on time. We ordered the famous cheese burger, fries and the ranch & dill salad. Everything was made to perfection and nothing was left on our plates at the end. I can't wait to come back here at night. It definitely seems like it would be more fun on Saturday night when you can go in an try all of their different beers on tap that i have never heard of or their specialty cocktails that seem like one will be enough haha."
"Aaaaaah, Au Cheval!  I loved this place!  They don't take reservations, just like most delicious new restaurants, but we hung out at the bar and sampled from the craft beer list until a table was ready.    The matzo ball soup is something to behold, biggest matzo ball I have ever seen in my life and it had great flavor!  I ordered a special that was salmon cooked three ways and mixed with creme fraiche served on toast with pickles.  Such a simple dish, yet so interesting at the same time; I don't think I will ever forget it.  We ordered the fries for the table and they were worth every sinful calorie!    The menu is kind of small, but they do everything well and that is what matters in my opinion.  I will be enjoying more dinners here in the future."
"My cousin was a big fan of the foie grae, eggs and toast. It was pretty yummy and the eggs tasted dim sum crepe like. The burger was pretty good but I desperately wanted to put ketchup on it (even though my cousin said it would be a waste). We only got a single though which was more than enough. The ox marrow bone was unique, but it just tasted like fat/butter. The amazing thing about that dish was that cheek marmalade yummmm. Everything was great and service was good (despite not ordering drinks while seated at the bar counter) We came on a weekday at 8pm and waited half an hour. The only thing missing was vegetables.. even their salads come with meat. Also while the fish is prepared simply, you get 2 pieces and the chef was sniffing it first to make sure it was still okay so probably not the thing to get here. The things you see when watching the chefs cook.."
"I just  went there  for a birthday dinner. waited for  over an hour but i had expected to wait since it is a small place and  it is a thursday night. Food  is good. I had the general jane chicken which is good . It  reminds me of General Tso's chicken which you can get from a chinese restaurant.   my friend ordered a burger which was greater as well. dessert was nice as well.  Food is good but doubt i will return anytime soon. The place is small and the music is so loud that you have to yell to talk. I quite listening to the waitress and just asked my dinner companion what she said.  In a place this size, loud music destroys the ambience. Also having to shout so that the table next to you can listen to your conversation is not  having a quite dinner. If you like noisy place with good food this is the place. it is very crowded so if you are not sitting next to a wall be prepared for someone   brushing up against you frequently. i live in the area but   don't enjoy dinner where shouting is involved .I should have just brought my bose noise canceling headphones.  I rarely  write reviews but   i would have enjoyed dinner much more if i could have heard my friend instead of listening to the conversation of the two inebriated men next to us."
"Holy Calories. Went here for a mini celebration for my lady on Saturday night.  We went slightly before 6pm because we were that hungry. The place had the layout of a corner diner and the ambiance of a gastropub, all dark wood and metal. My eyes were immediately drawn to the collection of craft and Belgian beer taps. All tables were already full so we sat at the counter. I would highly recommend this as you get to see the chefs work their short order magic and they even mingle a little when they can come up for air from the constant influx of orders.The beer menu is fantastic. I was pleased to see St. Fuillien Brun on tap so I started with that . Then I moved onto a fantastic black IPA by Stone called Sublimely Self Righteous and ended with a lighter Belgian ale that escapes me. Mi Amor likes the dark ales and had 2 brown ales and a stout that were all great.As others have stated the food is heavier than a whale that just ate a rhinoceros. We shared the fries with an egg. It came with a garlic aoli and a cheese dip made of gruyere. Some of the best damn fries I've ever eaten. The egg mixed with the cheese sauce and the aoli on crispy fries...holy shit. So as you can see fat is a major component of all the dishes. It seemed that everything either had egg, cheese or foie gras. Next we moved onto the marrow bones with ox tail marmalade. Again, totally amazing and totally gut busting. We finished the savory portion of our meal with a ham and cheese fondu with, you guessed it, a fried egg. By this time I was contemplating a future purchase of stretchy pants. We just so happened to be seated at the counter in front of the chef in charge of the dessert station and noticed he was making a napolean type pastry as we were on our way to becoming Lipitor poster children. Of course we couldn't leave without trying it...of course it ruled. Service wise our waitress was totally on point with the beer and the food recommendations and the chef we were seated in front of was more than happy to tell us all about the lovely foie gras terrine that he was cutting up. My only ding on this place is that it's pricey. Sure the portions are gigantic and ideally shared but it ain't cheap. But then again I plan on going back for the terrine and the fried chicken, and maybe the Foie omelet or that baloney sandwich I've read so much about. You got me Au Cheval...you sons o' bitches got me."
"Yum! Au Cheval is a pretty solid brunch place located in a newly developing area of interesting and trendy restaurants. Got into the restaurant around early lunch time and it was pretty empty so we got seated right away. The interior is made to resemble a pub with a sophisticated feel.I ordered the English Breakfast which was pretty darn amazing. It had a couple thick cuts of bacon, texas toast, scrambled eggs, tomatoes and baked beans. Everything was so flavorful and rich. I also had a taste of my boyfriend's burger which was AMAZING and a bit of foie gras. These people know how to cook extremely heavy and rich foods, but after eating it for a while, it kind of just sits and your stomach because everything is so fattening but oh so sinfully good. I couldn't even eat dinner after this brunch because I ended up being full for the whole day. Recommend definitely, but perhaps make your trips here infrequent so you don't have a greasy artery clogging heart attack."
We went there for a late night snack. I don't remember the names of the foods we got but we ended up with a mega nachos which was pretty money.  Hit the spot.  We ended up getting a dessert that was ridiculously good!  Some sort of pastry/mousse dessert and every bite was awesome.  Place was a little packed but we were seated fairly quickly which was nice.  I'd go back when i'm not buzzing so that i can remember next time.
"My favorite burger... maybe ever.  Eaten good ones in LA and NYC, but this is one I keep craving.  Their bacon is unreal.  I had the pickle back too, a must since they make their own pickles.  This place would kill it in LA."
"Just had a disappointing first experience at Au Cheval - rude, slow service and average food drowning in butter (I couldn't finish my scrambled eggs because there was so much butter in them.) The Bloody Mary however, was yummy. I've heard such good things about this place and was really hoping to be impressed. Not so much."
"I dined here on Tuesday, March 18th. I stood in the Waiting Area because I was waiting for a friend, and a manager ushered me in, insisting (in a good and friendly way) it was fine for me to be seated, as it wasn't a heavy traffic time for them. Our server was great at recommending items and was very familiar with the menu. He was really patient with us, as it was our first time here and we shared two items, which he coursed for us. We shared the Toasted Open-Faced Ham and Cheese Fondue (yum) and the Cheeseburger with bacon. The burger was AMAZING. I think....it's the best I've ever had. I recall saying multiple times during the meal, ""This is sooo good."" I also tried the Teddy Bear Kisses beer. Don't let the name fool you (silly and adorable), I picked it because I love stouts and this semi-local (Indiana) Russian Imperial Stout hit the spot. I will be back and I will probably not share my burger next time. Our drinks were well maintained and the whole staff was friendly."
After spectacular drinks at Little Goat we headed to Au Cheval on a recommendation.  Seated after midnight hence ate off the late night menu.  If fatty marginal late night bar food is your poison this is your play pen.  Chilaqueles were meh.  Drinks were awful.  Small menu.  Nothing healthy.  Even with loads of fat it was...  meh.  Pass.
Terrible service. Extremely long wait for overpriced average food.
"Au Cheval = Au Mazing!More than I expected, it's fun, sexy and delicious. The atmosphere is inspiring and the food/drinks rock. We had the potato hash with duck heart gravy (after which, I was craving more of for at least a day) and we sipped on the Strange Brew (my favorite) & the Hemingway (great, too). I have a feeling that much like Maude's, everything will be outstanding. Bonus points for our adorable/sweet server! She was really funny/charming - and you could tell passionate about the spot, too.I can't wait to go back."
"I echo what a lot of other people have said - the cheeseburger will change your life and is without a doubt the best I've ever had. The down side is that they are always packed so the wait is usually an hour or more so it's hard to feed my new cheeseburger addiction. The food price is reasonable, alcohol price is a bit high but not unreasonable given the neighborhood."
"We came here for an early dinner. We had not wait. I ordered a delicious beer and the others ordered great cocktails and whiskeys.The burger was the best I've ever had. So perfectly created. I added bacon to mine and the others added a fried egg as well. All were great additions.It is a bit pricey but well worth the expense. Seriously, best burger I've had,"
"I just can't with this place. I've tried to like it, The concept behind it is great, but just because you're supposed to be a diner, doesn't mean you have slather everything in grease and mayo. It's still a $10 burger with $5 fries on the side. Not to mention, this $10 burger had two very thin patties, so when I ordered it medium rare, I was told they don't do that, but the patties will be a little pink in the middle. Child, if I wanted a double cheeseburger with two thin patties I'd go to the Billy Goat and pay half. Now I know. Not to mention, the burger has like nothing on it. Cheese, pickles, and mayo. LOTS of mayo. My burger was dripping. And I'm pretty sure the bun was slathered in melted butter. Which, if you're into that sort of thing, awesome. But if I'm essentially paying $15 for a burger and fries, I'd like them to be a tasty burger and fries. Now after I've just shit talked the tons of mayo, I'm gonna talk about how delicious it was - ON THE SIDE with the fries. When I was in charge of the mayo to food ratio, it was much more welcome. It really is good, I just wish they wouldn't have drowned the burger in it too. My friend ordered the potato hash with duck heart gravy. He always seems to order the better entree, so then it's me picking at mine and his and him giving me the go ahead and eventually the stink eye when half his food is gone. Having said all that, I'd like to end this review on a food high note, because it's not a terrible place. It's A-OK! Their rootbeer floats are RIDICULOUS. They have rootbeer on draft. And it'll change your world, like - ""I didn't know root beer could BE this way"" change your world. Now, add to that gelato. Yes, gelato - it changes the game. Also, the decor is awesome. It's like a gothic version of the Edward Hopper painting Nighthawks. Very low lit, dark stained wood furniture, the booths are upholstered in black vinyl and tufted pretty heavily. I love it. The floors are white tile (usually white tile is a big no no because the grout turns black and then it looks dirty) but here it works. The bathrooms are gorgeous and clean. Glazed subway tile seems to be the hot new thing, and that's okay because glazed subway tile is gorgeous. Think - the Gage, and the new Jam in Logan Square. Also, the line cooks seem to be enjoying what they're doing, so that's always fun to watch. Which is also not typical for a diner, usually back of house is sweaty and miserable and shouting at each other or the wait staff."
This place has a ton going for it.  Excellent beer list.  Excellent cocktails.  Excellent French fries.  The burger is a little overhyped as it is really greasy.  It honestly reminded me a lot of culvers which is fast food if u didn't know.  Not that I didn't like it.  I went for lunch on a Friday so the wait wasn't a problem for me.  Ambiance is a big plus here.
"Came here about 9:35 on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately, greeted by multiple staff members (who gave us GREAT recommendations when we asked). Quality beer menu - this definitely isn't your ""quick cold one"" kind of bar. Fried Bologna Sandwich? HEAVEN.Burger? AMAZING (x2 - both guys I was with drooled over theirs)I highly recommend getting the fried egg on everything you can. Delicious!"
"Great experience.  We started with the muffin, which sounds pretty simple but was amazing. The burger is a must. Super messy but well worth it.  The meal is definitely on the heavy side though, so be prepared to sleep after."
"It seems that everyone has their two favorite ""go to"" items they order each time they come here.  Try to go with someone who will share so that you have a variety.  Nothing comes with a side, and portions are a good size, but eating just a burger, even this burger, isn't as much fun as trying two things. You must order the burger, with the egg and bacon.  I have always been skeptical of the egg on a burger thing, but DO IT!  Incredible.  I crave this.  I have a hard time describing the deliciousness; just please believe me.Chicken....boring?  No!!!!  The general jane's honey fried chicken is truly phenomenal.  Give me a spoon for the sauce - six pieces of chicken, with a wet towel.  Delish!Went with two girlfriends who wanted a green.  Really?  Throw some parsley in with the french fries and that is green enough.....but they had to get the raw vegetable salad.  I didn't notice the apple....but the blue cheese and shaved beets were great.  It was delicious, but really, fries or salad- FRIES!Good selection of beer, cider and wine.  Great cocktails.....Go early if you don't want a wait.  We went at 5:45 on a Monday and got the last table.  Noticed quite a crowd outside at 7 when we left. Yum!"
"This might be my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Start with a pickle back shot, they make their own pickle juice...amazing. Foige gras scrambled eggs are my favorite, but the burger is in discussion as one of the best ever. The beer and cocktail list are way above par as well. Get there kinda early or put your name in and grab a beer at Haymarket, they'll text you when your table is ready. Don't snack there though, you'll want the bone marrow as an appetizer..."
"Service was great, room is comfortable and the music is good.  We went for the burger and we were disappointed.  The single is 2 patties.  It was fine but not terribly flavorful and isn't something I'd go back for.  The side of bacon was great and the salad was yummy, if a bit over dressed."
"If Au Cheval's Single Cheeseburger isn't the best burger in Chicago, it's at least top three (along with Kuma's Corner and Hot Chocolate). Make sure you get it with ""bacon."" I normally feel like bacon on a burger is excessive, but these thick slices of glazed ham are possibly the best part of the burger."
"There's not much to say that has not already been said in countless reviews of this place, so I'll keep this short.  My husband had the obligatory cheeseburger with bacon and egg and I branched out into the crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy.  Everything was delicious.  The potato hash was cooked to a perfect balance of crispy outside to potato-string-goodness inside without feeling at all greasy (not that this was a light dish by any means!).  The only reason I might consider ordering something else next time is to get the fries that come with the burger, but as long as I'm with someone who is willing to share a fry or two, I will likely be back to this new favorite."
"What a wonderful place to visit. I went there for drinks with friends after dinner in the area, so my review will not include anything from the menu.The space is hip and crowded, but the crowded part only added to the ambience. A mix of individuals, from trendy metrosexual to shirt-and-tie to Sox/Cubs hat types. We were seated at a table since the bar was full. Had an Old fashioned and a Sidecar, both were awesome. I'm sure dinner there would be great but it is worth the trip simply for the booze."
"I know that this review is early, and I know that it's probably way too long. But it's the inaugural review. Fair warning. As of tonight, Au Cheval is not yet officially open to the public, and there's no published date next week (of 2/20/12) when it will be. However, thanks to a few strokes of fate, nice people, and amazing luck, my restaurant-mongering best friend and I stumbled down to Fulton Market yet again to see if we could get in the front door. It had been on our list for months. And tonight, to our surprise, we walked up to find that it was open, and that we as strangers were some of the few welcome to join the full house of staff and friends for a test dinner.Au Cheval is not like Maude's or Gilt, though people are inevitably going to compare them. Picking between these three would be like picking a favorite child for people who actually love children. Au Cheval's promise of the 'diner concept' is different than what you would expect. No linoleum, no kitsch. This is a true small, craft diner: 40ish seats in a corner shop, hefty wood tables, and a menu that's as much about beers as it is about eggs (layered in duck heart gravy and foie gras). It's a dark, sexy, gritty, and intimate place. They'll have limited kitchen service late night (they think) and a shot of whiskey is an affordable $3.50. Want to wash your hands in a vintage basin and a rain showerhead faucet? You can do that here.The expectations for the food here were sky high since we've been waiting forever. The food here is... absolutely phenomenal. We took our first bite and shook our heads, then said WTF, then shook our heads more. Our server was confused. We told her this was a good thing. We had the double burger (3 patties), the winter greens, peppered bacon, beef stew with marrow bones and texas toast, and mashed potatoes with garlic gravy. The burger is fall apart melty tender, layered up with Ameri-Cheddar, red onions, and dijonaisse (an unholy blend of two things I typically despise). Winter greens in sherry vinegar were a nice sharp cut through the meat fat. Pepper bacon was thick, hot and seared perfect, the potatoes were delicious, and the beef stew - chunks of pot-roasted, fork tender meat with red wine glaze, the classic marrow in bones, and texas toast to spread it all on - was impossibly good. We went caveman on that bone. We would have licked that sauce too but we figured we were weird enough as it was. Dessert was giant mille feuille layered with pillowy vanilla custard creme and then HACKED THROUGH with a giant knife at the table. We ate it all. Though the beer draft list (we are beer junkies) is incredibly designed and carefully picked, we got sucked in by the Horse's Neck cocktail: rye, lemon, ginger beer, and angostura over ice. Twice. I have had more cocktails this month alone than I can count and this is right up there, far beyond new speakeasy darling Barrelhouse Flat. Beers are either light, rich, or full. Next time, we are getting on those drafts.We lingered a lot. At some point, my friend finally caved and ordered the damn fried bologna sandwich she wouldn't shut up about (this apparently impressed onlookers - she is the girl who ate a whole dinner and is now eating a fucking bologna sandwich). But this lingering and absurd eating led to something cool: Brendan Sodikoff himself came over near the end of our nearly four hours here, to introduce himself and to ask us what we thought of his new place and where we would tweak it. We wouldn't. But after meeting him it makes a lot of sense now why his places are so consistently good. In that vein, service here is really solid, and though it was funky tonight (cooks were serving friends, etc) everyone here is friendly, quirky, opinionated, and smart. Ask for a beer recommendation, and you are going to GET one. The music makes the concept, as usual. A little old school rap, a little funk, a little of the cabaret flavor you probably will recognize. It has its own relaxed mood going on, and we lingered a long ass time here without ever hearing anything twice. Their music curator (Scottie) has a gift. That's about all I can say.This place is going to RACK UP the crowds once it opens, and at under 40 seats I predict getting a table will be challenging given that they don't (and can't) take reservations. Hopefully we'll be able to get back in again a few more times before it takes off, because we love it, and unlike high-concept stuff that gets old after one experience, we'd want to eat here again and try all the FOIE they have. But if we can't, we'll have had this - one beautiful, fantastic night at a place we already suspected would be amazing, that still managed to outdo all that we hoped it would be.  Our other 5-star reviews seem sort of dubious now, and not up to par. Au Cheval just makes us care less about our long list of restaurants to hit. We'd rather just go here."
"Disclaimer for what might be a below-average rating: I'm a vegetarian, so my meal was limited. I wouldn't mind so much being limited in terms of options, but said options were also super limited in terms of substance! This place has an amazing-looking creative menu for the omnivores, and my companion really enjoyed his sausage on a bed of delicious mashed potatoes. But the veg options are pretty much zero calorie. I had a raw vegetable salad. It was delicious, but there wasn't even bread to go alongside, so it was not substantial at all (especially for somebody who had stupidly come in after a 5 mile run looking to chow down). That being said, my bloody mary was awesome (lots of horseradish!), as was the rootbeer float at the end of the meal. Really, really great.I'll be back, but probably more likely for a snack and a drink. The environment is great and the staff members were helpful and kind. The venue wasn't quite the every-week type gastropub situation we were looking for - in part because it's pretty expensive. But, good stuff to be had."
"Don't come to Au Cheval when you're trying to cut back on calories, but it sure is worth the trip.We sampled and shared quite a bit, so here are the highlights:Salmon Rillette: A fresh start to the meal.Bone Marrow: I almost gnawed it off the bone.Fried Chicken: Not overwhelmingly spicy, which is just what I was in the mood for.Au Cheval Burger: Bacon. Egg.... Burgers will never be the same again.And for those with a sweet tooth, they carry Black Dog Gelato.Nom. Nom."
"Maybe the greatest restaurant in Chicago of all-time, from the mixed green salad with herbs and a lemony vinaigrette to the double cheeseburger with a side of smashed potatoes with gravy. Holy f*** did I just eat all that. Oh yeah, yeah I did and you should too. Drop everything and get to this restaurant now!!!"
"Warning: if you are counting calories, watching your figure, a health nut or trying to fit into that dress that is too already too small then avoid coming here!The food here is rich, tasty, and full of flavor. There is no skimping on the butter, fat or whatever else is bad for your waistline. The beer selection here is pretty decent and can appeal to even the non-beer drinkers. I do admit the music is loud here. My table couldn't hear each other and kept saying ""whhhaaat??"" over and over again like it was a Lil John song. Besides the loud music, I enjoyed the food! The foie gras with eggs and toast was heaven in my  mouth. The eggs were so light, so fluffly, topped with foie gras gravy then with big chunks of foie gras that it could turn any vegan towards the dark side. I am not a bread fan by any means...sorry bread just don't do it for me, but the toast that came with my eggs was buttered perfectly and toasted on the outside and soft in the middle that it made me think twice about having a better relationship with bread. The fries with the fried egg and garlic aioli the whole table enjoyed...maybe too much since that was eaten up quick! As for decor, its cute, dark, nothing fancy or anything. My friends complained it was too dark and busted out their iphone flashlight app to see the menu. Yes, it is dark int their but not as bad as tango sur. Overall, great place just don't plan on finding low cal items."
"This place was a restaurant! It was really an interesting one. Here were some of the interesting thingamabobs: First, they have the most f'd up shot in the history of the world. Jameson with a pickle juice chaser! Huh? It was the best shot I've ever done. From now on, I shall bring a jar of pickle brine with me to every bar I ever attend. I can use it to chase my shots, and/or dump on a douchbag's head! I will then say to that douchebag  ""Ha Ha, you are a pickled Douchebag!"" I figure a fight would probably then break out, but hopefully it would be old-western-y like the one from Bill and Ted's excellent adventure when they kidnap Billy the Kid. In continuation of my meal of morbid curiosity and obesity, I ordered a fried bologna sandwich. It was fried, and bologna-y. Wow! My heart of hearts is clogged with death causing processed animals! We also had some sort of ice cream attack. It was good, but I don't remember that part very well due to the aforementioned shot concoction. In summation, this place is very good and I hope you do not get a shot in your concoction."
"OMG!  I don't know why it took so long to go to this place.  I flew into Chicago for a three day visit and after missing the concert due to flight issues and delays I was not a happy place.  Made it downtown and one of my best friends picked up and said that he was going to take me to eat the best burger in all Chicago and some say in all the US.He was not f'ing kidding.  This place used to be a Gyro shack but a couple of years ago got converted to the magical place that it is now.  Got there twenty minutes before the ""full menu"" was done for the day.  The waitress said it would not be a problem if we took our time and ordered.  The beer selection was awesome, the special for the night was Chili con Carne and it was one of the best restaurant chili's that i've ever had.  Then to the burger, everything is cooked in butter!  The single is two 4oz patties and it was tender, juicy, every bite was better than the last.  This is the elevation of a classic no frills burger to perfection.  I did not get the bacon on it but did get the fried egg and the yolk was the best condiment that the burger could have on it.  My friend did get the bacon on it and it was not over powering.  I will make it one of my regular places to go whenever I'm in Chicago."
"a-ok is a very apt description of this place. the bar/diner thing is a cute idea but i think the food needs some work. it was good, just not as good as i wanted it to be from looking at the menu and getting excited for it.started with the foie gras terrine, which was not the best i've had. it wasn't as creamy as i've had before and a little gritty from what felt like salt. i know it tends to be salty, but i think this is the saltiest terrine i've had. it came with a tart cherries compote or some other kind of  sauce and that was a great idea and delicious. it also came with buttered texas toast. i like a giant slab of toast with liver any time but i really hated how buttered it was, especially when pairing with something as heavy as foie gras.i ordered the hash with duck heart gravy, which was a huge portion of food. i like the diner portions! the hash itself was super super crunchy. it came in crispy chunks and was so crunchy that i think it must have been deep fried. the gravy was delicious with nummy chunks in it. the egg on top was an essential and tasty touch. i really liked eating it, but i'd recommend anyone share it since it did start getting really heavy in my throat after a few bites.i also tried the bologna sandwich, which wasn't bad but super super salty. i know that's just how these kinds of meats are but i really do think they went beyond the normal saltiness of bologna. i really liked how it was sliced thinly though. it definitely felt good to bite.the place itself was super dark, which i know is a good sign for some people but just never has been for me. the music, though good for the atmosphere, was also insanely loud. our waitress was pretty nice, although i think she brought us the wrong beers. overall, just a place where the food is okay. since most stuff was pretty cheap, i wouldn't mind coming back. i'd just try to temper my expectations."
"I didn't think much of the food, it is trendy and although each item is somewhat good on its own, there isn't really a cohesive vision. I did find that the draft beer selection was the real draw for me. They have several beers that I've never even heard of before and their menu provides a brief synopsis of each beer's style and flavor, which is really helpful towards making that crucial decision. The service is great too, while standing or sitting at the bar a server will actually come up to you rather than having everyone yell their beer order over to the bartender. What a novel and pleasant experience!"
"Three days later and still thinking about my burger from Saturday night. This place was incredible from beginning to end. Service - impeccable. Food - incredible. Atmosphere - unique, modern, and yet comfortable. I will surely be back, perhaps sooner than later. And yes, the bacon is pricey but worth every penny. If it's your first time there do NOT skimp on the bacon. Also great location regarding the CTA. Bus and train lines are near as well as a few bike lanes so easy peasy traveling."
"Going to Au Cheval has made me question whether or not some of my past reviews really deserved five stars. The bar has been raised. Also I apologize in advance for this tome of a review, but I'm still in this bologna, burger and general meat-fueled endorphin high. It was a four hour glutton fest that ended with me eating a fried bologna sandwich after three rounds of drinks, dinner AND dessert.Ending up here was a happy accident. Walking by, the lights looked on, but the tinted widows made us doubtful that Au Cheval was actually open. We cautiously tried the door, and it wasn't locked. Good sign. We stepped into this dark, sexy diner and were seated in the back. The booths and long counter are classic diner decor, but the color scheme involves a lot of black and dark woods. To describe Au Cheval in one word: badass.The food, oh my god the food. We went balls out on this meal: beef stew with marrow bones and toast, smashed potatoes and roasted garlic gravy, cheeseburger, winter green salad and thick-cut peppered bacon. Our waitress said the burger was probably one of the best in the city, which for a not-really-yet-open place is a big claim. The patties were thin and griddled, the cheddar was melted perfectly, the bun was soft but stood up to the burger juices, and the Dijon and mayonnaise took it over the top. My friend and I bit into it, and we had no words. We just looked at each other with this ""How is this happening to us right now? Why is this so good?"" kind of expression on our faces. The peppered bacon is super thick, think canadian bacon, and is meaty and salty and awesome. You can cut it with the side of your fork, it's so tender.  In the middle of this meat-fest, we had the winter green salad. It was just what we needed. Light, just acidic enough, and it came in a heaping pile. Perfect.  My friend and I have an insatiable love for bone marrow, so sopping up the beef stew juices with a thick piece of Texas toast smothered with bone marrow was ridiculous.  Things I will need to get in the future: everything in the ""With Eggs"" category (potato hash with duck heart gravy!), griddled bratwurst, chopped chicken liver with toast, and some others that I'm completely forgetting.We followed up the main portion of the meal with the mille feuille, which they've spent months perfecting. It shows. The three layers of crunchy puff pastry are separated by a creamy, medium-bodied vanilla cream. When it's brought to your table, with a quick swipe, they cut it down the middle with a butter knife. Absolutely delicious but probably best split between three or more people. After all of this food, I still wanted a goddamn fried house made bologna sandwich.  If you think this is any old bologna sandwich in between two pieces of white bread that your mom begrudgingly made for you as a child, stop. The bologna is sliced super thin and is piled onto a fluffy bun with what I believe was mayonnaise and/or Dijon. No matter the condiment, the bologna was the star. It was salty and flavorful and worth the ridicule from my friend. However, the staff at Au Cheval seemed to appreciate my inner fat child ways.We were not as adventurous on the drinks. The cocktail list features more classic concoctions than Gilt or Maude's. If you check out the Au Cheval tumblr, you'll see the thought that's been put into the food and drink selection. A ton of effort has been put into the beer list, so it seems like they're trying to push the casual, beer-drinking vibe more. It's actually a pretty nice change. The beers are separated into light, rich, specialty and full categories to provide a little guidance. If you aren't sure, ask your waiter - ours was really knowledgeable (and ridiculously friendly) and had good suggestions. After two rounds of the horse's neck cocktail, I had a Stillwater Existent while my friend was tapped out. The horse's neck has rye whiskey, ginger beer, lemons and some bitters. It was light and citrusy but not overwhelmingly sweet.If you are into the Sodikoff aesthetic, you will probably love this place. While it resembles Gilt and Maude's, each place holds its own. Au Cheval is more relaxed, which is why I love it. The music is less vaudeville than Gilt with a mix of rap, jazz-y funk, rock, etc. At the height of dinner, we were rocking along with the music and by 9 the songs became more chill but picked back up around 10, timed perfectly with the crowd.  I'm coming back, and I'm never going to leave. Or at least I'm going to sit here for another 4 hours and eat a bologna sandwich while drinking beer.Also $3.50 whiskey shots and $6.50 picklebacks. Seriously?!"
"Really neat place to dine at, especially for dinner when you're looking for unique hamburger type of food with a twist.  Rootbeer floats were delic too made with homemade ice cream."
"I'm shocked at the great reviews on this place...I really am....So its a diner/bar...kind of interesting.Walk in on a Tuesday night around 730.  We were meeting someone so we asked the hostess if there was a single girl sitting at a table...she said that she didnt have any single people sitting at any tables...weird...because I had gotten a text from my friend saying that she was there waiting.  So I stood there for a second and then we decided to just take a peek.  Sure as shit, there she was.  Weird...the place is very small so I was kind of confused how the hostess could have misplaced her.  Anyway, we sat in a table kind of by the bathroom.  The first thing that I noticed is they pack it in here.  I felt like a can of sardines on the jumbotron.  My chair kept getting bumped and battered by everyone that walked by...including servers, patrons, etc.  It was slightly annoying.Service...lackluster...boo!  We sat for awhile and finally the girl came and took our drink order.  We then sat for at least 15 minutes before we could place our food order.  Also, they have carafes of water on the table...ours was empty...twice...we had to flag them down to get more...not a good sign when you cant even keep up with the carafes....The drinks were really good!  I thought those were worth going for.The food...well the menu was a little sporadic and I was kind of confused for awhile.  It seemed like it was split up weird.  Like apps and then eggs...but some things that seemed like apps were under eggs and vice versa...?!?  The omelette of the day was good.  It was 3 eggs, spinach, caramelized onions and cream sauce.  It was good, however, it was PRICEY.  It was like $12...no toast, no potatoes...I thought this was a diner?  Also, we had the bacon, egg, salad...again, it was good.  I ordered the matzo ball soup.  Well for $8, I was expecting a lot.  Nope, disappointment.  First it was in a beef broth...which was not mentioned on the menu...also, matzo ball soup usually has chicken in it...there was nothing...no chicken, no beef, no nothing...one big matzo...that was good, it damn well better be for $8.  It was ridiculously priced.  Also, it was laden with dill.  Again, very weird.  There should have been a description on the menu if it was going to not be traditional matzo...lame.  The pork, foie gras stuffed cabbage was great.  It was really, really good.  Although, I didnt really taste the foie gras.  I would get that again.  We tried the pickles...$5 for a small side bowl of them.I dont know, it seems like Au Cheval has an identity crisis, like some people are saying about Santorum...I doubt I will be back to see if they resolve it..."
"This place quickly jumped from something I was most likely mispronouncing to one of my absolute favorite restaurants in the city. We had a fantastic experience and every time I consider where to dine out this place pops up in my head. We started with the salad greens (tasted SO fresh), griddled brattwurst (mashed potatoes were so smooth and creamy), General Tso's fried chicken (better than Crisp, I think so!), and a side of french fries with garlic aioli. Washed all that down with a couple Horse's Neck drinks. (Old overholt rye, lemon, ginger beer, angostura) I'm interested in trying everything else on the menu. Everything. Including the Pickleback, a shot of Irish whiskey chased with pickle brine. I'll be back."
"Love this place, but LOVED this place when it first opened and there wasn't a 2 hour wait on a Thursday. The food is always amazing...porterhouse is tender (God forbid you mistake this for beef...), burgers are like everyone says, top 5, LOVE the chicken, the foie gras is good, but was better when served with the cherry jam and the aioli is so freaking awesome I could drink it with a straw! Music is total chill..just an overall great find.This last trip, we took my parents who were in town visiting for the holidays.  Food was still awesome, but the waitress was rude.  Not ok for as many people as we have recommended come to eat here. Annoyed :/"
"Burger, bacon, and egg is on point. Add a tall boy shlitz and you got a meal.  Cool environment, candles and natural lighting, fun songs w a little base.  Don't be suprised to hear the early 2000's hip hop on a Friday night."
"Yum, Yum, Yummity, Yum! What a delicious treat my BF gave to me.  The food was great. the wait was long (but worth it).  I had the cheeseburger (which is really a double)and a order of fries with egg. YUM!  We also ordered the bacon...which is really ham..so GOOD!  Au Cheval! I love you. I only gave them four stars becaue our server was a little pushy and judgemental when we were ordering....weird."
The food was great but the menu is limited. My favorite part was the Jameson shot with the pickle juice back.
Great burger!Keep it simple:  Order a cheeseburger (no need for the way too thick bacon!) and a whiskey- you'll be feeling like right as rain.PS. Just find a seat at the bar or you'll be waiting a while for a table.  (Or go off hours- it's always packed)
"We found unusual, interesting dishes on the menu.  Food tasted good.  Also, the place is open late.  Looking forward to another visit."
"This is a tough review for me because, while I don't think Au Cheval's food  is objectively ""bad,"" I didn't enjoy dining here at all.  My date and I came here for a very late dinner after a play - I think we arrived at Au Cheval around 10:30 on a Wednesday.  There was no wait; in fact, there were several tables open.  We were seated immediately and started pouring over the very extensive beer list.  Our waitress dropped by to see if we were ready to order and was happy to give me a sample of one of the beers before I ordered a full glass.  So far, so good.Au Cheval doesn't have a menu online, which is a bit odd.  If you look at their tumblr or read the reviews here you'll pretty much get the whole menu - it's tiny with very limited choices.  I think there'd be virtually nothing a vegetarian could eat but the salads.  We opted to start with the potato hash with duck heart gravy.  For mains, he ordered the burger with bacon and I, with fond memories of my grandmother's fried bologna sandwiches dancing in my head, ordered Au Cheval's version (without egg...according to the waitress the chef has tasted both extensively and decided it's better without).  We requested that everything be brought out at once.Which it was...sort of.  The kitchen had put egg rather than bacon on my date's burger.  He asked that they fix it, which they did, no big deal and we dug into the potato hash.  I have to say, the hash wasn't what I expected at all.  It's more like big chunks of cut potato casserole covered in gravy.  I thought it was good, if not terribly exceptional.  My date's corrected burger showed up - I thought the waitress was a little flip about the screw-up - she just said ""That was my fault, sorry!""  But whatever, we were hungry and it wasn't a huge deal, so we dug inot our sandwiches.  Unfortunately, I really disliked my bologna sandwich.  It was missing some element to cut the fat and heaviness - it's essentially just a huge pile of friend bologna on a buttered roll.  I thought the taste was extremely one-note.  I wasn't able to eat more than four bites before I gave up.  The advantage of dating is you're never limited to your own entree, so I snagged a bit of my date's burger.  It was much better than my bologna, but still really heavy and one note.  It, again, needed something sharp or some kind of vegetable to cut the incredible heaviness.  The few pickles on top weren't cutting it (Side note: Au Cheval's pickles ARE amazing.  Best I've ever had, hands down.)When our check came, both of the burgers (with egg and with bacon) were on it.  We had to wait to snag someone to take the extra burger off the bill.  Again, staff were really casual about the mistake.  Though to our waitress' credit, we asked her about the reel to reel tape deck at the front of the restaurant.  She brought a reel over, sat down, and spent about 5 minutes explaining the restaurant's music program to us.  It was really cool and she was enthusiastic and adorable.  Overall, by the end of the meal we were both just feeling weighed down and...gross.  We agreed that the menu is odd and really skewed towards heavy, heavy dishes.  Seriously, I've eaten hashbrowns, bacon and eggs from Golden Nugget and left feeling light as a feather compared to how I felt leaving Au Cheval.  Date said he'd go back but leave the bacon off the burger and order a salad as a starter.  I think Au Cheval's food is just not my style - I can't see myself returning."
"You know that Seinfeld episode with George and the pastrami? I wanna do that with Au Cheval's burger.Things to get: Jane's fried chicken, the hash browns and if it's still around, the salmon rillettes. The scrambled eggs with fois & Texas toast is pretty ridic too. Great beer selection including $3 High-Life and Hamm's tall boys.Shane-O, OUT."
"fantastic absolutely delicious! service, food, ambiance was perfect!!!"
"I plan to go back and I might then update this to a 4 as it was a 4.5 (wish yelp had half stars).  Best bacon I've had- hands down.Great beer menu.Solid service.Fun atmosphere.Good fries with egg on top.General Jane has a large, good chicken.& the bologna sandwich is second to no bologna.  Yes- i certainly shared and was able to taste all of these.  I recommend Au Cheval and plan to go back soon."
"General Jane's Chicken is amazing!!This is my favorite restaurant 2013!  Love the atmosphere, food and service.  The wait is ridiculous so either go when they first open or be prepared to wait, but it is so worth it.I have not had a bad meal here, but my favorite has to be the General Jane's chicken.  They must put crack in the sauce because I am still craving it.  The burger, baloney sandwich and fries are also outstanding."
"The concept of trendy diner is interesting. I would say the rest of the menu is more intriguing than the burgers because you can get a better burger somewhere else. When items are listed with duck gravy and foie gras, why wouldn't go you for those items instead? If you come here, it's going to be for the ambiance. It's a very trendy cove with low lighting and a dark interior. I agree with the other reviewers that the music can get a bit loud, but the seating is very close together so I'm sure you'll hear the person across from you. The beer selection is good and the cocktail menus are nice. Do end the night with some Black Dog Gelato though...It's a nice place for a low key date or if you want to capitulate the idea of a trendy diner."
"What a burger!!  Oh my gosh, I never though I would enjoy a thin, griddled patty this much.  The millefeuille was pretty incredible as well."
"Drinks? I'll have them.A single with Bacon and cheese? I'll have that as well. Oh, Hello Bologna Sandwich. You're about ready to make me a sweaty meatbag of a diner, aren't you? It's alright, we can be friends, but you're the worst friend I could hope for. It's a good thing I'm not friends with the borings."
"Loved this place!  I'm a sucker for anything French but I was hesitant when I saw the menu because everything looked so HEAVY.  I originally planned to order a salad or something light but that is basically impossible at Au Cheval.The bf and I ordered the bone marrow which was SO MUCH BIGGER than what we expected.  It was basically both sides of the cow's femur.  We're used to little knobs of bone.  Toast was excellent, marmalade was a nice touch as were the beef cheeks.  Marrow was juicy - we've had better marrows but this was still tasty.  We had a hard time finishing both pieces and then remembered we also ordered the duck hash and almost started crying.  We ate 95% of it; it was crispy in some areas with the sunnyside-up egg as a nice touch.  We were here at 8:45 PM on a Sunday and it was packed but had no trouble getting a seat.  The service is slow but the good music makes up for it.I'd definitely come back - I hear the burger is good - but I will make sure that I fast before I do so I won't feel absolutely disgusting and depressed after I eat here."
"Had brunch at Au Cheval a few weeks back and it was great. I had the simple breakfast - don't let the name fool you, there's a lot of food. The eggs were great, the bacon was delicious. Actually didn't go to Randolph planning to go to Au Cheval, but glad the other place we wanted to go to was booked. I will definitely be back."
"BEST BURGER!!! I don't know what it is, and even they can't explain, but it just is!!  Simple delicious!! Try the pickle back shots too!!!"
"Our friends rave about the food here, but it wasn't for me. I'm not a fan of duck or pork is probably why which I found to be really heavy on the menu. My husband had the burger with the egg on it and he really liked it.The portions were really really large, but the nachos I had were a little oily/greasy and I was hurting after. I don't like to hurt after when I eat out. If you're not a big eater, think twice about getting a full entree. The space is also a tiny rectangle and really busy on the weekends. I wasn't entirely comfortable."
"Absolutely love love love the atmosphere.They did a really great job with decor, and the beer list.A little pricey on the drinks, but still very good.Try the Jameson and dill pickle juice shots.The Sesame Chicken wings are so juicy and tasty. heaping portion.I did notice a lot of  Foie Gras options on the menu, which I am not a fan of or process of.Cheeseburgers, exceptional, however it would be cool if they offered more options besides with egg or bacon; maybe some other cheese options, or sauteed mushrooms or onions.Either way, very good, and I highly recommend with Egg (Au Cheval).Friendly staff, knowledgeable, and overall a good experience.Even chatted it up for an hour or more with our dining neighbors, so people that dine there are pretty cool too).The food is so good in fact that I was more than pissed I left my leftovers at Nellcote."
"I've gone through life firmly believing that eggs (particularly, runny eggs) on anything makes things better. Forget a spoonful of sugar or the inexplicable cupcake craze - fresh, old-fashioned eggs is where it's at. So naturally, the fact that Au Cheval opened is a sign that anything ""with eggs"" is heaven sent.The music mix here was great - clearly, someone took the time to carefully craft the eclectic soundtrack, and it's noticeable in a ""this-mix-is-really-awesome-didn't-think-those-­songs-back-to-back-would-work-but-does"" way, not a distracting blow your brains out way (ahem, Nellcote). If you don't get a booth, be prepared to love thy neighbor because you will be packed in tight. On to the foodstuffs! My friend ordered the General Tso's fried chicken and it was worth the mess - really good and covered in chiles (but still not too hot). The frites with runny egg and aioli was to die for, and as if that wasn't enough fried starches for one meal, we had a side of hash browns too which were perfectly crispy, as they always should be. I ordered the bologna sandwich au cheval (runny egg, obvs) and it was a tad too salty for me. Next time, the burger is mine. The mille feuille was delicious and despite the behemoth size wasn't as filling as it looked - delicate and flaky and omnomnomgood.For my fellow Maude's lovahs, Au Cheval offers the same lyonnaise salad that I'd like as my last meal. Beware that everything is pretty rich and meat heavy - definitely comfort food. But that is not a bad thing. I can't wait to go back."
Stopped here on vacation in Chicago. Me and my boyfriend were looking for a good old fashion American diner with a modern feel and this place delivered. The Menu was a bit confusing to understand at first but we got though that. Wait time for the food was average. Food was delicious! I practically inhaled my burger. It was juicy and moist with the perfect amount of greasiness you want in a burger without being overkill. Solid restaurant for a first date.
"A great find on a Friday night when the restaurant my boyfriend and I originally planned on sunk below our expectations. Enter Au Cheval, the evening's knight in shining armor! The atmosphere was lovely- like if an old western bar met a 5-star restaurant. The music was very indie and played on an old analog tape player. The service was great, and although there was a 20min wait the food was well worth it. I had the Ham and Cheese Fondue with a fried egg. And I'll tell  ya- heaven is a place on Earth, and you can get there with a fork.I highly recommend this place. I predict it's popularity is only going to soar from here on out, and, if this is so, you're going to have to fight me for a table!"
"The wait is a long one, but definitely worth it. Put your name in and go across the street for a beer. Get a burger 'au cheval' with bacon and egg on top! Single cheeseburgers are actually doubles and doubles are triples so keep that in mind. Usually don't like super odd foods but their chicken liver appetizer is very good so try something a little different. Great craft beers but even better cocktails. Enjoy!"
Huge fan! There almost every Friday!
"Being a fan of Maude's Liquor Bar and Gilt Bar, I was eagerly anticipating the opening of Au Cheval, the aforementioned restaurant owners; ""diner/bar"" approach. I was not disappointed.The space is relatively small and fairly cramped, but that just adds to the overall feel of the place. It's dark and loud, but not so much that you can't hear each other talking. They have a large selection of beers on tap, and a small but diverse menu of items to choose from. We started with a winter greens salad that was tangy and light. Good way to start since the other two dishes we would get were heavy and rich. The foie gras scrambled eggs came next with a butter brioche toast, and it was the highlight of the meal that evening. Yea, it was rich, super buttery, and you could feel your stomach expanding, but that wasn't the point. It was delicious. I wanted more, but at the same time knew I couldn't finish the entire dish if I wasn't sharing. Definitely share this with someone else, the portion is rather generous with 4 slices of the buttery toast provided to pile on the foie gras and eggs.Our last dinner course was a ""single"" cheeseburger which strangely comes with 2 patties; the double comes with 3. No complaints there, it was one of the better burgers I've had in a while. The bun was crispy on the outside but airy and light inside. We also got the fries which were crisp and paired well with the garlic aioli. The food was inhaled in between conversation. Dessert was a french pastry with a marshmellowy cream in the middle. I only had a small bit because I was so full, but it was unique and good. The pastry was think, light and crisp. Seems to be the favorite dish here.On a Friday evening around 730, our wait was short; come before 7 and you'll likely be seated immediately at a table or at the bar if you have a party of 2. Service was outstanding! After being seated, we ordered our food with recommendations from the server, finished our meal, and stayed for another 90+ minutes, and we weren't rushed. To be honest, we lost track of time but it was nice to be able to sit and enjoy the meal and conversation without much interruption. I'll be back with other friends soon."
"You know what I love most about au cheval? It's not screaming and yelling to be heard. There was no splashy opening, it got a little bit of press through tasting table, etc, but this place is really letting the food, drink, and ambiance do the the talking, which is a breath of fresh air.  We strolled in, sat at the bar, listened to the music spinning on the reel, and felt like we easily belonged there in our casual Friday night clothes.  I could still be reeling from my less-than-awesome experience at Tavernita, where i was throwing 'bows with girls in stripper heels just trying to get a place to stand, but this place is real, down to earth, and knows what it's doing (is it any surprise with Sodikoff at the helm?)The boys chose from the laundry list of craft beers, many local, and I had a cocktail.  I was happy to see that some of the cocktails were more reasonably priced than Au Cheval's cousin Maude's down the street (not that their cocktails aren't worth $12 - THEY ARE - but sometimes a gal needs to protect the wallet a little, yaheard?), but also delighted to find that the quality of the cocktail was not compromised for a lower price tag.  We didn't get a chance to eat, but everything coming out of the open kitchen behind the bar looked divine, and like something mom would make (that is if mom were a 5-star chef working at a diner, you know what i mean). I'm excited to welcome Au Cheval to my 'hood with open arms, and am chomping at the bit to get back and get some of that beef stew with marrow bones in my belleh. Mr. Sodikoff and team, hats off."
"This review is based only on their system for how to get a table here, my girlfriend and I arrived around 10pm on a Wednesday night, place was packed, we gave our number to the girl in front and were told we would get a text, we then go to our car just across the street to wait.  20 minutes or so later we get a text saying our name is on the list please respond, I respond by saying we are waiting across the street, to me saying that I was expecting this place to reply saying come over your table is ready or something of that nature but nope, what do I get in response? ""OK"".  Excuse me? But what? Ok? Seriously? What does that mean? Not wanting to go back in there again until it was time for us to sit down I continued to wait for another hour in my car with no other yet from this mysterious person.  I have to say I am more than livid with this ridiculous experience, I wanted more than anything to try this place because I've heard such great things.  This is not OK.  I am pissed."
"We walked to Au Cheval on a beautiful warm sunny day in September. Upon walking in our eyes took a moment to adjust, but our sense of smell and sound took over. The Music was loud, but fitting and the smells... wonderfully intoxicating. We waited 25 minutes, but worth the wait, my husband had the cheeseburger, the bacon was 1/2 an inch thick and the bun melted in his mouth. I had the ham, egg and fondue cheese, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. Tried a new beer (and am hooked) Stiegl Radler hints of grapefruit, smooth. Our server as were the other staff were attentive and our water glasses were never empty."
"Still 3 stars... I was hoping that once the service stuff turned around, it would be better.  But it just isn't that great.  Our waitress this time was awesome, very kind, very attentive.  This time, since the shiny new-ness had worn off, we realized that the food was just OK.  We ordered the pickles, matzo ball soup (ratio of ball and broth off), ham and cheese fondue (too much cheese), and a couple of drinks each (beers, bloody, and mixed drink).  Nothing was life changing and our bill was $90.  The atmosphere is where it's at at Au Cheval."
"I'm not going to lie.  I was saddened when my favorite late night gyro/pizza puff/french fry place hung newspaper on their windows and closed down.  But after much thought and realizing that my 3am forays into pulmonary heart disease were indeed in the past I opened my heart to Au Cheval.  If you know the old gyro place(sad that I don't even know the ACTUAL name of the place) it was very skinny and long.  The layout is the same with the cooking actually happening right behind the bar.  They did a great job renovating the place.  New flooring, new ceilings, new walls.  It all is dark and alive with bass beats.  We were surprised on a Wednesday night at 8pm that  there was a wait.  The hostess was super friendly and we ordered drinks at the bar while we waited.Mr. Man perused the beer menu while I absorbed the food.  Lots of foie gras and meat going on here.  The pickens are slim for the veg people.  They seem to favor eggs on a lot of their food and I am kicking myself that I forgot to ask where they source them.  We settled on a cheeseburger and fries for Mr. Man and smoked salmon & poached salmon w/soft boiled egg and a side of the garlic mashed potatoes for me.  Mr. Man had the hard cider and I the prosecco.Our food arrived quickly and upon the first bite of toast my heart stopped, in a good and bad way!  So delicious.  So buttery.  So bad.  I let Mr. Man have a bite and than told him ""that was just 300 calories.""  Yum.  So good but definitely not something I can have on a daily basis.  I will admit that I spread some of the mashed potatoes on the bread and closed my eyes as I fell into carb heaven.Mr. Man will probably hit Haymarket across the street which is more his speed(he did say ""no tvs?"" upon entering) and the beer is 1-2 bucks cheaper for the same stuff.  The food is delicious but not something that I could indulge in on a regular basis.  Heavy stuff that makes me ready for bed though I should probably run an hour on the treadmill first.  My heart will thank me."
"Following on Eater.com's top Chicago restaurants, we had Au Cheval as our first eating spot upon arriving to Chicago via O'Hare airport and dropping off our bags at the hotel. We arrived within an hour of the restaurant closing for their afternoon break before dinner and we were told there is a waiting list and we may not get seated before they close. We risked it anyways and waited inside. About 20 minutes in, we got a table, and placed our orders for the Foie Gras scrambled eggs w/ toast and Hash w/ Duck Heart Gravy. The restaurant inside is small with a few tables surrounding a counter with barstools facing an open kitchen. The scrambled eggs were rich, the foie gras taste strong, and a great dish to start our food adventure. The duck heart looked like ground beef but much heartier and had an irony finish, and the potato hash came in as fried cubes of flavor. We were glad that we waited and able to try a restaurant that just opened a few months earlier. If this is Midwestern fare, California needs to adopt it."
Good service. Best burger I had in Chicago. It's somewhat dark inside but that's part of the atmosphere. Not to be missed!!
The burgers are superb! A single is a double and a double is a triple! From the patties to the pickles inside everything is just great. I would suggest getting an egg on top and also a side of bacon (to share its a big plate). The bacon is the thickest and most flavorful bacon i've ever tasted. The duck fat fries with garlic aioli was a great side. My friends got the General Janes chicken which tasted great but the 18 dollars seemed a bit steep when you could get a delicious burger for less.
"Dating a foodie is great, because then I get to go to places like Au Cheval, which I never would have found on my own and now cannot imagine my life without. I've been here two times. The first time was with my girlfriends, and the waitress looked at the four of us little Asian girls and suggested the salad, which she said was ""light, while other things on the menu are really heavy."" Skip to the heavy stuff please, we are here to eat! And bring us four $3 handsome tall boys while you're at it! (Oh, they're drinks? Nvm)On to the food. Potato hash with duck heart gravy. I could seriously eat this every day of my life. The hash is made well-done and crispy, balanced out very well by the amazing gravy. Toast with foie gras and eggs. First of all, anything with foie gras is going to be great, but this was way beyond expectations. The toast was extremely buttery (my favorite) and soft, and was paired perfectly with the scrambled eggs and foie gras. Burger. SO good. Everything was seasoned perfectly, and you must get it au cheval (with egg) of course. General Tso's chicken. It's real chicken, so expect it to get a little messy, but it's totally worth it. Fried so the skin is crisp but not too greasy, with a tangy sauce. This chicken bears no resemblance to a similarly named entree at Panda express. Fries au cheval with garlic aioli. I mean, it's fries and garlic aioli. Need I say more. Overall, awesome dining experience. The only thing that could make this better would be if they had seating for bigger parties. It doesn't look like they're able to seat parties of more than 4, which is a shame because I want everyone to come. They also apparently have a 32 oz porterhouse (with foie gras), but there are only 2 made per night. They ran out by the time we got there, but that just means another excuse to go back! I'll see you soon, Au Cheval."
"If you can handle heavy food all the time this place is amazing.  I think offering some lighter fare would help me appreciate the awesomeness of their main delights.I have been here twice and everything was at least good.  We tried bone marrow and beef cheek marmalade.  Not a fan of marrow, but the toast was buttery and delicious and the marmalade exquisite.  I wish I could drop the marrow.We tried the fried bologna sandwich on our first visit since I wanted something other than a burger.  Now that I know what the burger tastes like this was a mistake.  Not bad, but there are so many worthier things to bust your gut with here.The fries with egg and aoli are out of this world, easily the best fries I have eaten anywhere.  My wife had to compliment the chef, for FRIES!  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with just the right amount of salt, these fries will take you to divine places.Our second visit we went with duck heart gravy hash and the burger.  The hash itself is very good, though I found the gravy a bit disappointing.  They can do magical things with potatoes at Au Cheval.Finally we come to the burger.  First, order a single since that is actually a double and get bacon and egg on it.  I can't really describe the euphoria when eating this thing.  At times it doesn't even taste like a burger, it transcends the pitiful conception of what a burger can be.  By the way even the bun is perfect, being akin to brioche but thick and durable, able to withstand the full weight of the meaty insides.  Still as good as it is, half of a double with all the fixings was enough for me.  Au Cheval is just too rich at times.  I was glad that we added a side of their delicious sweet pickles to cut into the savory flavors threatening to overwhelm us.I recommend everyone come here for a burger at least once, it is worth the hefty restaurant price.  But I find it hard to give it five stars since I don't feel an urge to go here often."
"10.30pm on a Sunday evening and I am trying to find a place to eat on Randolph, its turning out to be a nightmare. Girl and the Goat is full and their bar is packed. G.E.B. looks dead with one table inside there and it didn't look too inviting. Nellcote blantly didn't want our business so that they could close and get out of there. After bounching around all these other restaurants, we decided on Au Cheval.We were greeted just inside the door by one of the friendliest hosts in Chicago. I didn't catch her name but she had bleached blonde hair and glasses and got our group seated asap. We were seated in the back where they seemed to be a mini ""Top Chef Season Texas"" reunion as 3 of the contestants were back there just hanging out. Au Cheval is dark and is very much a late night hang out. The food is big and filling, maybe not the healthiest but really good. The greens salad was basic but tasty but the Cheeseburger was the best in Chicago. I wish I had taken a photo but I had the burger torn apart before that was possible. We also had the Gunthrop Chicken which was very good but not in the same league as the Cheeseburger.I really like this place and I will be back. I would love them to update their website and make it a bit more user friendly with more details but Au Cheval is worth a visit."
Great staff very knowledgable and polite. Drink we're great. Food was good however my husband and I got food poisoning. I'm sure it was a fluke thing and by no means the norm just make sure things  are cooked thoroughly.
"Ambiance is just right, here.  The restaurant is the perfect size - an intimate space - and a much needed detour from certain Chicago eateries that feel the need to feed everyone and their mammas all at once.  I also love the fact that Au Cheval doesn't take reservations.  This new wave of call-eight-years-in-advance-and-we-may-or-may-not-­pick-up-the phone-this-month business is out of effin' control.  Finally, a hip place where one can just roll on in and be seated.  How novel!  I ordered the delicious triple blue cheese omelet with the wonderful mixed greens salad (oh, what a remarkable dressing can do to some otherwise boring greens!) and both were perfect.  Others in my party ordered the (beef?) stew and fried/crispy chicken dishes and seemed to be happy campers at the end of their meals.My only gripe, however, is that this place has certainly hopped aboard the look-how-much-meat-we-can-pack-into-this-menu train of late, where even the most unsuspecting side dishes are bathed in some sort of meat fat.  I'm pretty sure that the salad, the bread and butter pickles, and the smashed potatoes were the only sides that were not harboring some sort of meat fat.   The food that my friends ordered was exceptionally heavy and, to be honest, they were a bit wrecked for hanging out afterwards.  Anyhow, I'm sure that if they had just ordered a digestif (that were, in fact, offered after dinner), they would have been a lot less sluggish.In sum, if you're looking for a light bite, Au Cheval is not the place.  If you're really hungry, it seems to be a great choice, provided that you're up for a meal that is heavy on the meat and that will likely keep your belly busy for the rest of the evening."
"Wow, the fried chicken is AMAZING."
"The newest Shining Star on Randolph St.Cool music, a well trained and knowledgeable staff, interesting menu, decent prices and a great atmosphere.My favorite - General Jane's chicken, Beef stew, double Cheese burger, roasted bone marrow, and fantastic crispy fries topped with a fried egg!I've been here twice and I need to get another fix from this place soon."
"Have been here twice and absolutely love the food. I've only been here twice because I feel twice a year is about as often as I can go, without risking almost certain heart failure. The menu doesn't pull any punches - with the exception of maybe 1-2 items, it is an   unapologetically rich, decadent, over the top selection of items that are super  delicious. Vegetarians - do not bother coming here. Pretty much everything, including several of the vegetables, has meat in it. If you go here, you will just end up writing a whiny review about why they don't cater to vegetarians. If you want to eat a meal where you feel like you're at a diner run by Paula Deen if she studied under Alain Ducasse, and have about 2 hours to spare for a nap afterwards - go and enjoy yourself."
"I love this place so much I went twice in one week.The place is an upscale diner, the decor is intimate and the food is AMAZING.  There are not enough words.  The menu is eclectic, not for the timid!  We had the Crispy Potato Hash with duck heart gravy, General Tso's Fried Chicken, and the Crispy Fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli & fried farm egg.  Yum Yum Yum.  I had the Salmon the second time.  YUM YUM YUM.  A welcome addition to the neighborhood!  If you are worried about your cholesterol, bring your Lipitor!"
Top notch across the board. Burgers are spot on. You gotta time it right so you don't have a long wait but it is worth the wait. The pickle back shot is delicious. Who would have thought about pairing whiskey and pickle brine?
"A place like this belongs in a neighborhood and not in the midst of fine dining. This is the kind of place you want to stop by on the way home from work for a burger and a beer. And the burgers, damn, possibly the 2nd best in the city. That joint down the street, Burger Barn or whatever it's called is no competition for the burgers here. The other grub ain't bad, either. I'd say we sampled half the menu and the only thing worth remembering is the bologna sandwich and those burgers.I can't get over the ludicrous beer prices and portions though. Many of the finer beers are $12+ for only 8 ounces. These aren't exclusive beers either, you can get them at most bars with a decent selection.Still, I'd go back for the burgers. Wow."
This place is bar food but slightly elevated. it is a very small place. If you go at peak times expect 1.5-3 hour wait
"Loved this place! Although it is small and we took a seat at the counter to avoid a 2 hour wait... it was worth it. I actually loved sitting at the counter since all of the prep work and cooking is done in front of you there. The food is diner/american style with a twist. We had the fries with a fried egg on top and although it sounds funny this dish was amazing paired with the garlic aioli!I can't wait to go back to this place since the food was great, atmosphere was trendy but laid back and were in and out in an hour on a Saturday night which was impressive."
SERIOUSLY good food.  If you like rich flavors and a splash of creative combinations along side some classics then this place is a must do.Make sure to bring your appetite.  Sharing a bunch of dishes tapas style works a treat - if you don't have the luxury of living close enough to come back and work your way through the menu (which if I lived in Chicago I would definitely do).Well done Au Cheval!
I haven't had one thing that was a miss here.
"Good beers. Great burgers. AMAZING fries. Another Sodikoff hit. Gets slammed at peak times, and there's not really anywhere to wait, so if you aren't up for standing awkwardly around trying to stay out of the way of the servers, go when it's slower. Love that a server took our drink orders while we were standing b/c we couldn't get to the bar. Worked out for us AND the peeps sitting/eating at the bar who wouldn't want us shouting out orders over their heads anyway."
"Deeee-licious!!! So the name made me wonder if it were equestrian themed, but oh no! Hipster, foodie heaven!!!! Biggest matzoh ball in the world! The bacon? No no. That was JUICY smoked pork belly. I mean, shut the front door!!!! The sticky delicious Asian inspired hoisin fried chicken with 2 hot towels-- perfection!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Strange brew drink is pretty good.  We started with the bone marrow, bacon, duck fat hash, all really good.  My bf had the burger, which he really liked.  I went with the bologna sandwich, which I prob wouldn't get again.  Very salty.  Love the music, great atmosphere"
"Service was great! I sat at the bar and ordered foie gras with scrambled eggs and toast. It was delicious, flavorful and super rich. It held its own when paired with the Italian barberra I ordered. Great atmosphere, liked the background music. Definitely a great experience!"
"you know what..to be straight up honesti am SO DISAPPOINTED. in the foodor in the burger* specificallyhearing awesome raving reviews (including that of my friends)i was fairly excited (but not too hyped up) about their burgeri order one with an eggwhen it cameit looked like a decent size although it was pretty pricey coming out to be around $13 or sobut you know what, i am willing to spend on something that is worth itbut i was SO SAD.because the meat didn't taste like much at allsauce had good taste, but i couldnt taste the meat that muchfried egg was the best partand the side pickle.. which is always such a good compliment to a sandwich or a burgeryumyummmbut yeah.. fries also didnt come with it but my friend ordered somethey werent that goodand too saltybut the sauce they came with was definitely goodanyhow back to the burgerit was messy but i dont mind it being messyonlyTHE MEATWHY WAS THE MEAT NOT TASTY NOR WAS IT MEAT TEXTUREIT WAS KINDA SOFT/SOGGYSIGHbutanywaysthis place is decent because of the decor and how everything looksits cute and has a nice vibe/atmospherehost/servers really know how to make their customers comfortable as they are just the right amount of friendlyonly other complaint would bethe wait.. well not really too badsince we went out shopping in that timebut the fact that there was a line in the restaurant which isnt very bigit gets crowded..my friends and i were in a booth next to the door and there were people right next to our table waiting in line they were in bumping distance.alsoa bit too loud for my likingwe couldnt hear each other talking"
"I had a great experience at Au Cheval.  I went with a group of 4 at 6PM on a Saturday and there was no wait.  We were seated in a booth, which was really comfortable.  Our server was great and she really allowed us to pace ourselves.  We actually ordered one thing at a time and she didn't seem to mind at all.  We got the chicken livers, the salmon special, a single cheeseburger, the fries with the egg and mornay sauce,  the vegetable salad, matzo ball soup, and a root beer float.For the appetizer type dishes, we really preferred the salmon over the chicken livers, but both were good.  The salmon had smoked salmon and regular salmon diced up with what looked like a mayo based dressing to bind it all together.  The chicken livers were also diced up, and while they were fine, they didn't knock my socks off.What was completely amazing was the burger.  We ordered the single cheeseburger with the sauce on the side with no bacon or egg.   I think this is the perfect way to get it.  The sauce on the side, which we tasted, was pretty salty, and I think it would have overpowered the burger taste.  Without it, it was one of the best burgers I have ever had, definitely up there with Kuma's or Hot Chocolate.  The fries were really good, but I thought the egg and mornay sauce were superfluous.  I would just go with the straight fries with the aioli sauce next time.  We were planning on getting the fried chicken for the table, but we didn't want to be too stuffed.  We ended up getting the vegetable salad, which was fresh and a nice contrast to everything, and the matzo ball soup.  I really liked the soup, it was also a nice lighter choice and the matzo ball (which was the biggest I have ever seen) was really fluffy and light. Another incredible part of the meal was the root beer float.  Unbelievable!  It has Black Dog gelato malted vanilla ice cream and amazing root beer.  It was really fun for the whole table to split too.One other thing, my friend got an old fashioned and it was a seriously beautiful drink to look at and tasted awesome.The music was varied (ranged from straight up late 90s to big band), and it was loud when we first arrived, but I noticed when more people came in the restaurant, the sound was absorbed so the volume got better and better.  So, long story short, it seems like the music is up high because once a bunch of people are in the restaurant then you really can't hear it.Overall, a fun, laid back and satisfying experience.  I will be back.  I also love that they serve food late night.  More places should do that!"
"Warned about excessive wait time from previous reviews, I assumed early arrival for Friday dinner was mandatory, which, is why I made an effort to arrive at Au Cheval at 6 pm. I was not going to allow hunger pangs to last for an inpatient hour while pending a table. However, I suppose causations of a rainy evening either held people back in traffic or the stars collided and luck was on my side; there was absolutely NO WAIT! :) Upon entering Au Cheval a Worker on break smoking a cigarette ordered a Regular Customer to be a gentleman and told him to hold the door open for me, before the Regular was to engage in a colloquial conversation with him. The importance of this tale lies in breaking the stereotype of pretentious regulars and service from the surrounding Randolf area and Au Cheval itself. I was grateful for the chivalry by both men.  Waiting for my guest to arrive, I was given a full menu, ushered to stand along the bar, and assured that a wait staff member would be with me shortly to take my order. The host offered to put my coat in coach check and I handed her my belongings. I was pleased with this service because trying to take care of an all white coat can be tolling, but the staff was sensitive to my needs. When it was time to take my drink order, the waitress was friendly and knowledgeable in helping me pick out one of Au Cheval's 30+ beers. She told me she had already tried all the drinks on the menu and in my opinion, articulated the few I inquired about in a helpful and descriptive manner. She knew her beers well! Fuzzy on remembering the name of the beer, I choose a lager at only 4.5% alcohol. The light lager taste suited well as a starter.My guest and I were seated shortly after I ordered my beverage at a round table nearest the restroom and towards the end of the bar area. I ordered Au Cheval's select prepared fish, which was salmon for the evening and my guest ordered a cheeseburger. The salmon was exquisite and the price reasonable. However, next time I find myself at Au Cheval I would like to try something different. My guest enjoyed the cheeseburger topped with a fried egg. For dessert, I only glanced at the menu but the list was more than bountiful. Already full from having dinner, my guest and I settled for one last drink. My guest ordered a dark beer and I a champagne and absinth. The only thing to be critiqued negatively, is the necessity to order a side dish per entre. I found myself wanting a side of vegetables along with the salmon and wondering why fries didn't accompany the cheeseburger. I assume it's Au Cheval's incentive to order a costly small side dish as a means to gain a higher profit. Overall, the ambiance of a dim, vintage, upscale diner, held true to Au Cheval's French motif. I found myself pleased with the uppity and trendy music that was playing. The menu accommodates a frugal budget as well as extravagant with a vast selection of entres. Service was on point! Au Cheval made for a great new ""Foodie"" endeavor, by which, I give my experience 4 stars!"
"Our party of 3 arrived here around 6:30 on Thursday and were fortunate enough to snag the last open booth.  Shortly after, the wait started to build quickly, and there doesn't really seem like there is much space for those people to stand when the bar is full.The drink list is pretty spectacular (cocktails, drafts, and beer bottles), which isn't surprising seeing that this is coming from the people behind Gilt Bar and Maude's Liquor Bar. Ranking our meal from most favorite to least favorite item: Double Cheese Burger, Griddled Bratwurst, Toasted Open-Faced Ham & Cheese Fondue, General Tso's Fried Chicken.  We liked both our sides -Crispy Fries and Bread & Butter Pickles.All in all, the atmosphere and drinks were excellent, the food - good not great, and the service lacking. Oh yeah, and make sure to bring some Tums for dessert (needless to say, the food is rich)."
"Just ordered the burger W/ egg and yes it was what everyone says it is redic. Small place a little loud but as you sit at the bar and look around you find your self nodding your head and liking it food is being prepared right in front of you non stop(bar seating, they do have booths as well) so you end making choices for your next visit before you even get your food lol. Will be returning for the chilaquiles and honey fried chicken. can not wait!"
"First of all, I never give 5 stars. Second, I will say that the 5 stars is for our experience, which consisted of two amazing burgers and two amazing bloody mary's. We did not try anything else but I am convinced that these alone are worthy of the review. The place is way too cool. The music is on tape reels, yes tape reels. way too cool. . I had heard about the burger and the server confirmed that it had a reputation, even international acclaim!  I was skeptical but quickly believed them when I tasted the open faced burger, with layers of cheese, and a perfectly cooked egg on it. It's not just about the egg, it's the perfect cooking of everything, and the layout, and the bread that doesn't fall apart once the open face is closed (remarkable really because the thing is just so juicy). The bloody mary was the best I've had, with enough vegetable and pickle to consider two of them my daily serving of vegetable. The hash browns were also amazing, not quite sure how they do it, but I figure it's best not to ask. My experience in Chicago has been that the service and attitude is far superior to other cities, particularly SF, and Au Cheval is no exception. The hostess was absurdly friendly, remembering names, checking in on us, and giving more recommendations for other restaurants. I noticed a strange habit of over-quoting the wait which while I understand is a helpful marketing ploy, it's actually quite annoying because you can't plan your wait accordingly. Twice we were told it would be an hour +, and we got the text 10 minutes later, which was a little chaotic slamming our $15 cocktails down the street. I found that every restaurant in this neighborhood did the same thing over the four days we ate our way through this city."
"My nephew & I checked out this place for brunch, after being told of the hour+ wait at the Little Goat. Not a bad substitution at all. No matter what else you order here, you simply MUST try the Foie Gras & Scrambled Eggs. 5-star worthy, all on its own. We also split the Crispy Potato Hash with Duck Heart Gravy. Pretty tasty, also...but not ""want-to-lick-the-plate-it's-so-good"" tasty like the Foie Gras Eggs. On our next visit, we want to try the Fried House-Made Bologna Sandwich. Believe me, from what we saw at neighboring tables, this is not the Oscar Mayer Bologna on Wonder Bread that you remember from your childhood! Overall, 5-stars for the Foie Gras Scrambled Eggs...4-stars for the Crispy Potato Hash with Duck Heart Gravy...3-stars for service. (Our server, Ryan, was super sweet....but service was painfully slow....and our order was mixed up....we waited an hour for our 2nd entrée to arrive.) So, do yourself a favor and check this place out...pretty sure you'll like it!"
"Last night's gluttony is still triggering violent heart palpitations, as the foie and egg grease coating my arteries is enough to clog a Roomba. Regardless, I'm in lust with Au Cheval.Finally a place that caters to functioning alchys, leading its cocktail menu with a blunt list of ""strong drinks."" This includes an Old Fashioned stiffie that implores you to make bad decisions like ordering the aforementioned foie and scrambled eggs, the tastiest one way ticket to heart disease. The chopped chicken liver salad, topped with a dollop of salted butter, is somehow the menu's healthiest option. While it looks like it may be served in Roseanne's loose meat sandwich joint, it's much more divine. And that burger...it's classic, damn delicious and the culprit for why you'll soon find me shopping at Lane Bryant. And because I""ll be bitter about that, it's also the only irrational reason this place gets jipped out of 5 stars."
"hipster snobs.  food is just okay, small place."
"Since my last review of Au Cheval I have been back twice.  In my last three star review I had said that while the service was horrible and the food was good (not great), I would be back to try the chilaquiles after midnight as the ambiance is fantastic and so is the draft list.  So that is what I did, I went back to Au Cheval to try the chilaquiles at midnight, well at least that is what I tried to do!  It took me a couple visits...On the second visit we got there around 11:00pm.  We had to wait until 12:00am to order the chilaquiles, but we were hungry so we decided to order some food to share in the meantime.  We ordered fries and a cheeseburger, which are some of the items we had during our first visit, but we decided to try them again.  I'm sure glad that we did decide to give these items a second try, because they were much better!  The fries were crispier and the egg on top of them was cooked perfectly.  With the cheeseburger, we didn't order the egg and bacon the first time we tried it and that was a mistake.  I would advise anyone getting the cheeseburger to get all of the toppings offered, including the bacon and eggs, as all of the toppings really do make the cheeseburger.  I'm not even that big of a bacon fan (I know, what a sin!), but I really enjoyed the way it was cooked and how it complimented the cheeseburger.  If you are a topping whore like I am then you will very much enjoy the cheeseburger at Au Cheval.  After we ate our ""in the meantime"" food, we saw an order of the chilaquiles going to another table and we realized it was far too big for our full stomachs.  So we decided to, yet again, come back another night to try them.  Another note about our second visit is that our server was delightful!  She was, as my partner stated, ""a stark contrast compared to the server that we had on our first visit to Au Cheval.""  We even told her this and while she didn't need to be apologetic, she was.  Finally, on our third visit, we tried the chilaquiles!  We were sat at the bar and unfortunately we had the same unhappy server that we had our first visit.  It turns out that she wasn't just having a bad night that first time she served us and she really is just a rude person.  We ignored her rudeness as we did the first time, enjoyed our delicious beers and waited for the chilaquiles we ordered.  They arrived after about 15 minutes and they sat in front of us for a good minute as we stared at the massive cast iron dish filled with tortilla chips, sour cream, guacamole, scrambled eggs, onions, chihuaha cheese, salsa, jalapenos, and cilantro!  It looked so delicious and as we took our first couple bites we realized the looks of the dish reflected the taste as well.  Everything tasted so well together.  My favorite parts of the dish were the perfectly fluffy eggs and the sweet flavor of the onions.  I have become a fan of Au Cheval, but it's unfortunate that they have a problem with the face of their restaurant.  Out of three visits, our service was only good one time.  I've heard from multiple friends that they wouldn't go back, because the service was so bad.  Hopefully they can work this problem out as everything else is very enjoyable.  My rating is going up a whole star, because the food tasted a whole start better and as I said before, the ambiance and draft list are both great!"
"Excited to try this place, I walked in for Sunday brunch with 5 of my girlfriends. This place is very small, but regardless, we made our way to the hostess table. Eager to put my name in for a table, I was quickly told by the hostess that they were done taking reservations for the day. Did I mention it was 1:30 pm on a Sunday? I then proceeded to go to the bar for a drink and was told I could not stand at the bar, because they needed that area to be clear for the servers to get through. Um, excuse me, but isn't the point of having a bar, to have people at it?  We were told we could go into a tiny little crowded corner, towards the front, if we wanted to have a drink at the bar. Sorry, Au Cheval, you were a very big disappointment and not sure I will be returning. Maybe you should better be better prepared to accommodate your guests next time."
"Came here for some late night nosh with new friends after a cocktail reception.  It was late and dark, we randomly chose an assortment of plates, shared and licked the plates clean.  Really remarkable hearty food.  And I don't even remember what it was we had exactly. There was a matzo ball soup, a duck heart hash, a fried bologna sandwich and on and on.  After one too many pinot noirs, I just know I loved everything and it was perfect for soaking up a little alcohol in a way I had heretofore reserved for late night gyros and burgers.  I will never be able to go back to my old ways.  I've been ruined for gyros forever.   Really an enjoyable experience."
Great atmosphere up in here. The wait staff is always on their game. Best burger in town. Order a double cheeseburger with bacon and fried egg with a side of fries. This will blow your mind. Root beer float for dessert too.
"I'm torn. The food here is pretty good, the service not so much. I've been here multiple times for brunch and dinner and it's consistently busy but the hosts are just not nice. I've been a hostess in a restaurant before-admittedly not as popular a place- and I know hangry people can be super hangry but still. I felt like I was trying to get into a pretentious club in the meat packing district in NYC on a Saturday night. and this is for brunch at au cheval. I love good food but the first interaction when you walk in the door can leave a bad taste in your mouth for the rest of the meal. However this last time we had a charming server who convinced us to start w a blueberry muffin- Whooa nelly I needed some insulin after this one-the muffin is cut in half and grilled in butterrrrr. And thenthentheygiveyoumorebutter!!  There is a chocolate sauce too. But wowzers. So many times I've been and missed the chilaquiles but this past time I got em- pretty darn good but not the best I've had. I complain about this place but if the group wants to go back u know I'll be there."
"These guys are just a little too into themselves. There are too many great places to dine on randolph to have a cocky attitude, and I find their staff to be a little self absorbed with a hint of condescension. For whatever reason, I usually feel like a tourist in this place. At any rate, the burger really is good, and they have an asian chicken dish that's really great. It's a tad on the pricy side for what you get. I continue to go back because my friends love this place, but there are certainly better options where I feel my patronage is more appreciated."
"From the same owners as Gilt Bar, which is possibly my FAVORITE place to take friends in town, I was excited to come to Au Cheval and we were NOT disappointed!The birthday party happened a while ago so I don't quite remember the details. I will have to say that we received some AMAZING service and dear waiter - we were horrible and I was half drunk, I should have given you way WAY more tip given how much we ate but my calculator was a little too accurate.Okay, what did we get?Foie gras and pork-stuffed cabbage or something similar to that. Don't ask it, jus tget it!Single Cheese BurgerKosher Dill PicklesPork Porter House omg it was the craziest biggest THING we all ate (table of 6)Griddled BratwurstCome to think of it we must have ordered one of almost everything on the menu. If you love heart-stopping meat this is the place to go!"
"So, I'll start by saying I tend to discount reviews that complain about the service.   I understand that great service is a part of the experience, but my focus is generally the quality of the food more than anything else.  That being said, I had great service on a Sunday evening at 7pm.  No problems at all.  Waited about 15 minutes to be seated as a group of 3 people, but the wait staff took our drink order while we were waiting, which was nice.  Had the Pegu Club drink which was fantastic, as well as the Dupont seasonal beer, also amazing.  Had the single burger (which is actually two patties) with the fried egg and bacon and it was absolutely absolutely divine.  They did not offer the option of how it should be cooked (I generally like medium rare), but this was by no means overdone.  For me, this is a top 5 burger contender.  I'm hesitant to be superlative (although I do generally feel like Kuma's IS the best) but really this burger is worth a try.  What was just as striking for me was the music: relatively mellow hip hop on a reel to reel analog deck.  It was awesome.Fries were quite tasty.  Didn't try anything else on the menu, but was really happy with this place."
"Food is great but very hard to get a table as they do not take reservations and the place is tiny. And the area to wait for your table to be called is very tight. Based on the attitude of the hostesses in communicating the ""no table"" message I would give them no stars (I get that they don't have a table after we drove across the city and paid for parking but I definitely don't need to be insulted in addition to disappointed), one maybe two stars for the wait and annoyance with the whole limited space situation and four for the food, so overall, two stars."
"This is really 4.5 stars. The only reason I didn't give it 5 is because if I can't hear my waitress because the music is so loud, that's not good. I'm all about music but just turn it down a tiny bit.This food was amazing! First off the fries were delicious. They come with a garlic aioli, which I could not stop eating because it was fantastic. They are also served with an egg on top. In fact almost everything is served with an egg on top, which works with every dish we had. Please get the fries if you go. We also tried the side of bacon, which is think cut and flavorful, but I don't need to have it again. I went with the ham and cheese fondue. It really is a dish of ham and cheese fondue served with toast for dipping and it's very good and filling. My husband ordered the friend bologna sandwich. I know, why would you go out for a bologna sandwich? It was very tasty and had a large amount of bologna on it. We also tried a friend's hamburger which was also very tasty.We will be back. There are several other items I want to try, hopefully soon!"
"We came here with friends from Chicago. The wait was a bit long but it was worth it. Our friend said the burger was gonna kick me in my ""mouth hole"" and it did!! Some people like it with the egg, I got mine with bacon and it was good! There is this salad that has apple, blue cheese, and a variety of veggies. I cant remember what it was called but it was tasty! We will be coming back next visit to Chicago!!"
"One of my favorite places in the city;  diverse selection of craft beers; very professional and friendly staff; try everything on the menu; I suggest you split the burger with someone, it is a monster; it gets packed and then you have to stand in a small spot close to the door but it is well worth the wait."
"Amazeballs.  Bon Appetite named Au Cheval has having the best burger.  I don't know if they're correct.  I'd put it tied as #1 with Diner in Brooklyn, NY.  Two different styles of burgers.  I went to Au Cheval for brunch and went all out by getting both the fried egg and bacon on my burger.  As much of a guilty pleasure that was, I will have to try the burger without the egg/bacon in order to better judge how good the burger REALLY is.  It is juicy, greasy, and tasty.  The hash brown here are the BEST hash browns EVER.  It is the tastier more refined version of a McDonald's hash brown.  We also got the scrambled eggs with foie gras which is way overkill, but heaven in my mouth.  I would never be able to finish an order on my own because it is so damn rich.  If the wait wasn't always so long at Au Cheval, I'd be back again and again for the burger and hash browns."
"Holy crap do I feel fat this morning. I blame Au Cheval...and my inability to leave a single egg-covered fry on the plate. Fantastic beers, great burgers (with an egg...because everything is better with an egg on top)...Loved the raw vegetable salad (as opposed to the cooked salad??)...nice waitress, on point service, cool vibe.The music was perfectly mixed, too...I'd definitely go back!"
"Words cannot describe this place. Everything our group ordered was delicious! Service was quick and friendly, the restaurant has a great atmosphere and the drink selection is perfect. Great beers, great non-alcoholic drinks, and the burgers are to die for. I would highly recommend this place"
food      =   goodservice  =   goodmusic    =   AWESOME!!!Its worth the visit to listen to the endless downtempo that lingers somewhere between some kinda trip hop bidness and a song that you heard 20 years ago at an after party that blew your mind and never found out the name of it and never heard it again...go for the food - stay for the music.
"Awesomeness!  Yes that's a word, haha.  I really like this place.  The decor is so warm and inviting.  It's a small place, with a small menu but the food is damn good! The food comes out quick too.  This is my second time visiting and was not disappointed.Jane's Fried Chicken - Asian sweet and spicy sauced pieces of chicken sprinkled with cilantro.  Comes with 2 wings, 2 drumsticks, and 2 thighsBologna Sandwich - Yea, not the bologna you're used to.  Flat top fried, thin slices stacked high. So good!Fries with egg and Mornay sauce - Crispy and seasoned right.  A must have every visit.Bread and Butter pickles - $4 for a small bowl of sliced pickles with onions; well worth it!Mille Feuille - Layers of chocolaty,  flaky pastry and vanilla cream custard...tasted like heaven!  Looked heavy, but was really light.For sure a staple in my restaurant rotation.  An added plus is that everything on the menu is at a reasonable price."
"I'm not a beer drinker, and I may have been more impressed if I was because there is an extensive craft beer list. That said, the food is an eclectic mix for sure. Bologna sandwich, burgers, glazed sesame fried chicken, foie gras, french fries topped with a fried egg...Not at all typical 'diner' style preparation, though, all of the dishes done with inventive twists. Might be nice for a date, on the small, dark side overall, Ok service, no wait for an early weeknight dinner, not much in the way of deserts, which is very un-diner-like. I'm not dying to go back."
Yummmm! dark grungy and delicious!
"Wonderful Hemingway, terrific frites with aioli, and absolutely to die for ham and cheese fondue sandwich thing. Just a little crowded where we were sat, right by the bar to the left of the door. At one point we had to ask a man to kindly remove himself from our booth. Small price to pay overall."
"Sunday night meal in west loop, 3 of us total and we all shared each others meal.  Everything was amazing!!  Double Cheeseburger with egg, Bone marrow dish, and chicken. In addition we ordered fries with sauce and an egg on top.  Simply awesome, all of it.  We are all self proclaimed foodies and couldn't say enough about it."
Top 3 burger in Chicago.
"I call this place ""short order gourmet"" (think Waffle House except dark, intimate, energetic, and cozy all wrapped in one). The beer selection is one of the best in town.    I have been three times and have had the burger and fries, crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy, and the fried chicken -- all are stellar. Great atmosphere and music. Eat here. You will not regret it."
"Best meal we had in Chicago (and we went to some fabulous places)!!!Definitely get the following:1) Raw vegetable salad with apple and blue cheese2) Roasted marrow bones with beef cheek marmalade and toast3) General Jane's honey-fried chicken, and 4) Foie gras terrine with strawberry jamIt's a small restaurant so be prepared for a wait if you don't have reservations.  That said, we enjoyed eating at the bar...as we made new acquaintances and watched master craftsmen prepare the wonderful food."
"This place has, HANDS DOWN, the best burger in town! The fries are also killer, but you need to try this burger! Staff is friendly and attentive, the atmosphere is pleasant... all around, a great place to grab lunch."
"This is my first review since returning to my hometown of Chicago and I wish this could be a rave but due to the service I have to give this place only 3 stars (If I could I would do 2.5). I hope my experience is an anomaly but I feel compelled to share. We arrived around 6:50pm and were told that a wait for 2 people would be around 35 minutes. We happily cozied up to the bar and ordered drinks with the server that was walking around taking orders for those of us waiting for tables. The server asked if we wanted to stay at our seats at the bar or wait for our table. We decided to wait for our table, she said no problem and that our drinks would be transferred over to our table tab once we were seated and asked what name we had on the list. After an hour of waiting at the bar and noticing people who arrived after us being seated we inquired about our table. The host looked through her list and then pulled out a list from the garbage where our name was the only name not highlighted. Her next response was ""you are next."" Still willing to let this roll off our shoulders we were seated and greeted right away. We ordered another round of drinks and put in our food order right away. We ordered the bone marrow for an appetizer, the single burger with egg and bacon, and the honey crisp chicken. The food really was great. I would recommend all of the items to anyone trying this place out. The egg on the burger was perfect and the bacon was thick and delicious as it should be. The chicken was cooked to the perfect amount of crispiness without drying any of the meat out and the glaze was great. And for those who like Bone Marrow you will not be disappointed unless you are sharing then you may wish you had it all to yourself. After we ordered our food and it was brought out to us, we never saw our server again. We got our food around 8:50 and finished it in 10-15 minutes. Our dishes were cleared and our cocktail glasses taken away by the busser but our server never came to ask us about ordering dessert or additional drinks. He did serve all the tables around us and we were basically invisible for the next 40 minutes. We were not even sure if he was ever going to bring our bill. Finally, we decided to put our jackets on and see if that prompted any reaction from him. Three to four minutes later, our bill was slipped on our table without a word from our server. As I said, the food was great but the service left a bad taste in my mouth. To be forgotten first by the host table and then by our server does not make me want to rush back to Au Cheval. If either incident had been addressed by the staff whether that be the host table acknowledging their mistake or our server apologizing for not checking on us for 40 minutes I think I would have brushed off this incident. I am willing to give it another chance in the future but not anytime soon. The food and the atmosphere (great hip hop music playing) were the saving graces of this place."
"My experience here couldn't have been better. This me kept me happy for the rest of the day. I had the raw veg salad, roasted bone marrow, and the fried chicken. If I hadn't cleaned all my plates I might have had room for Mille feuille. Waitstaff was so nice, beer list is great, and obviously so is the food. They exceeded my expectations. Can't wait to go back!"
"Au Cheval is amazingly delicious. I love a lounge with good tunes and on top of that this place has the best burger, chopped salad and fires with gravy I've ever tasted. Prepare to wait or go super early!"
"Great burgers!! No frill, nice and juicy patty, done just right! mmmmmmmm. Now beware, this place is very tiny, half of the space within is the actual cooking kitchen. For a party of 4 we waited close to 1.5-2 hours for a seats at the bar. We wanted to try a variety of things so we had the bone marrow, burgers, and fries, and their dessert of  multi layered cake. We were sitting at the bar so we got to see how the food was prepared and it was just really different than any other restaurant I was at. There were coat hooks right underneath the bar to hang our coats. Our waiter did not seem to like us too much though because we weren't drinking as we had our drinks at little goat the hour before we got our seats at Au Cheval and wasn't ordering as much as other parties. In the end I felt like she was trying to rush us out quite a bit but the food was good enough that I would be willing to deal with that type of service to come back."
"The burger is everything its cracked up to be.  We sat at the counter and were told by one of the line chefs to get the single cheeseburger plain - don't add bacon or an egg.  We followed instructions and it didn't disappoint.  Bf thinks its top three best burgers in the city, I think its hands down the best. Just as amazing was the service.  We weren't thrilled about sitting at the counter but went with it just to avoid the wait.  Turned out to be a fantastic idea.  Rootbeer on tap is stellar, as was the craft beer list.  Can't wait to return!"
"Knowing they don't take reservations we arrived at 6ish, hoping not too wait too long and we didn't. The place is a lot smaller than expected, with probably only 15 tables plus the bar. We were sat at end of the bar, with a great view to see everything being made, like the host said, the best seats in the house. Everything is made before your eyes in the open kitchen, and at the bar, they showcase an impressive 30+ international beers on tap and some tempting specialty cocktails. For the food, per all the reviews you see on Yelp, Google and Urbanspoon - this place is not for those who prefer a salad with dressing on the side.The menu consists of just two salads (initially I was tempted, but later thought I can't come here an order salad), burgers, a steak or two, a few items with eggs and lots of Fois Gras accompaniments.  At a glance I wasn't too excited about the menu, as I am not a huge Fois Gras fan (even this really good stuff).However we ended up ordering the fries with Morney sauce, garlic aloli and a fried egg, it was so amazing. Then we shared the omelet special, which had a terrific blue cheese of which I don't remember the name, we also had a single burger (which actually has a double patty).  The menu doesn't tell you the type of cheese, the garnishes, or anything else to let you know what to expect, nor were we asked how we wanted it cooked. Nonetheless, it came out perfect (medium rare) and delicious, so that works!More on my blog at: blondeswithappetite.com/…"
"Nom nom nom. Went here with a party of 5, waited 45 minutes for a table, and crammed into a booth to eat our food. We ate family style: 1 sesame chicken plate, 1 bratwurst plate, 1 crispy fries with egg plate, 2 cheeseburgers, and a side of the thick cut bacon. The sesame chicken was delicious - it came out hot and sooo crispy, and the sauce was bomb. The bratwurst was MEH, but the mashed potatoes underneath was heaven. The crispy fries were just okay, but the garlic aioli dipping sauce could have been a freaking drink for all I care it was so dang good. The bacon was okay, they were cooked perfectly and really thick cut. The cheeseburgers were supposed to be the star of the show (I believe they won 'Best Burger' in Bon Appetite magazine or something). They were nice, juicy, and very flavorful. We got the burgers topped with an egg and bacon - can never go wrong there. All in all, I was not disappointed with this ""Gourmet Diner"" food."
I consider myself a burger snob... This place has one of the best I've ever had. You'll wait for a table but they'll make it worth it!
Everything from the service to the food was spot on. Best hashbrowns I've probably ever had and the best burger in a long time...add the eggs/bacon and you'll be happy you did. Definitely will be back!
I've been here for dinner a few times. The food is outstanding but the lines are not well managed. The whole place isn't set up very well for the amount of people it attracts. Inside the restaurant is a very cool atmosphere. The old school stereo system is awesome to see. The cocktails are good and strong. It's a great place to bring a date but not a good place for a group. It may be alright for a table of four but not much more than that unless you are prepared to wait.
"After hearing a lot of hype about the place, me & my lady decided to check it out on a Saturday night.  Let's just say it was worth the hype.I'm a fan of an intimate dining experience, this is exactly that.  If you don't like dim restaurants & good music, this place isn't for you.  The food was PHENOMENAL.I had the General Jane's chicken while the girlfriend had a salmon dish.  We also shared a side of fries that came with a garlic type sauce that complimented the fries excellently. Last but not least, the beer selection is pretty dope too.  All you need to know is, that if you were thinking about coming here, stop thinking. Just do it."
"Oh my gawd...can it get any better than this?  My first experience at Au Cheval was tremendous!  It's a small, tight bar-bistro (more on that in a bit) and it's gotta be the most popular spot in the city behind Hot Dougs.  We went there on a Wednesday...got there about 7:00, it was crowded but not packed.  Found a corner of the beautiful zinc bar to hang at (it's impossible to stay out of everyone's way, but the service staff is pretty understanding about the crowding)  Got drinks immediately from a pleasant young server dude, ordered the ""Vieux Bonal"", a fantastic combo of rye whiskey, cognac and Bonal gentian liquer...man, I sucked that down fast, I'm a be makin' them at home this summer.  The craft cocktail menu isn't huge, but has something for most every drinker; they've got a fantastic beer collection on tap, and our server knew all about them and was able to suggest delicious beers for everyone in our group.  We were seated, and just in time, as the place became more and more crowded the later it got.  Here's where I downgrade Au Cheval one star - it's almost impossible for them to serve a party larger than four.  We had 5 in our group, and had to wait for one of the two booths at the end of the space where they'll put a barstool at the end of the tables.  So be forewarned, it you've got a large group, you're going to have to split up, or just keep taking over barstools until you're all sitting...Back to the food.  We ordered several items and shared family style, which they understand here.  Got the chopped salad with a soft-fried egg and a hunk of their delicious bacon (you'll see those words again!), dressed with a dilly ranch dressing.  Fab!  We ordered the fish of the day, a salmon that was cooked a perfect medium-rare.  The double burger with bacon was one of the best burgers I have EVER had - beefy, crispy edged patties, fabulous cheese to meat ratio, and more of that bacon!  We got an order of the fried chicken, and it was simply fantastic!  The sauce is as good as everyone else has said here - spicy, sweet tart, piquant, and perfectly applied.  But the star of the show was the bone marrow with beef cheek marmalade...a huge shin bone split lengthwise and roasted with salt pepper and spices, served with delicious greek-style toast and the to-die-for beefy sweet compote on the side...simply one of the best marrow presentations I've ever had.  And to finish off our culinary bacchanalia, we had an order of the crispy french fries with mornay sauce AND garlic aioli, with a fried egg on top...oh, yes, and another side of their bacon.  This restaurant truly understands that everything, yes EVERYTHING, is better with bacon.Presentation of the food was gorgeous, with lots of herby greens to munch on and sop up excess sauce (the cilantro was great to dip into the chicken sauce...).  Service was wonderful, attentive but not bothersome, and our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and the beer selection.  They play a fabulous mix of downtempo, old soul, trance, house and hiphop from a Teac 3300 open reel tapedeck with 10.5 inch reels, a thing of beauty to this old tech geek!  Like I said, it's busy, crowded (especially later), and won't handle a large party very well, but as a place for a double-date, it can't be beat!  Go!  These guys know what they're doing, food and drink wise!"
"I was with a group of 5 last night around 9, and we waited for about 2 hours to get a table (totally expected for a Saturday). When we were finally seated, our waitress, Danielle, was cold and unfriendly. Maybe she was having a bad night, but I felt like it was being taken out on us and my experience was effectively ruined from the start. The food was good, but her poor attitude left the bigger impression."
"I finally got to taste the famous cheese burger at Au Cheval and needless to say I was completely disappointed. I just wasn't that impressed and felt the place was a bit overpriced. Also, now I am never one to judge others, but if you aren't a hipster you better feel comfortable in your own skin, because you will be a minority. I am glad I went because my company was fantastic, but I cannot say I will ever go again...it just isn't worth it."
"This is my least favorite of all of the Sodikoff offerings, and the last one I tried.  The husband was wanting to try this place out on someone's recommendation, so we got there VERY early (11:05) and scored a booth.  Shockingly, there were already 5 other tables in there, and they only opened five minutes before that!  I ordered the fried bologna - having grown up on the dish from an old-school european grandfather making it in a cast iron skillet.  This is nothing close to what I was used to.  Thankfully I asked if anything was on it, so I avoided the dijonnaise (I just personally hate mustard - no qualms with them putting it on here in general)  The meat is thinly shaved, which misses the whole point of a fried bologna sandwich (it should be thick-cut and seared in the pan....)  The sharp cheddar is melted on it and, naturally, creates an oily residue that drips off.  Fries were good; served with a garlic aoili.  Husband had the double cheeseburger with thick cut bacon and a fried egg.  This should have been his heaven, but he said it was nothing special.  The thing was very hard to eat and he wasn't aware that there were diced red onions on it until I pointed it out, which then made him freak out (since he hates onions) for the rest of the meal.  We both agree that Dillman's is a far better lunch option and he even said ""if I had to wait more than 2 seconds to be seated, I wouldn't bother.""  Ouch."
"We just had THE BEST dinner at Au Cheval!!! The grilled cheese isn't on the menu, but it is great and comes with a pickle, just like daddy made back in the day. One of my dining campions got the cheese burger (single is two patties and double is three patties) with a fried egg and bacon and the other got the bratwurst both amazing! I started with green salad with sherry vinaigrette and it was heavenly.The music is loud but wonderful. While my parents would love the food, they wouldn't like the loud music, so just know this. We really put Shazam through a workout trying to find out the musicians playing.We didn't think the prices were awful. The grilled cheese was $7.50, the burger was about $10 and even the really foodie items like the bone marrow were under $20. The foie gras (sp?) police would go nuts with this menu, so if you like stuff you'll be in heaven!We'll definitely go back. I suggest arriving early since there are no reservations.Enjoy!"
"Went on saturday at noon with no expectations for wait time- a lovely morning and we wanted to have an enjoyable brunch. The greeting at the door by the hostess was lovely- 30 minute wait, or so and as we looked at each other to decide, however, her sidekick at the hostess station was the rudest individual I have ever met at a front station. What a shame- I hear the food is good Nd the service better?The front of staff needs work."
"At the suggestion of the Maude's staff (45 min wait and a full bar on Wednesday at 730), I ventured back to Au Cheval.  First of all, the draft beer selection is extensive.  Tonight they had a Mikkeller Pilsner on draft which was really fantastic - but they have about 30 other  offerings from noted breweries, so you will find one that you like.I was keeping it healthy, and ordered the green salad and salmon.  While both were very satisfying, sitting at the bar watching the burgers, chicken liver pate, bratwurst and fried chicken fly out of the kitchen led me to a level of regret on my choices. I also enjoyed the music - various genres but all funky - and the general vibe of the place - cool.  They are a late night dining spot, and I look forward to ending an evening at Au Cheval."
it was date night so we stopped by here and it was Awesome!I had the General Jane's chicken great!she had the Foie & scrambled eggs great!I totally recommend this place!! had a good time and food was great!
"Great food. Terrible wait time estimations; whatever they tell you add a good thirty minutes and then you might be in the ballpark. When they tell you 3 hours, just walk away. You'll thank me later when you're not hangry."
"I looooooove this place. It's truly a gem and my favorite place to eat. Anytime I have visitors from out of town, I love to take them here. Best excuse to eat here. The burger is the best ever. Must get it with bacon. The duck hash is rich and tastes like something your grandma would make if she was into duck hearts. Crispy fries with mornay sauce are sinful! Fried chicken is great! I love dark meat and it really hits the spot! There also some Salmon appetizer I had there recently that was quite lovely. If you can get egg on something, add the egg. House whiskey is cheap and good. Try it pickleback and you won't regret it. Can't wait to try the fried bologna and bone marrow for my bday dinner!"
"It's great for the most part, and the food is ridiculously good, but the past few times I've gone here the music is simply way too loud.  Hey Au Cheval--I love you but you're not a nightclub.  Dial it back 15% and the dining experience will be 10x more pleasant for everybody."
"Amazing burger. Cool spot, great service, little tight in some seats. Definitely check this place out."
Great beer selection. Got the au cheval burger after recommendation from Aziz Ansari. Girlfriend got a mexican themed dish I cannot recall but both were great. Fries were awesome. Would return for sure but the wait can be terrifying. Parking wasn't bad to find at the time. Service was so-so.
"Pretty good burgers but not amazing.  Smalllllll place, not good for a group.  Great beer selection. The bacon is really thick and salty, which I happen to be a fan of.  Fries are fantastic."
"What a great place!  The food was so good.  We, table of 4, tried about 6 things and shared everything.  Perfect place to do this!The people at the front were so nice and the wait staff were amazing!  Friendly,funny and very helpful!I will go back again and again!"
"I am a confirmed foodie who travels 100+ days\yr and thus I think I bring pretty good perspective and context to reviews - After 1 visit, I thought Au CHeval an outstanding place w unique and delicious food and top notch cocktails. - well worth the effort. To continue, you can get some unique things that stand out as alternative combinations of traditional ingredients. For example, I had the foie gras & pork-stuffed cabbage. While neither ingredient is something particularly out of place, the combination was outstanding and rich. As a result, this is a very good place for someone new to the food scene but who wants something unique but not so exotic as to be unrecognizable. Think midwest foodie comfort food.In addition,  Finally, outstanding cocktails (and from the list, good beer). That being said, this doesn't set them apart. Very good cocktails are becoming the norm not the exception and this place is a just a good example of that trend.Finally, on a solidly busy Thursday night, the staff and clientele were friendly and fun without being annoying. The people who work and visit clearly like food/drink and thus everyone beside you has a shared interest.The scene is busy without being chaotic and loud without being noisy; I would not come here on a peak night for a quiet relaxing dinner but that isn't the type of place they're trying to be.Well done Au Cheval."
"Absolutely amazing!!!  The best burger I've ever had, hands down. The garlic dipping sauce for the fries was SO good. Totally worth the 45 min wait for a table ( I've never said that ever. It's that good. )"
"Outstanding, upscale diner food delivered in a neatly appointed, albeit small, space. Great unique menu options to start with (suitable for sharing) and a burger that ranks way up on the list. I really enjoyed the service, particularly between apps and dinner when our server brought a toweled tray to our table and reset the table with fresh silverware. This struck me as a very nice 'extra' touch. One other extra touch worth noting, restroom had a higher quality non-institutional hand soap...smelled great and not something you'd typically see. Attention to small details like that from a restaurant can go a long way in enhancing the overall experience."
"I know this a trendy place, but I was disappointed.  It was noisy.  The menu choices are limited.  I got the chicken with the chili coating.  It was overlooked, and overpriced without any sides, not even bread.  The drinks are pricey, but nothing special. There are so many better places nearby."
"Ok, listen. We need to address the fact that Au Cheval thinks it is way too cool and charges an obscene amount of money for things, even by Chicago standards. $10 for  fries with an egg to tubs of dipping sauce (yes, yes I know they are ""mornay"" and ""aioli"", but please): I'd pay 7, maybe. A burger, which, while good, comes with nothing else for $12? Girl please, Holman and Finch in Atlanta, home to the ""third best burger in the country"" even gives you fries, and theirs is only $10. (P.S. it's better too.) $10 dollars for a bowl of ice cream? I mean, I yeah, it was good ""gelato"", but $10 is just a bit much. So perhaps they'll bring down their prices someday (jk), until then, I'll find some other gastropub to eat at, lord knows Chicago has plenty."
"Is this the best burger in Chicago? According to Bon Appetit it is and while I'm not sure one can really pick one burger to be the best, Au Cheval's burger is pretty dam good.I came here on a Sunday night at 6:30 and there was a 45 minute wait. Not too bad considering I have heard of 3 hour waits before. The 45 minute wait actually went by quickly as we grabbed a drink at the bar. They have a great drink selection and lots of beers on tap. We were eventually seated at the bar, which I totally recommend for being able to watch the chefs in action. It seemed that 75% of the orders were burgers, so of course we had to order the burger. Wow, oh wow this was really good. it is a thin patty, so the single is actually two patties and the ""double"" is three patties. Also make sure to get the bacon on top, it is super thick and flavorful, this might be the best bacon I've ever had! In addition to the burger, my boyfriend and I also tried the fried bologna sandwich. I'm not sure of the last time I had bologna (and honestly I would never say it was one of my favorite meats) but wow, this was an amazing sandwich! The bun, smokey homemade bologna and melted cheese made for a great combo.I will definitely be back to try brunch, and get that amazing burger again!"
"I live across the street and when Au Cheval first opened up they had gluten free bread and some gluten free options. Now the only thing I can have here is a simple prep salt&pepper fish. I told them that I lived here and that it would be awesome if they could cater to my gluten free needs as I would make them part of my weekly routine, the response was lackluster. Otherwise if you are a normal person I would say this place is awesome. All the other restaurants on this block, happily have gluten free options or changes they can make. All the other restaurants on my block realize that in a few years time they are doomed to go the way of Marche and that the people who are going to stick around are the people who live on your block."
"I have dreams about their burger. In fact, I haven't able to order any other entrees from their menu yet because I crave that burger! I have managed to try some sides and they have all been very good.Their pickle brine is also amazing. I highly suggest a round of picklebacks if you are in the mood to drink.Staff is always friendly and helpful. The line cooks are great to watch if you have the ability to sit at the bar."
"Great, great place. Cheeseburger was amazing, get the egg and bacon on it! Servers were friendly, welcoming as if we were regulars. Serving sizes were huge and well-priced for a place in the city (West Loop). Craft beer selection was very good for a small diner, food was presented with care and intentionality."
"I live a block away from this place and I've been wanting to try it.  After a couple failed attempts due to really long wait times, my husband and I finally got in for an early dinner last Friday.  We were very excited!!The place is tiny (used to be a tiny fast food gyro place so I expected this), the tables are close together, but it doesn't feel too overwhelming.  The menu is diner food, a real get in and get out type of place.  No appetizers on the menu, not even an option here, which is a disappointment.  We ended up ordering the friend chicken and the ham and cheese fondue.  Both were good, the cheese fondue was clearly loaded in butter and really rich.  The chicken was good, but nothing too special.  We ordered a side of bacon too....which was very good, but I hate to say it, I've had better at Publican.  Probably my favorite was the side of smashed potatoes that we ordered, they were awesome.Food was good, but didn't wow us.  It was very filling and rich, led to gross thanksgiving full feeling which is sexy on a Friday night.I think we'll try it at least one more time and order some different things before giving up....maybe on a week night next time."
"Hands down, The best bacon cheeseburger I've ever had! The fries were amazing, as well as the cider beer I had!!!!! Super yummy! Love the dim lighting, cool music, and friendly staff. Amazing."
I love this place!!!! I wish I could add stars.EVERYTHING I have tried here is sooo yummyMy top 31st. Chicken Livers with the butter toast -I could eat that for every meal for the rest of my life2nd. THE BURGER- so simple yet so yummy. The meat is full of flavor and the toppings just add to the mouth watering goodness.3rd. The Wings- cooked perfectly crispy with the sweet delicious sauce***They don't take reservations so be prepared for a long wait on the weekends.***
Took my sister and her husband here while they were visiting. The highlights of the meal were my servers description of any food item. She's quite gifted with emotive language and turning me on with food imagery. The hostess was awesome and quite the hostess--more like to a home than to a restaurant. I had an incredible cheeseburger that I want every day of my life forever more. Two thumbs up for the ambience. I'd say that covers it all. I will be bringing my ass back here soon to try every other food item on the menu.
"The wait is crazy long, but the food is definitely worth the wait. Get the General Jane's chicken and the single burger with and egg and bacon slices. One of the best burgers I've had in a long time."
"Went here for a Sunday bruch. I'm not from Chicago, so I actually found this place on Yelp, and the reviews were right on. We had the Burger au Cheval, fries with an egg and mornay sauce, and an off the menu special of chili con carne. The Burger was fantastic, and the thick cut bacon was an excellent complement, along with their sauce. The fries were wonderful, though I would have liked a bit more zip to the mornay sauce, but that's just a personal preferance - I can;t fault the preparation. The chili was really excellent as well, spicy and flavorful. Service was also top notch.  I would highly recommend Au Cheval to anyone."
"Less IS more!Brunch review - First things first. Get there by 10am! Limited items on menu, but less is good. Their bologna sandwich is amazing! And their french pressed coffee is AMAZING! Best I ever had!"
"Yep, still five stars, and dare I even say it was BETTER than my first experience? I wish I could be a glutton and eat here every day.The boyfriend and I decided to take two of our friends from out of town who were visiting this past Friday to Au Cheval as they both had never been to a Gastropub/New American style restaurant (gasp!). We decided to have an early dinner and arrived around 5:30 to ensure that we'd get a table without having to wait. We told our friends that we'd be ordering for the table after explaining that the food can be served family style. They weren't very adventurous eaters so we decided to pour some salt in the wound and pick items that you can't find at most restaurants (and that are insanely delicious).We all put in a drink order, and I decided to try their Old Fashioned to accompany my meal. Best drink decision of the night from the presentation of the drink in the chilled highball glass with three large ice cubes, three boozy cherries, and a wonderful mashup of whiskey, bitters, and simple syrup. I nursed that baby through the entire meal and it complimented all of our food choices nicely. As for the food, here we go:1) Bone Marrow: This was the one that shocked our friends the most, we got the apprehension and disgust right off the bite, but brushed them off with the ""fine, more for me"" response if they didn't like it. When this was placed in front of us, their jaws hit the ground, and I'm still not for sure if it was in a good way or bad. The bones are MASSIVE with the dish, being around eight inches long, and you get TWO of them. Normally at other places where I've ordered this (ie Longman and Eagle) they're about a quarter of the size. The bone marrow was incredibly succulent--very fatty and had a wonderful flavor to it. What I loved about Au Cheval's spin on this was how they slathered a generous helping of pork cheek all over the marrow. Take the sweet pork cheek with the rich bone marrow and slather it on a piece of Texas toast and you will be transported to a blissful state. You'll definitely need to order another side of the toast (which is perfectly toasted and nicely buttered) in order to finish this bad boy off.2) Foie Gras Rabbit Liver Patte: Here's another one that scared our company, but as promised, it was delicious. It was a 3"" by 3"" square of heaven served with a side of tart cherries. The richness of the foie gras with the light meaty flavor of the liver was intense, in a good way. A little bit of this went a long way on its own but the cherries really kicked up the flavor and balanced it out. This too was served over some Texas toast which gave a nice buttery crunch to each bite. Yum.3) General Janes Chicken: See my previous review. FANTASTIC as always, and this was one of the favorites of the group. I could seriously just come back and eat this... and it's ruined me for Chinese restaurants.4) The ""Single"" Double burger: Why oh why did I not get this the first time we came here?! This is the upscale version of the fast food burger. Two small patties covered in melty American cheese nestled into a traditional bun. The meat was flavorful and the cheese really sealed the deal on this one. As far as burgers go, this is now #2 on my list behind Owen and Engine and before Kumas. Definitely get this if you can, and we learned from our experience that you CAN split a burger four ways, although I wish I could've eaten the entire thing on my own.5) Fries Au Cheval: See my previous review--these were just as good this time around. I'm quickly learning that I like anything with a fried egg on top.6) Side of thick cut bacon: Amazing. Solid. Fantastic. I could list every positive word in my vocabulary and I'd still come up short. Best bacon of my life? Probably so. You must get this bacon, especially if you're getting the burger or eating the breakfast items. Yummers.Desserts:1) Root Beer Float: A&W move aside (although we all know this wasn't even a contender as soon as Au Cheval put a root beer float on the menu). The rootbeer had a slight bite to it, wasn't incredibly carbonated, but was fantastic with the vanilla ice cream. A great root beer float and a great way to end the meal... I'll probably be getting this again.2) Milk Chocolate Gelato: Alrighty, I'll open this door and say that I'm USUALLY not a fan of Gelato, but Au Cheval put me in my place. This was incredibly creamy and chocolaty but not over the top sweet. It was served with a small side of hot fudge that enhanced the flavor of the milk chocolate without covering it up. I think there were two scoops (maybe three?) that were easily shared between the four of us. Although, after polishing off these two desserts I was beyond food coma.Au Cheval, I still love you."
"Au Cheval is one of my staples.  I recommend sitting at the bar and I usually only come with one other person because it's much easier to get in quickly that way. I haven't ventured outside of the cheeseburger or bologna sandwich for dinner because they're both so good.  For breakfast I always order the salmon rilette if it's available, when it's not (9/10 it isn't) I get the chilaquilles or the cheeseburger- yeah a cheeseburger for breakfast because it's that good."
"Thin burger patties + secret sauce + AMAZING bacon + scallion covered fried egg = THE BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER EATEN!Not much more to say than that. Diner is tight, but booths are roomy once you're in one. Lots of craft brews on tap and a small, but tasty selection of cocktails as well.Highly recommend!"
"Really, how can you go wrong with a place that has an option to add thick bacon to pretty much everything? Their double burger comes with 3 amazingly cooked patties, and is cooked to perfection. The 32 oz port porterhouse is spectacular. Don't forget the pickleback whiskey shots. Every place should offer a pickle back option! Flavors all dance together happily in my mouth (that sounds very.. yeah.. but it's the truth). The only thing is, the place is not that big and they don't take reservations, so you may end up waiting quite a long time. The horsie does not disappoint!"
Would go back for beers and the fried chicken but the menu is really small.  I'm happy they are in the hood.
Great burger and ambience. I would recommend the experience just for the selection of good beers. Experience was rather flawless. Strange thing to notice but the soap in the bathroom was the best I have every used at a restaurant. Just real facts here.
"I came here for brunch with a visitor from out of town wanting a great burger.  I can't review anything else on the menu but this cheeseburger is the best burger I've ever had.  I got it without the egg because egg yolk grosses me out and added bacon which I recommend everybody do because the bacon here is amazing.We came on a Saturday around 12:30 and were told it'd be a 45 minute wait but it was more like 25 minutes.  They take your number and text you so you don't have to stick around, which is great.  Service was excellent, prices are reasonable and portions are plenty.  Definitely check this place out, even if just to try this delicious burger."
"Great food and worth the wait. The bar area is very small, so it's better to wait down the road at a different restaurant/bar. The burgers are as good as billed as are the bologna sandwich and marrow bones. I wasn't a fan of the chopped liver, but that was perhaps because we always made a creamier version of chopped liver growing up. Maybe the best meal for under $20 in the city."
"If you're looking for a very nice hipster/rustic establishment, this is it. Features a simple menu, very good food, and some great drink selections. Service was nice - they let us come in RIGHT before they closed their kitchen so we ordered as quick as we could. The atmosphere is nice. It's a small place - maybe fits 60-80 people tops - most of the tables are booths. Pricing is standard - I'd recommend if this is something you enjoy. =)"
"I'm really not sure what all the hype about this place is about. I went there on a Thursday evening (9ish) along with three girlfriends. The place was packed and the hostess offered us to wait by the bar. When we settled in, a very rude waiter asked us to move because we could not stand by that side by the bar and that we needed to move a foot to the left. Anyway, when we finally got seated it was close to 10pm so we ordered two burgers to split among 4 girls. The waitress was extremely annoyed with us that we were splitting food. The burgers were mediocre at best, the fries were saggy ... not sure if they were off their game that night since a lot of reviews rave about their food. But we were extremely disappointed both by the food and the horrible service."
"I'm excited to write this review! I was here on Saturday for brunch with my boyfriend. There was a little bit of a wait, but the staff was great and accommodating and checked in and apologized (it wasn't even that long of a wait). We split the burger (with added bacon) and fries. All components of the burger were perfect. I can't even wrap my head around the bacon that they make. We sat at the bar where you can watch your food being cooked. The cooks even checked in to make sure we liked everything. I really can't say enough about how great the staff is here. Actually the main reason I felt compelled to write this review in the first place was because of one person in particular: the bartender/barista (I think her name was Alex- short hair, flowery dress)  I'm not sure why they only have one bartender working to make drinks for the entire packed place but it did not matter because this girl was working her ass off and got everything done fast and efficiently. 5 stars for Alex!"
Amazing Spot!!  Great toons and even better food!  On the road traveling... thanks to yelp for recommending this place!
"One of the best burgers I've ever had! We're already planning our next visit. You have to tell them how you want your burger cooked though, otherwise it'll be close to medium (I like mine well). Smashed potatoes and fries were great too. They play good music and they're open late too... Loved it!"
"Yum yum yummy- Au Cheval was recommended to me because of the bone marrow dish they have. It was very delicious. We had to wait just a few minuets to be seated and our waitress was extremely nice. She had another waitress shadowing her which was awkward because she was kind of rude. I asked for something and she looked at me brought it to the table when I said thank you she didn't respond. Whatever I guess if your in training you really should put your best feet forward. But the food was good great atmosphere, small dimly lit loud and we loved it. We will be back"
"My wife took me here for my birthday this year.  I had wanted to try it since it opened a few months ago.  Love the atomsphere, it's got a very warm vibe.  Our server was a little robotic, but she was friendly and the service was quick.  I got the burger with bacon and an egg, my wife got General Chos fried chicken.  The burger was really awesome,  one of the best I've had but I wish I could have gotten something fresh on it like arugula, tomato, or fresh onion.  It just felt so heavy.  The fries were great too.  I tried my wifes chicken.  The flavor was good, but a bit saucy which took away from the crispiness of the chicken.  This isnt a place I would eat at every week, but on occasion it will be for us.  I'd definitely recommend - and I do want to try their brunch.  We'll be back."
"The best burger in Chicago! Forget about Kuma's, butcher and burger, burger bar, lockdown - all good but they are not au cheval. Great food all together. Cocktails are also great. This place is small and it can have a long wait but it's worth it!!"
"Tied for #1 with Publican in my opinion. Excellent atmosphere, music and service. What you should try:EverythingWhat you have to try:Burger w/ fried egg on topFries (the mayo dipping sauce is unreal)Mashed Potatoes (whole roasted garlic cloves in them)Bone Marrow with beef cheek marmalade (potentially the best thing I've ever had)The beer selection is just the cherry on top. Go to Au Cheval."
"Perfection on a bun. I appreciate a restaurant with a strong front of house. When we arrived and put our name down, we were told it would be about an 70-75 minutes for a table. She took our number and said it might be earlier and let us know that we could probably find a spot at the bar at Maude's for a pre-dinner drink. Sure enough, we did, the drink was great and precisely when we were debating whether or not to order another one, the phone rang. Table was ready, perfect timing!We came for the burger and no one wanted to be the guy that didn't get the burger, so it was burgers all around. There was a collective sigh/moan out of everyone at our table after the first bite. Perfection through simplicity. Fries are served with aioli, not ketchup and I wouldn't have it any other way. There's nothing that could make this thing better. It's salty, yes. And you will need a serious cup o' water next to your bed for the 3am cotton mouth that will set in, but it is oh-so-worth it."
"Had the cheese burger (with egg) and the mornney fries. The burger was a.....ma.....zing. The flavors hit all the right notes, While I was eating it I was thinking, ""man that's a good burger."" But after I finished I was suddenly sad that the burger experience was over. The mornney fries are a bit of a mixed bag, the garlic aoli was good, the hollandaise was pretty good, but the egg.... Didn't quite work. When I created a forkful of egg fries and both sauces I understood the taste the chef was going for, but it's too messy to work."
"I don't think I can truly explain what I just experienced. Ok, let me set the stage, I am coming back from college and I haven't eaten all day and want a burger. Any burger will do. So my dad drags me into this restaurant that he's been to before. It looked French, I love French food, but I want a burger, it's Saturday like 12:30, lunch time not dinner time. We get in there. The hostess is super nice, sassy just really really awesome. We get seated at the bar in like 10 minutes (I hear that this is not the norm), not bad considering the place is PACKED. We sit down and both order burgers immediately, I get mine with a fried egg and my dad gets his with bacon. We also order fries. So we are sitting at the bar, which is also the kitchen and we are watching food getting prepared, which is incredible. Fast, accurate and insane. We then see a muffin get put on the grill and we are wondering what they are doing. We watch it get platted and delivered... to us. Let me be clear we did not order this muffin, but we should have. It was a fresh baked blueberry muffin, fried and served with butter and strawberry preserves. I LOST IT. I was done, this was one of the best things I ever ate. Pretty soon the fries get delivered, oh, with béarnaise sauce. Ketchup doesn't exist in this place, and that is perfectly fine with me because it was like fat on top of fat. YUM. Then the burgers got delivered seconds after our fries. Ok, so the egg (which I watched cook by itself with love) was lovely and I had to apologize to it when I turned it over and made it melt over burger. After properly cutting the burger in half, I took a bite and my world changed. I think I cried, but I don't remember exactly what happened, mostly I look down and the first half of my burger was gone. I then start feeling woozy, but push through and failed. I couldn't finish the burger (DAMN YOU MUFFIN!!!) and I burped, epically. The hostess looked over and said, ""You must have enjoyed that!"" Yes, yes I did. YOU MUST GO TO THIS PLACE. I can't even."
"This place is very unassuming from the outside, with smoke tinted windows and an understated 'Au Cheval' sign proclaiming it's existence.  The interior, however, was warm and inviting, with a steel-plated bar, deep booths promising privacy flanking the walls, and 30ish very well thought out beers on tap greeting you upon entering.My girlfriend and I started off with the bread and butter pickles, which were sweet with a light white vinegar tartness.  They were excellent.  She then had the griddled bratwurst, which was perfectly cooked and served on mashed potatoes.  I had the General Jane's honey-fried chicken, which was double deep fried and tasted like a better version of Korean barbeque, crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.  The sauce was a bit too sweet and overpowered towards the end, but thats nitpicking.The worst thing we had were the hash browns, which were too thick and hence soft in the middle.  They couldve been cooked longer.Drinks were solid, if not spectacular.  Overall, worth going and would go back."
"Amazing!!! Went on a rainy Wednesday night, and the place was packed. The cocktails were nice and strong, and delicious. We had the bone barrow with beef cheek marmalade and chicken liver for dinner, both of which were great. Highly recommend this place."
"best burger EVER !!!!!! heard about it on the grape vine and threathnedc to go for weeks ,i can still taste the burger in my mouth 4 weeks later!!"
"Au brother! Took my girlfriend here around 5:00 PM today. Upon entering the hostess was nice enough but our waitress was curt and disinterested from start to finish.  I ordered a hearty, salty take on Matzah Ball soup that was pretty good and a double cheeseburger with a fried egg on top. Our waitress brought me a burger with bacon instead of an egg. I didn't send the burger back because our waitress was giving off the vibe that she could not be bothered. In any event, I thought I might enjoy it...The burger was a big ol' sloppy, greasy mess. It tasted like a slightly elevated Wendy's burger, and trust me, this is not a good thing. I took the bacon off because it was soggy, more like Canadian bacon and had some sort of sickly sweet barbecue style sauce that reminded me of McDonalds BBQ sauce. Gross. My girlfriend ordered a salad to start which came in a heaping portion in a small bowl, on a giant plate. She poured the salad out onto the plate only to discover a large piece of paper in the salad.  Her entree, the General Jane's Chicken was drenched in corn syrupy gunk and she just stopped eating it after a couple of bites. Our waitress did not seem to care that her expensive entree had gone uneaten and that she did not want a box. No, ""how was everything?"" She also referred to me as ""man"" at the end of the meal. While this is something I call friends all of the time, I would never expect it from a server at a nice restaurant who has made no effort to break formality with us in any other respect. Having ordered no alcoholic drinks our meal came out to around $80.00, 90+ with tip. We left feeling swindled, sick, and confused that so many people have nothing but good things to say about Au Cheval."
"Five stars for the fantastic cheeseburger. Everyone in my group had a burger, and all around everyone agreed they are excellent. I definitely plan on making it back for another burger."
"A friend of our recommended this place and we went there a couple of weeks ago before a Bulls game.  They do not take reservations but luckily we were willing to sit at the bar and did not have to wait.Burger - Excellent!!!Grilled Cheese Sandwich Fondue - Very GoodGarlic Mashed Potatoes - GoodRoot Beer on Draft - Not a fan of root beer in general, but this was Good!"
"3.5 stars.I have been in food service for a while, and I understand having a difficult shift, or being swamped. There was no wait while I was here, full tabels - yes, but no wait.I had accidentally parked in a tow zone, and sent my friend in while I parked my car. Her drink order was taken before I returned the restaurant. I sat down, and her drink came, her usual Old Fashioned (she usually gets 3 cherries, but forgot to ask) so I told her I would get one with 3 and give her the extra.When the waitress came to me, she asked if I wanted anything to drink. I said an Old Fashioned with 3 cherries. She shot back with ""no. absolutely not. 2 is the maximum amount of cherries allowed in that drink"" I thought it was diner shtick and was waiting for a smile. When someone else brought my drink back with only 2 cherries, I knew she wasn't joking. She came back to take our order, she didn't bring it to the table, and came back once to ask if everything was alright (without looking at the table one, she was too interested in the tip she received from another table) and then rushed us out. All at like 545 pm. It left a really bad taste in my mouth, because there was no attempt at all from her to be nice to us. Whenever I looked over she was standing at the server station.The reason I didn't leave was the burger I ordered. Cooked to perfection. Amazing toppings. I can't... it was SO good. I would go back and subject myself to less than stellar service for this burger a thousand times. Great food, lousy server. Having a ""maxiumum cherry limit"" seems a bit obnoxious. If I had an explanation, rather than an immediate shut down, things would be different. but, seriously... who doesn't care about their table that much? IT'S YOUR JOB."
"My foodie friends took me here for my birthday and I had a fantastic time.  We were able to get a booth for 6 people with no problems.  I heard that this was the place to have a good burger.  While I don't think it was the best burger I've had, it is a pretty darn good burger.  The crispy fries with mornay sauce was amazing.  Also, you have to have the puff pastry dessert with vanilla creme.  I would go back for fries and dessert for sure."
"We went at 5:30 on a Monday, and were promptly seated. Delicious juicy burgers, but we felt our cheeseburgers were too salty.  Great fries and salad. We'll be back."
"I walked in during a very busy Saturday night a few weeks ago.  I had to wait about a half hour just to get a spot at the bar.  The restaurant staff however were very cognizant of my wait and continued to reassure me that they were keeping an eye on the bar for an open seat.  I could tell immediately that customer service was a high priority at this establishment.  Once seated, I ordered a french cocktail that was skilfully made by a very cute bartender and the cocktail tasted old school and yummy.  I had heard that the burger here is very good based upon which I ordered the burger with bacon (which turned out to be more like two healthy delicious pieces of pork belly) and an egg.  Every thing is better with bacon and a warm, runny egg on it.  It was interesting to sit at the bar where, right in front of you, the frenetic activities of the chefs occur in front of you  It was fun to watch.  The burger was very good, not exceptional, yet very good.  I would go back to try other items on their menu.  One could tell that the restaurant's creator, Brendan Sodikoff, places great emphasis on the ambiance, design and overall feel of the restaurant.  I would characterize the look as french, progressive diner with creative, gourmet comfort food.  The music was a significant contributor to the positive, hip and creative vibe.  A place that I recommend to anyone.  Well done Brendan."
"Without exception, the best cheeseburger I have ever had in my entire life! I mean, so good it should be illegal in New York and if Mayor Bloomberg ever visits I'm certain it will be on hit list. Just happened to stumble in on a Saturday night after having a few drinks down the street on Randolph's Restaurant Row.  Our waitress gave us the head's up when we told her we were looking for a quick bite with a cool atmosphere. She couldn't have made a more perfect choice. Although its a fairly intimate space it feels both cozy and cool. Our waitress pointed out that the kitchen would be open for 5 more minutes when we walked in and said we couldn't go wrong with the cheeseburger. Holy Schnikes! It was out of this world good and paired with a great beer and fries. The place kind of had the vibe of the original Iggy's on Milwaukee. (and for me, that's saying something)Industry vets turning out simple but perfectly executed dishes. Can't wait to go back!"
"I love this place. I can't wait to go back. The beer list is awesome, though kind of overwhelming. The atmosphere is very relaxed and perfect for a date night or with friends. They put a fried eggs on your fries and give you sauces worthy of gods. The burger is TO DIE FOR! I had the crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy. It had a little too much sausage, but was amazing. I'm coming back as soon as I can. I loved it."
"Fantastic diner spot.. Like a gourmet, uber-trendy greasy spoon. I had the single cheeseburger (the single is actually a double and the double is a triple) which was the BEST BURGER I've ever had. Many other diners agree with me. The burger kind of reminds you of McDonald's in a way, but it's just the best possible burger done in that style, it's served on brioche bun with just two slim patties, housemade pickles, minced red onion, sharp American cheese and dijonnaise (Dijon and Mayo, evidently). Fantastic. My lady had the duck heart hash, which was pretty good, but could have used more duck heart. Or maybe we just can't get enough of that organ. Highly recommended are the fries, get them with a fried egg and Mornay."
"Great brunch. To top it off they had Doughnut Vault glazed doughnuts. WOW. Had their burger, excellent"
"We just went for drinks, but I have to say I loved the laid back atmosphere for such a trendy place. I also loved that the waiters/cooks/bar backs were drinking the dom perignon of beers while working. Miller High Life. Doesn't everyone deserve their piece of heaven? Yes, yes they do."
"Amazing burger -I recommend adding the egg and bacon, and a really intesting beer list! Been here twice for work lunch, can't wait to take my wife out here for a dinner date!"
"went back for brunch... hehehehehehe again. ended up getting the simple breakfast... which includes light fluffy buttery scrambled eggs, yummy peppered bacon, and texas-y french toast. alllllllll delicious... so after asking one of the servers the secret to the eggs... which apparently involved whipping melted butter into the eggs ... i cant stop thinking about eggs!!! theyre soo delicious and the bacon... ive compared the bacon at au cheval vs. bavettes and they are distinctly different. i felt like the bacon at au cheval is more peppercorn-y and super good!!ooh and their reel to reel.... oh its not fake.... its real and its fabulous... so when i asked the hostess... she mentioned that they make their own mixes to play on their reel to reel.... uh coolness factor goes up again!!their iced coffee is my go to drink... side note: it was a saturday morning that i hit up au cheval and someone else thought that it was a good opportunity to try america's #1 burger... david guetta. hahaha ... au cheval is always a good time.and thank you for introducing me to picklebacks with jameson... i have been forcing them upon all my friends and making new friends because of its awesomeness."
"This joint is one of the best additions in Chicago as of late!Came here through recommendation - the vibe/interior is relaxing, warm and rustic. Au Cheval's menu is a French-influenced type American diner fare. If you're watching your weight, Au Cheval should be your cheat day.Here's what I had (been here twice):Honey Fried Chicken - SOO crispy yet really thinly crispy, sweet, perfectly cooked. Enough for 2.Single Cheeseburger - I have never, ever had a restaurant burger that was as well seasoned as this one was. It's a thin patty cooked perfectly so that there's a little bit of a crispiness on the edges. It was sooo delicious, I feel like everytime I crave a burger, it's going to be Au Cheval's. Perfection. (A single is a double, and a double is a triple BTW)Raw Veggie Salad - Fresh, crisp and when you think its not enough, that delicious blue cheese pops up in between bites. Yum.Chopped Chicken Liver - This was delicious, rich and kind of a sweet in a savory way (if that makes sense) dish. Very filling - I would recommend sharing this one. Don't keep it to yourself.Bone Marrow + Oxtail Marmalade - I'm a sucker for bone marrow anywhere - Au Cheval's is good but a little bit too sweet with the Marmalade. I wouldn't order it again.Crispy Fries + Fried Egg + Mornay Sauce - Why would you go here and not order this? The most crisp french fries I've had and I loved the aioli more than the Mornay actually. Anything with a fried egg on top? That's a no brainer.The music here is awesome. They record their own playlist and actually play it on that contraption in front of the restaurant. Also a really great place to take a date - the warm lighting makes anyone look good."
"Can any place be more sexy? This place rocks! The salad has more than 10 different kinds of veggie and blue cheese! That alone it has won my votes! The fore gras with egg, is so fatty and so yummy! Many dish has fried eggs on top of it, it is fatty and happy! The waitress are sexy and friendly and the chefs inside the bar handsome and like conversation. I 'd love to come here to get my drinks!"
"I love Au Cheval. The wait, not so much.... Though last time the seating gods smiled favorably upon us and granted us two bar seats with zero wait. I actually like the bar because you can see the chefs in action. The burger is good, the fries au cheval with mornay sauce is tasty, and the matzo ball soup unexpectedly divine. Since it's kinda hipsteriffic, I'm holding hope that Au Cheval will add (Nashville) Hot Chicken to the menu. My husband will be there every other night, versus our usual weekly visit. Highly recommend Au Cheval and looking forward to their upcoming sister Jewish deli in River North!"
Most amazing burger ever!!!!!!! The fried  chicken is also to die for!Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago
"Man I didn't expect to like this place like I do. It's always a bummer when the best burger in town comes from one of the hardest places to get into. Still it was so good. My boyfriend ate the fried chicken and said the same. For him that's saying something. For me I rarely eat burgers, but if I'm going for it, I'll go there from now on. Good music, pretty okay drinks. Sold. Only complaint is the weird trendy vibe in there, but whatever I'll eat that burger and get crap all over my face and I don't care who sees. Can't wait to do it again!"
"We received very fast service and the wait staff was awesome.  We just had a few drinks and burgers with fries.  The burgers are great, but not the best in the city by any stretch.  I grew up on a beef farm and Au Cheval has tiny patties and the flavors are indistinct.  It's like a grown-up version of the McDonald's burger.  It lacks seasoning (just very salty and broiled under a salamander), texture (for the price they charge, I want chopped steak mixed into the ground beef), substance (the double burger is still very manageable, not very big) and it ought to come with fries instead of charging you $7 more for them (they're damn good, though).  I guess I'd say stick to 'the other famous burger place' in town and get something else here.  If I were to theoretically get the burger again, I guess I'd add the $10 bacon that looked really thick-cut and delicious for the texture I wanted from the beef patty.  Maybe I'm just too much of a farm boy for this place in the end.  City people seem really impressed by it, though, but I wager that's because the price tag on the dishes."
"Didn't have to wait too long on a wednesday night. superb service, great ambience, decent food, not too expensive. drinks were strong enough. i am not digging their chicken, however. let me rephrase that. I liked the chicken. it was great, but i know a korean joint where they make this type of chicken, and au cheval aint got nothing on them. having said that, its not just about the foods. they offer you a complete package, and i had a great time."
"This place is great, I had the fried chicken and loved it. I will be back soon.  Great music and ambiance too."
"Can you smile please dearest server? Nope. She couldn't, more like wouldn't. Not sure what kind of ambience this place was going for with their pretentious servers and medieval wall panels and decor. The food though, was their saving grace. Please order their fried chicken. You'll get warm towels to accompany your sauce slathered fingers.  And the sausage and potatoes... oh my goodness... you will not want to share."
"This place has the hands down the best burger I've ever had in the US. I just ordered their regular burger with bacon and an egg, but it was sooo goood. The bacon wasn't just a few strips of bacon you get at an IHOP, there were two huge slabs of juicy bacon on top of the two patties with cheese. Yeah, the single burger still has two patties. And to top it off was the fried egg which was awesome. If you're in Chicago, definitely check this place out. There's also a full bar with good beer so check that out too."
"Great place! Shared a double cheeseburger, fried egg, and  mashed potatoes. Everything was cooked to absolute perfection. This place has delicious food at a fantastic price. Au Cheval is like an innovative old-diner. Same old dishes with a fun twist. Definitely worth having a drink and a bite. Great atmosphere and service."
Best burger in a long time. I had the single with bacon & egg. Ridiculously tasty!! Polite service. Great beer program. Can't wait to come back and try more. This place has character that I enjoy!!
"I always order a burger with my first visit to a restaurant.  Best burger I have had in years! The ""Double"" will satisfy any appetite, but be sure to leave room for the fries.  Amazing quality at an affordable price.  Great service, and great drink choices as well."
"Au Cheval! Oh, Cheval! This bar/restaurant has some of the best beer selection and music around town. Every song that was played was unique and eclectic. My dining companion must have used Shazam for all of the song. The beers were just as great! I wish I had written down which ones I tried since they were equally unique and memorable. They serve food, but we only ordered the fries. I will have to come back for dinner! The atmosphere us beautiful with dim lighting and New York style vibe. I highly recommend this place for late night drinks and good conversation."
"We went to brunch here yesterday morning and it has to be one of the best brunches I have ever had and I do brunch quite a bit.  The full English Breakfast blows Owen and Engine's out of the water.  I love Owen & Engine but Au Cheval's is so much better.  We also had the chilaquiles which was cooked really well.  Most of the Chilaquiles dishes I order are way too soggy and Au Cheval's was very crisp and fresh with a ton of flavor.  Finally, I would not suggest doing this with everything else we ordered unless you want to be too stuffed to walk, but we decided to order the french fries with the fried egg on top with aioli.  Wow!!  Yum!!  All was so incredibly good and P.S., their bloody mary and coffee were also top notch."
"Really great place. I am a big time fan. The restaurant was very comfortable and cozy due to the size, but the decor was great, and I am always a big fan of an open kitchen. The burger was phenomenal, get it au cheval style with the bacon. The bacon is effectively peppered pork belly, sliced thin more than thick-cut bacon. And it was some of the best I have ever had.The fries were really excellent and crisp, exactly how they should be. The matzah ball soup was very good. About as good as matzah ball soup can be (not sure matzah ball soup can be mind-blowing, but it was as good as it can be). One thing that surprised me on yelp were the reviews of the service. The comments were typically pretty harsh on the service. I felt our server was very good. Very helpful with pairing a beer to the burger, very friendly and never at all felt rushed. I really liked this restaurant, 2 for 2 with Sodikoff restaurants and it only makes me more excited to try all the other projects he is working on."
"Good beer. Decent place. My friend ordered a single cheeseburger and I ordered a double w/ egg and bacon. The hipster waitress pauses, looks at us and says, ""just so you know the single is a double and the double is actually a triple."" We just give her the ""not sure if serious"" look for ~5 seconds, and then she walks away. Life in the big city."
"You have to be in the right mood for this sort of food - greasy, meaty, uber-flavorful big portions - but if you are, get there asap. And get there early. They don't take reservations. We managed to snag a table on a Thursday night just before 7pm but it was packed soon thereafter. Beer selection pretty good, though not great compared to how many gastropubs now have even more comprehensive beer menus. Like others have mentioned, burgers, bone marrow, pork chops, fries with fried eggs, chopped liver, etc. - it's all there. I didn't see much at all on the lighter side, so I wouldn't go with daintier diners."
"rich, finger licking delicious food. service, not very pleasant, total grin and bear it attempt (waitress i'm talking about you). i felt like someone was constantly trying to remove a plate or glass, don't know how many time we said, ""no, not yet... no, not yet..."" au cheval, you have a wonderful space and memorable food, please let your guests savor the experience."
"Best. Burger. Ever. Seriously, just one of the most amazing restaurants in Chicago all around. DMK and their garbage grassfed well done burgers can piss off, there is no substitute for amazing, high fat, coarse ground, corn fed beef. This place is a must visit."
Kitchen was closed but we stopped and had a drink instead- and the server brought us a muffin from brunch to hold us over.  Great drinks awesome energetic service!  Can't wait to go back!
"Not sure if I can distinctively say this is the best burger in Chicago, but it's definitely up there as a serious contender.  the bacon/pork belly on top is just ridiculous.   Even the fried bologna sandwich blew away whatever expectations I had for this.  I just heard it was kind of crazy but kind of good, so I ordered it.  Those are my 2 go to items I rotate between.  Asian style wings are really good too."
Deliciously decadent. You will want to go to there now.
"Came her for lunch last Friday.  For the price, wow.  This is tough to beat.  I got the cheeseburger with bacon and topped with an egg.  The bacon was awesome - thick cut, but melt in your mouth.  The burger was juicy and the egg yolk just complemented the whole burger.  Honestly, this might be the best burger I've ever had.  The fries were very good...crisp and fresh.  Had a taste of the honey fried chicken and the ham and cheese fondue as well.  Everyone's food was delicious.  Will definitely look to go back when visiting Chicago again."
"Fantastic place. Had the chicken liver appetizer, burger and fries - all of it amazing. And very indulgent."
"I discovered this place last week as we were waiting for a taxi in the West Loop and it's my favourite find in Chicago. Great atmosphere, good food, just a really cool place. Perfect for a late night date."
"i have been here twice in the past month or so.the first time was 3 stars--matzah ball soup was just missing something, and they took it off our bill because people usually love the dish (matzah ball soup was what i always ate when i was sick as a kid, so fond memories. perhaps i have high matzah standards).the second time was 4.5 stars, probably because we threw caution to the wind and ordered the fried chicken, a burger, and the fries with a fried egg. no complaints here on those dishes.you definitely pay a couple extra dollars on the beer for where you are, but they definitely have a smart beer guy, good selection of IPAs"
"A great late night stop! Lots of great beers to choose from and the atmosphere is fun and lively. I've only ordered a about 5 different things on the menu but I have determined that that absolute best thing on the menu is the foie gras and scrambled eggs. If you check this place out, you have to get it. But be careful! It is a heavy item and you will probably want to go to bed after!"
"burger is sooooo good! the greens salad is a little weird, i got basically a huge bowl of greens with a light vinagrette, very ""rabbit food""y. but everything was great, including the service!"
"very nice atmosphere. service was quick and very attentive (maybe a little bit pushy).great selection of both local and imported beers.The honey-fried chicken was very good; fried bologna sandwich was good too.Stunning sides, especially the mashed potato with gravy and the hash browns.Top it off with a delightful mille feuille dessert and you'll get a very nice dining experience."
"Great Caesars Ghost!...what a great place....my wife and i visited had a really nice late on a sunday night(10-ish) and when we arrived , were told there was a 30 minute wait....which turned into an 8 minute wait when 2 seats at the counter became available....having a seat at the counter gave me a great view of what surely has to be one of the hardest working crews in the city....it was really cool watching these dudes in action...dinner and a show!......the beer selection here is really esoteric and has something for everyone, a great mix of domestic and imported taps that compliment the excellent food....sweet baby jebus...The Food!.....we started out with the fries with mornay sauce and garlic aioli...what a rich and satisfying way to start a meal...fries were crispy and the 2 different sauces complimented them quite perfectly.....the missus had the single burger with bacon and an egg and I had the fried bologna sandwich with an egg.....both were awesome and so good, we decided to split each dish so we had a taste of heaven x2....we ended the meal with the mille feuille.....omg....such a great, decadent ending to an epic meal.....flaky pastry with sweet pastry cream...about 8 inches tall....heaven on a plate......I must mention the excellent, friendly, attentive service from the time we entered till the time we left.....the hostess found seats for us in a very timely fashion and our server Erica(I hope i spelled this right) was really nice and very personable, which really made the overall experience that much more enjoyable....as we sat at the counter, the cooks asked us how everything was and Im sure i said the word outstanding about 70 times.....its the small personal interactions that really make this place stand out...and I cannot wait to visit again!"
"My friend and I stopped by Au Cheval after work in the Loop a few weeks ago.  We went on a week day around 5:30, so we were able to be seated right away at the counter.  The beer selection is fantastic, and even better, the waiters are knowledgeable about the beer.  We each ordered a single (yes, it's a double) cheeseburger with egg on top.  The burger was absolutely delicious.  If you sit at the counter, you get to watch the cooks prepare everything which is pretty fascinating to watch.  I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone for an after work dinner."
"Perfect spot for a late or late-late dinner. Bring your out-of-town guests here and they will be very impressed.  The food is incredible. They do refined-diner food the way it should be. The burger is seriously one of the best I've ever had. The bone marrow with beef-cheek marmalade??--HELLO! Incredible. Delicious fries-get the egg on top. Get an egg on everything--it's their shtick and it works. Great drinks-try the Hemingway Daiquiri. We were too full to order dessert, but I definitely want to go back again and again and again. The only reason they aren't getting 5 stars is because our waitress was forgetful and condescending. After telling us that wasting food was her pet-peeve, she took the pickles away before I was finished! Not enough to keep us away though."
"Love.  Love.  Love.  Delicious, thoughtful, creative food that isn't crazy expensive.  You can go as healthy as you want - salads and the fish of the day are both great.  I've had the salmon a couple of times and it is just fresh, simple, and perfectly cooked. Or you can go all in with the fries, with gravy and egg on top - YUM.  Love most of the appetizers (great accompaniments with the pate type ones) and the burger.  While I am addicted to the matzo ball soup at Manny's (love me some sodium), many folks love Au Cheval's soup. Not a fan of the bologna sandwich, I'm from TN - THAT'S not bologna:)  When we cannot decide where to go and just want a delicious meal, we head that way."
Completely lives up to the hype. You have only yourself to blame if you do not eat the hamburger here.
"We showed up after midnight and the late night menu only had 5 things on it. I was a bit nervous about that but then was very surprised by how amazing the food was.  The drinks were great and the atmosphere, fantastic. You need to check this place out!"
Walked in before 6 and no line!
"I visited Au Cheval for the first time last night on a date and loved it. Walking in I was delighted to see so many great beers on tap as well as a couple of lighter options. The drink list and menu are terrific and I'll definitely be back for both. The music was a little loud but enjoyably so and we were still able to talk comfortably at the bar and once seated in one of the many booths. We tried some of the cocktails which were excellent and a couple of the beers. The food was delicious and, frankly, the foie gras and scrambled eggs were perhaps one of the best things I have ever tasted. Absolutely amazing!!! The smoked salmon special appetizer was also out of this world tasty. It sounds kind of ridiculous even mentioning toast but it seems to come with quite a few of the dishes and turns out to be for a good reason. It's one more thing that deceives you with its simplicity but turns out to be spectacular. Some of the other items were less exciting like the side salad which was a generous portion but had been drowned in vinaigrette. We also ordered the shaved bologna sandwich which looked amazing and tasted good but was a little salty for my own taste. None of the dishes looked particularly filling but we were in the mood for sampling and this was actually more than we probably needed for just the 2 of us.It was a fun experience and definitely on my list of restaurants worth going back to again and again. Since other reviews mention the wait, even on a Thursday evening we were told that it would be 45 minutes before there would be a booth. However, there was space at the bar and we were actually seated in a booth within 15-20 minutes. I've got to say that I love it when things work out."
"What a crazy, eclectic, unique spot. We came her after we oh-so-naively tried to hit up the goat and the fig at 10pm on a Friday. Tourists - clearly, we were clueless. But, Au cheval seated us within 5 minutes, and I have to say that the service was awesome. The food wasn't anything that I'd normally pick - eggs and fried food, but it was delicious. We shared a salad, a burger and had two oh-so-delcious moscow mules. Next time I'm back I want to try to the fried chicken."
Decided to try out this place when the hubby and I had a sudden hankering for a burger...They didn't have a huge burger menu but we ended up 2 burgers..one with bacon & one with egg. The bacon was out of this world and was not the traditional bacon...the burgers were cooked to perfection!!
"The place very intimate. My friend and I sat at the bar, and were mesmerized by the talented bartenders. Very good drinks, but pricey! I had the single cheeseburger and it was very good too. More of a fancy burger, but very good. My friend had the fried bologna sandwich, and she really liked it too. Very friendly staff. Will definitely come back."
"I have been there 4-5 times now and I was a huge fan of the food. I had remembered the fries with the aioli to be amazing, but when I ordered it this past it weekend, it was way too salty. I was grabbing for my drink with every fry. Note, the food here is heavy and good. The bologna sandwich and chicken wings will leave your taste buds in ecstasy, but your waist line busting. Over all I was pretty pleased with this place, that was until I had extremely rude service this weekend. This past weekend we had waited 2hours for our reservation and hustled out of our booth. Even after we paid our bill and were finishing our drinks, the hostess rudely pushed us out of the way, not even considering that we just paid the bill a minute ago. Our waitress was kind enough to find us after and apologize on behalf of the hostess, and that she recognized our faces from the previous times we've been there. Sadly, I am very disappointed and this has dropped my rating severely - for having all the right parts I really hope that we were just a fluke and that quality is not being traded in for maximizing numbers and profit."
"The service here was so snarky, they could put an Aeroflot flight crew to shame. We came with a party of 3 at 11 on a Saturday. Hostess was cold and unfriendly and informed us the wait was 20 minutes but we could wait near the bar. Attempted to take 2 open seats at the bar and were shooed away by a waitress who told us bar seating was by waitlist only. Fine, we get it, the place is small. Stood for 15 minutes repeatedly trying to get the bartender's attention until he deigned it fit to inform us that we could only be served by a waiter. We asked where the waiter was. Stood 5 more minutes until angry bro-waiter arrived, snapped at my friend for asking questions about the beer list, and took his sweet time getting drinks back to us. Watched a party of 4 that arrived after us and obviously knew the staff get seated instantly in a booth. We were seated at a round table with 3 chairs next to the beverage stand. Placed our order uneventfully and waited in cramped space for food to arrive. A friend was in the area and attempted to join us. She walked in and asked hostess for our table. The hostess told her ""yes, that is a party of 3, and you are 4."" Our friend asked if she could at least be allowed in to say hello. The hostess replied, ""I don't know."" The table behind us was friendly and offered up an extra chair for our friend to join. We were immediately reprimanded by a waitress. She stated that staff needed to be able to walk behind our table. We offered to scoot ourselves closer together around the opposite side of the table to accommodate, as food was arriving. No dice. Hostess reprimanded us a second time and put us on the waitlist for a booth. Staff came to carry our plates away and dropped all my silverware into my soup before taking it to the booth. Hostess threw my friend's coat off the back of his chair into my arms, pointed at his iPhone on the table, and left without saying a word or helping me clear any items. After moving, we sat for nearly an hour with empty drinks and no napkin for our friend who had joined before a check was dropped off. It was like some weird Twilight Zone version of overpriced dive dining where the patrons are made to feel like bad kids in the principal's office. If you want a great burger and fries without being treated like garbage, try Grange Hall Burger Bar. Dined there Sunday and LOVED it!"
"Simply top notch.Lovely decor.   Wonderful comfort food.  Great beer selection.  Word of warning to parties of five or more.  It's all four person booths, so lose someone en route!"
great chilaquiles. awsome fries - get it with the garlic aioli as a side. awesome burger - BUT do remember to order it with bacon . the bacon is thick cut and heavenly and brings a different level to the burger. the cocktails are meh but who cares.
"listen. burgers= great, fries= great, overall the late night cuisine is top notch, however,brunch = not greatpeople want this place to be better than it is. brunch should be light and delicious and leave you feeling satisfied on Sunday morning. you should be able to order something unique and adventurous without disappointment. i had the scrambled eggs and fois gras, my boyfriend had the crispy potato hash. the fois gras/scrambled eggs were served in a bowl, the eggs were literally bathing in a soup of duck fat. the fois gras COMPLETELY took over the dish when in reality, a rich fatty meat like that should have been more of a complement. let me tell you, i love fois gras but this dish was quite disgusting. very rich, very savory, and perhaps would have tasted better NOT at 10:30am. but DEFINITELY NOT APPROPRIATE FOR BRUNCH and should not have been one of the 8 choices on the brunch menu. but to be fair, the waitress was very nice and took the dish off our bill. the crispy duck hash was fine. very very heavy. the gravy put it over the top and has you leaving with a bit of a stomach ache.  Overall, this place gets 5 stars for late night/ lunchtime burgers but 1 star for brunch... face it, there are WAY better places out there for brunch (cough little goat and hash/gogo to name a few)"
not much to add here...  their burger and bologna sandwich are both world class.  two of the best sandwiches i've ever had.  period
"This is my new favorite on Randolph.  Beer selection is top notch (I'd go here over haymarket for the beer), the food is exactly what I hoped for in a French restaurant.  I will be back regularly."
Excellent food and I would go back BUT not with kids.  Let me be clear.. Don't take your kids here especially if they are toddlers.  Our children are from 10 to 14. Perhaps it was the complete lack of personality in our server or perhaps it was the fact that we are breeders and breeders are the minority at this restaurant.  I had the bone marrow and cheek marmalade and it was superb but our server was not knowledgeable regarding the beer offerings and just down right snotty.
Heavy food and such a limited selection of fatty foods. I'm from Southern California and I like fresh and healthy food - not without flavor. But I'm just not into so much fry food in duck fat.
"From every angle this place rocks.  Snagged seats at the bar where we could see the culinary artistes in action.  Creating the exceptional Fries with garlic aoli and fried egg on top.  The foie gras with scrambled eggs.  The amazing burger with a hunk O Bacon and cheese.  My arteries can only handle this load once in a while, but I will be counting the days until I can return.  Service rocks, too."
"great meal at au cheval last night. We had the foie gras and scrambled eggs, epic; bone marrow and beef cheek marmalade, could have used some fleur de sel but the marmalade was rocking; the double (which is three patty) burger, lovely; the fries, mornay was floury tasting but the garlic aoli was great and lower calorie; and the fried chicken, which could be crispier but tasted terrific, Good ambiance, v. friendly, organized staff, good atmosphere. Solid. Go."
good circumstances good burger good servant
"Totally worth the wait on a Friday night.  All of our food was delicious and perfectly cooked.  The service was quick, but had a little too much attitude for are liking.  Try the Bratwurst with Smashed Potatoes and gravy, it's amazing!  Our only complaint is that the prices are a bit high for the amount of food you get."
"I don't get it.  Diner food is still diner food.  Had the burger and fries.  The burger was Ok at best but serving thin patties never works when I can name a dozen burgers that are much better than Cheval's.  The fries were on the soggy side but were saved by the aoili.  Is it too much to ask for  ""crispy"" fries.  See page 25 in Bourdain's book about making perfect fries.  Beer list is excellent though.  Will come back for the drinks but not the food.  Service was hipster inane.  Oh, by the way, your music sucks."
Super fab! They told me it would be an hour wait & it only took 10 mins!  Score!  The cheeseburger there is fantastic!!  You def have to get that!  The pear cider is pretty tasty as well. I would def recommend this place!
"4 solid stars.  came here after midnight on a week night.love the concept - lots of reviews seem confused with the concept but i think its a perfect place to go grab food late night!!its a hip-great-food diner.  not a denny's, but a great food, great ingredients, tasty drinks diner.  therefore the prices match the experience.  loved the food.  bold flavors, high calorie eats.  perfect after a night out drinking!*fried chicken - perhaps i didn't read the description well enough but they're basically korean fried chicken!  spicy asian sticky wings.  super tasty.*fries: coated with a fried egg, coupled with a creamy mornay sauce.  super rich but super delicious!beer list was great, tons of great beers on tap.  def return - post midnight!"
"im currently on a hunt to find some of the best burgers in chicago.  so whenever i keep on seeing a list of the best burgers in chicago. this place keeps on popping up. i have to say the burger was wonderful. the bun was super soft. the meat juicy and medium rare like i asked for..  the condiments complimented the burger well. it was seasoned just right.  i also had the fried egg with crispy fries with a mornay sauce and garlic aioli.  i always have my eggs sunny side up. it came perfectly the way i wanted it, the mornay sauce was good.  i finished off my meal with a root beer.  i saw root beer with its own real estate on the menu. just simple.. root beer. something in my brain sang to me and said you must try it. i love it when my intuition is right. folks i think this is probably one of the best root beers i have ever had. i kid you not. i have rarely complimented a drink and i will have to say it is a dam good root beer.  i know the food aspect is what most of the people want to hear but i should mention the service. the service. the service was good/great. its on the borderline. what else can you expect from eating in the areas like black bird down the street and publican down the other. they have set standards in the neighborhood. from the moment i walked in to the time i left i felt welcome and wanted.  the lovely hostess would check up on me to see if everything was good and gave me and my friend updates as to where in the process my table will be ready.  the wait was not bad at all after all i came in during the lunch rush. while i was standing and observing. the hostess was making sure everything was to the restaurant standards. may it be cleaning the glass freeing of the greasy hand marks to making sure the bar is clean. making sure the customer is happy. our waitress was a sassy fun slightly sarcastic girl who looked like she popped out of the world war 2 poster we can do it minus the red bandana instead a blue one.  she was a good/great server. reason being is i cant really deduct much because a rush did hit.  she did check up on us quite abit. made sure everything was good. but there was a slight lull in between  when we received our menu to drinks and ordering. but aside from that everything was great. when i was leaving i got a warm goodbye from the hostess. things like that puts the cherry on top and make you want to come back often."
"obviously this place has amazing burgers. i mean read the reviews people! but this place earns a spot on my favorite Bloody Marys of Chicago list. awesome pickle garnish, and just the right amount of seasonings. mmm mmm good."
